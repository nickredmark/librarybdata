<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:54.809" style="s2">you ever read that book yes not only</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">read that book but Davy bullier</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.809" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">contacted me to help them to work on the</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:05.580" style="s2">needs mentioned there and then I spend a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.520" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">whole week with them in Germany working</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.580" end="00:01:11.130" style="s2">on anthology and patterns for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">Commons so yes read it ah that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.130" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">and as usual listeners we will have</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">links to everything we reference whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">companies websites books papers on the</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">feel like you have to take notes just go</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:26.340" style="s2">to the website Jim rut show calm and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">you&#39;ll have links to everything we</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.340" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">talked about that book I&#39;m about 20% in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">I&#39;m quite taken with him reading it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:34.860" style="s2">slowly and carefully so I guess there</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:37.049" style="s2">was probably a relationship with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.860" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">you know art is work to unlock the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.049" end="00:01:41.640" style="s2">secrets of the social DNA but which</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">people operate and the critical role of</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">patterns he&#39;s also designed lots of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">currency systems the list is almost</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">has started off in the area of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.869" style="s2">collective intelligence was certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:06.600" style="s2">strong interest to our audience she then</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.869" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">began working in communities of intent</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.600" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">intentional communities we might call</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">them in our space and there she realized</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">that money or we would</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:17.879" style="s2">we abstract a little bit and talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">about the social system signaling that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.879" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">is like money was critical and she and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:25.379" style="s2">art and the other holo chain guys found</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">each other and thinking I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.379" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">how we are today so let&#39;s jump in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:33.569" style="s2">little bit first and talk about hollow</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:36.659" style="s2">chain itself well then later talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.569" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">hollow hollow port hollow fuel the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.659" end="00:02:41.340" style="s2">hollow token etc but let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:43.829" style="s2">the hollow chain itself as I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.340" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">my research one of the analogies that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.829" end="00:02:50.129" style="s2">you all used I found very illuminating</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">which was describing the hollow chain</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.129" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">approach as agent centric rather than</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:02:58.049" style="s2">data centric as compared to say Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:03:01.230" style="s2">and etherium and in particular you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.049" end="00:03:04.109" style="s2">compared hollow chain in ways to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.230" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">could you start with talking about agent</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.109" end="00:03:07.590" style="s2">centric computing and how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">fundamentally different than what</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.590" end="00:03:12.359" style="s2">bitcoin and aetherium are doing sure you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:15.569" style="s2">know the the thing that there is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.359" end="00:03:17.970" style="s2">common is that we use hash chains which</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.569" end="00:03:20.340" style="s2">you know is a cryptographic structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:22.380" style="s2">that can give you essentially some</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:23.880" style="s2">characteristics of immutability where</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.380" end="00:03:24.419" style="s2">you can&#39;t really go back and change the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.880" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.419" end="00:03:29.099" style="s2">once hashes of things that have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:30.810" style="s2">shared right so it kind of locks in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.099" end="00:03:33.419" style="s2">past so there&#39;s kind of a common ground</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.810" end="00:03:37.319" style="s2">but one of the better ways to think of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.419" end="00:03:41.790" style="s2">hollow chain less like blockchain then</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.319" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2">like get plus BitTorrent right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.790" end="00:03:48.269" style="s2">instead of managing consensus of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">blocks have been committed officially to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.269" end="00:03:55.410" style="s2">one ledger every agent has their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">source chain we call it because all data</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.410" end="00:04:00.660" style="s2">is sourced in a source chain and it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">only the data they author their local</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.660" end="00:04:05.459" style="s2">state changes that are written to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:08.010" style="s2">chain and then published to a DHT as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.459" end="00:04:10.139" style="s2">shared ledger global visibility space</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.010" end="00:04:12.060" style="s2">but that&#39;s an eventually consistent</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.139" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">system it&#39;s not a consensus driven</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.060" end="00:04:18.329" style="s2">system so that makes for very different</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:21.060" style="s2">characteristics of performance and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.329" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">would assert it actually models the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.060" end="00:04:25.770" style="s2">the real world works the way we see</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">things work in physics and biology and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.770" end="00:04:28.860" style="s2">some of the naming of things in hollow</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:31.770" style="s2">chain like application code is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.860" end="00:04:34.340" style="s2">DNA you know things like that so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.770" end="00:04:38.280" style="s2">pattern that is inspired by nature that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.340" end="00:04:39.090" style="s2">gives us the scalable coordination ya</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.280" end="00:04:41.370" style="s2">know one things that struck me</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.090" end="00:04:43.139" style="s2">immediately and those have listened to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.370" end="00:04:45.180" style="s2">this show before know that I will rant</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.139" end="00:04:46.830" style="s2">about Bitcoin and how the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.180" end="00:04:49.110" style="s2">it&#39;s doing is accelerating the heat</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.830" end="00:04:50.849" style="s2">death of the universe right you know it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.110" end="00:04:53.430" style="s2">strikes me that as you say most</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.849" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">real-world problems don&#39;t actually need</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.430" end="00:04:57.449" style="s2">to be written to a global ledger right</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:05:00.569" style="s2">that everybody in the world has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.449" end="00:05:01.830" style="s2">duplicate etc you know take a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.569" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">this case it&#39;s even more absurd than</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.830" end="00:05:06.389" style="s2">that it&#39;s essentially saying every</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.759" style="s2">computer program in the world doing you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.389" end="00:05:10.889" style="s2">know class exome application in the case</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.759" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">of etherium smart contracts has to run</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.889" end="00:05:14.460" style="s2">on the same slow computer who in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:16.889" style="s2">world would design a system like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.460" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">right and yet those are two of our more</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.889" end="00:05:21.210" style="s2">popular distributed ledger applications</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:23.130" style="s2">out there and as I dug into hollow che</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.210" end="00:05:26.009" style="s2">and I said this looks like it might</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.130" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">actually scale and be a reasonable fit</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.009" end="00:05:29.880" style="s2">for the real world yeah if I could say a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:32.219" style="s2">little bit more about the agent centric</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.880" end="00:05:34.020" style="s2">aspect I think distributed computing</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.219" end="00:05:36.719" style="s2">gets a little hung up by traditional</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.020" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">computing in terms of we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.719" end="00:05:42.419" style="s2">thinking that we can hold the whole data</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:44.969" style="s2">set the whole data space right and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.419" end="00:05:46.979" style="s2">that space has sort of its own inherent</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.969" end="00:05:49.710" style="s2">truth to it this is the kind of data</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.979" end="00:05:52.259" style="s2">centric mentality and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.710" end="00:05:55.229" style="s2">suggesting is all of that data actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.259" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">came from somewhere whenever it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.229" end="00:06:01.590" style="s2">created it was an assertion by an agent</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:03.449" style="s2">and if you break that from its</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.590" end="00:06:04.199" style="s2">provenance if you break data from where</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.449" end="00:06:06.509" style="s2">it came from</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.199" end="00:06:09.270" style="s2">you actually have already lost data</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.509" end="00:06:11.099" style="s2">integrity you know if you were to ask me</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.270" end="00:06:12.599" style="s2">what the temperature in the room that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.099" end="00:06:14.069" style="s2">I&#39;m sitting in right now is you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.599" end="00:06:16.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a thermostat over on the wall</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.069" end="00:06:18.779" style="s2">that would give you one thing but if I</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.199" end="00:06:20.340" style="s2">had one of those little infrared devices</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.779" end="00:06:22.169" style="s2">and could measure different temperatures</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.340" end="00:06:23.490" style="s2">I&#39;d you know click it over the lamp over</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.169" end="00:06:26.340" style="s2">there that kind of thing I&#39;ve got lots</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.340" end="00:06:30.300" style="s2">wrote those to a database where Arthur</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.900" end="00:06:33.330" style="s2">used this device and I signed them to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.300" end="00:06:36.300" style="s2">database but then we find out tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.330" end="00:06:37.860" style="s2">that that infrared little you know gun</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.300" end="00:06:39.390" style="s2">trigger that I was using to measure the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:42.600" style="s2">temperatures is 20%</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.390" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">calibration now we know which data was</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.600" end="00:06:47.700" style="s2">affected which data is not true when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:50.010" style="s2">just start off assuming that data has</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.700" end="00:06:51.420" style="s2">sort of inherent truth and you break it</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.010" end="00:06:53.640" style="s2">from where it came from</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.420" end="00:06:55.920" style="s2">I&#39;d suggest you you&#39;re starting with</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.640" end="00:06:57.900" style="s2">problems so whole the chain is really</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.920" end="00:07:00.540" style="s2">coming from this agent centric</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.900" end="00:07:04.200" style="s2">perspective that you write data to your</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.540" end="00:07:05.940" style="s2">chain it&#39;s signed and shared and so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.200" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">always know where the data came from it</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.940" end="00:07:11.190" style="s2">can always be verified and validated</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:13.890" style="s2">against that local state and so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.190" end="00:07:16.290" style="s2">just lets us create very different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.890" end="00:07:19.650" style="s2">of patterns of sense-making and social</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.290" end="00:07:21.690" style="s2">coherence that I would say go far beyond</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.650" end="00:07:24.570" style="s2">kind of the current scope of smart</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.690" end="00:07:26.100" style="s2">contracts and such ok so let&#39;s set for</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.570" end="00:07:28.620" style="s2">our audience we&#39;ll break this down into</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.100" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">more bite-sized pieces so when I start</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.620" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">to develop something or start to be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:36.450" style="s2">user of hollow chain I could have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:39.240" style="s2">private key and I write use my private</p>

<p begin="00:07:39.240" end="00:07:43.320" style="s2">chain called the source chain is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.980" end="00:07:46.050" style="s2">correct well not a block chain just have</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.320" end="00:07:48.330" style="s2">chain but yes but I read it looked like</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.050" end="00:07:50.370" style="s2">the math was pretty damn similar right</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.330" end="00:07:52.410" style="s2">but ok let&#39;s call it a hash chain so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.370" end="00:07:53.760" style="s2">say we use the same trick that you sign</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.410" end="00:07:56.070" style="s2">the block including the previous</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.760" end="00:07:57.930" style="s2">signature so it can&#39;t be hacked etc well</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.070" end="00:07:59.820" style="s2">what is it what do you call each thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.930" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">that you write what&#39;s the name of the of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.820" end="00:08:04.230" style="s2">the block that is written to the chain</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:05.940" style="s2">it&#39;s just an entry like an entry in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.230" end="00:08:08.130" style="s2">database or whatever we just call them</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.940" end="00:08:10.710" style="s2">entries okay rather than being a block</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.130" end="00:08:12.330" style="s2">of many and great and of course one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.710" end="00:08:14.550" style="s2">the nice things about that is that you</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.550" end="00:08:18.870" style="s2">have the right to write to your source</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.220" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">deal out of the fact that private data</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.930" end="00:10:22.790" style="s2">by itself isn&#39;t all that interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:25.050" style="s2">once you guys riff on that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.790" end="00:10:27.089" style="s2">sure actually if I could even just touch</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.050" end="00:10:28.110" style="s2">on the intrinsic data integrity aspect</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.089" end="00:10:31.260" style="s2">of what you were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.110" end="00:10:33.720" style="s2">blockchain has been kind of blown up to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.260" end="00:10:35.700" style="s2">be about tokens and about currency but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.720" end="00:10:39.510" style="s2">think what&#39;s interesting is it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.700" end="00:10:41.970" style="s2">anybody being able to hold and serve the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.510" end="00:10:43.980" style="s2">data because the data has intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.970" end="00:10:47.280" style="s2">integrity you can tell that it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.980" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">been tampered with right and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.280" end="00:10:52.620" style="s2">case of what you&#39;re talking about we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:58.020" style="s2">actually have shared sense-making spaces</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.620" end="00:11:00.180" style="s2">and trust each person or anybody on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.020" end="00:11:02.790" style="s2">network to be an authority for the data</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.180" end="00:11:05.459" style="s2">so what I mean by that is like who</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.790" end="00:11:05.939" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t love to be able to log in and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.459" end="00:11:08.549" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.939" end="00:11:10.069" style="s2">bank balance you know say I&#39;ve got 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.549" end="00:11:13.679" style="s2">more dollars today than I did yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.069" end="00:11:17.009" style="s2">well the thing that prevents that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.679" end="00:11:18.539" style="s2">this story is that the you can&#39;t tamper</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.009" end="00:11:20.249" style="s2">with the data the data is tamper proof</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.539" end="00:11:22.199" style="s2">there has to have actually been a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.249" end="00:11:26.099" style="s2">transaction that somebody else signed</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.199" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">for that money to exist right and so all</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.099" end="00:11:32.399" style="s2">state changes are signed by the people</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:34.229" style="s2">whose state is changing so in the case</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.399" end="00:11:36.329" style="s2">of implementing a currency on hollow</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.229" end="00:11:38.999" style="s2">chain which doesn&#39;t have one built in by</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.329" end="00:11:41.220" style="s2">the way like most block chains - we</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.999" end="00:11:43.319" style="s2">recommend you do it basically like</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.220" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">double entry accounting and the two</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.319" end="00:11:49.109" style="s2">agents whose state is changing both</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:50.579" style="s2">signed the same transaction to each of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.109" end="00:11:52.919" style="s2">their chains and they give each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.579" end="00:11:55.399" style="s2">the counter signatures and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.919" end="00:11:58.529" style="s2">local state changing and you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.399" end="00:12:00.869" style="s2">global state or global time to be able</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.529" end="00:12:03.209" style="s2">to make this work well tech will go into</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.869" end="00:12:04.859" style="s2">that application that a particular you</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.209" end="00:12:06.869" style="s2">know small-scale currency applicational</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.859" end="00:12:09.509" style="s2">but later but when we get our data</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.869" end="00:12:10.829" style="s2">written to our local source chain you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.509" end="00:12:12.269" style="s2">know it&#39;s not all that useful sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.829" end="00:12:13.529" style="s2">our own computer probably some things to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.269" end="00:12:16.709" style="s2">be all right maybe I want to do a</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.709" end="00:12:21.209" style="s2">if I want to share it with people and</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.209" end="00:12:24.839" style="s2">work you need to replicate it get that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.069" end="00:12:27.239" style="s2">data out so other people can have access</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.839" end="00:12:29.399" style="s2">to it now of course this is the tricky</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.239" end="00:12:31.019" style="s2">part of distributed computing in you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.399" end="00:12:32.429" style="s2">know Facebook or something all the data</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.019" end="00:12:34.499" style="s2">is written in one place or at least it</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.429" end="00:12:36.389" style="s2">looks like it&#39;s in one place it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.499" end="00:12:39.329" style="s2">to search it&#39;s one big from the user</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.389" end="00:12:42.029" style="s2">perspective bag of searchable data much</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.329" end="00:12:44.869" style="s2">more tricky in distributed land you guys</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.029" end="00:12:47.009" style="s2">have the idea of peer replication and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.869" end="00:12:49.499" style="s2">validation maybe you could describe that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.009" end="00:12:52.859" style="s2">a little bit and how do two peers decide</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.499" end="00:12:57.299" style="s2">to peer with each other so in hollow</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.859" end="00:12:59.999" style="s2">chain each hollow chain application is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.299" end="00:13:01.709" style="s2">separate network if you will it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.999" end="00:13:03.359" style="s2">separate peer-to-peer encrypted network</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.709" end="00:13:06.269" style="s2">and you have to be running the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.359" end="00:13:09.389" style="s2">application to be a peer of others so</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.269" end="00:13:11.549" style="s2">for example if you take a chat app like</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.389" end="00:13:16.439" style="s2">a slack application you want to create a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.549" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">private slack team you could fork in</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.439" end="00:13:20.500" style="s2">existing</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:22.450" style="s2">instance by just changing a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.500" end="00:13:24.730" style="s2">number and they&#39;re changing a UUID and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.450" end="00:13:26.830" style="s2">they&#39;re to make your own little network</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.730" end="00:13:28.540" style="s2">that has its own identity and send</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.830" end="00:13:30.820" style="s2">people an invitation code to join your</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.540" end="00:13:33.180" style="s2">network and they become peers in your</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.820" end="00:13:35.950" style="s2">network by installing that software</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.180" end="00:13:38.920" style="s2">installing that instance of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.950" end="00:13:40.870" style="s2">slack app and then the the one trick</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.920" end="00:13:42.640" style="s2">there is a bootstrapping process for</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.870" end="00:13:44.920" style="s2">four peers to start finding each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.640" end="00:13:47.770" style="s2">so you would need to set give an address</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.920" end="00:13:50.740" style="s2">and right now we&#39;re stuck using kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.770" end="00:13:53.200" style="s2">the centralized domain name resolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.740" end="00:13:55.660" style="s2">type process for addresses just because</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.200" end="00:13:58.570" style="s2">it&#39;s universal so that&#39;s kind of the one</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.660" end="00:14:00.730" style="s2">little legacy part of centralization</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.570" end="00:14:04.990" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s in holo chain is that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.730" end="00:14:07.570" style="s2">have to bootstrap somewhere and then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.990" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">peers just gossip with each other to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.570" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">manage the sharing of that information</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:14.410" style="s2">of those of the slack chats for example</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:18.250" style="s2">or other Twitter and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.410" end="00:14:20.550" style="s2">and so much of the internet now is you</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.250" end="00:14:23.560" style="s2">know web 2.0 it&#39;s data that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.550" end="00:14:26.500" style="s2">contributed by the users and yet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.560" end="00:14:28.690" style="s2">all given to some central corporation</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.500" end="00:14:30.670" style="s2">when there could be ways that we could</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.690" end="00:14:33.490" style="s2">just hold these things ourselves without</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.670" end="00:14:35.650" style="s2">needing to basically have a surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.490" end="00:14:37.630" style="s2">corporation in the middle that&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.650" end="00:14:39.970" style="s2">money off of selling your data to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.630" end="00:14:41.530" style="s2">advertisers and we know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.970" end="00:14:43.240" style="s2">interest particularly in our game be</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.530" end="00:14:45.400" style="s2">world of getting away from these</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.240" end="00:14:47.830" style="s2">centralized data controllers and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.400" end="00:14:50.140" style="s2">exploiters of users right as we say if</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.830" end="00:14:52.510" style="s2">you&#39;re not paying for their service and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.140" end="00:14:53.950" style="s2">there you are the product right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.510" end="00:14:56.020" style="s2">you&#39;re basically retentions being</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.950" end="00:14:57.820" style="s2">hijacked in various pernicious ways and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.020" end="00:15:00.370" style="s2">if we had control of our own data would</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.820" end="00:15:02.580" style="s2">get away from that so to make it clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.370" end="00:15:05.050" style="s2">what peering really means is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.580" end="00:15:07.540" style="s2">multiple people two or more people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.050" end="00:15:10.090" style="s2">using the exact same app which means</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.540" end="00:15:13.420" style="s2">that the app itself is signed right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.090" end="00:15:16.060" style="s2">owned by a private key or an address is</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.420" end="00:15:18.670" style="s2">that approximately correct yeah the app</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.060" end="00:15:21.700" style="s2">code is actually signed into the first</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.670" end="00:15:23.350" style="s2">entry of each person&#39;s source chain so</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.700" end="00:15:26.290" style="s2">if that source chain doesn&#39;t start with</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.350" end="00:15:28.030" style="s2">the same hash then you&#39;re not running</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.290" end="00:15:30.370" style="s2">the same code you know you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.030" end="00:15:31.550" style="s2">the same rules it&#39;s because of the peer</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.370" end="00:15:33.650" style="s2">validation you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.550" end="00:15:35.750" style="s2">we actually have to be able to check</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.650" end="00:15:37.340" style="s2">each other&#39;s work and that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.750" end="00:15:38.870" style="s2">reliable which means we have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.340" end="00:15:41.090" style="s2">same rules for checking each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.870" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">work right and so that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.090" end="00:15:45.650" style="s2">very first entry of everybody&#39;s chain so</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.420" style="s2">you can check that hash and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.650" end="00:15:49.730" style="s2">we&#39;re all on the same rules it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.420" end="00:15:51.470" style="s2">part of the network encryption salt so</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.730" end="00:15:53.920" style="s2">that you&#39;re not even talking with</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.470" end="00:15:56.930" style="s2">somebody that doesn&#39;t have that hash and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.920" end="00:15:59.210" style="s2">isn&#39;t in that encrypted network now one</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.930" end="00:16:01.430" style="s2">objection I have read about that is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.210" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">means that every time you do even the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.430" end="00:16:05.930" style="s2">most rudimentary bug fix on an app you</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:07.760" style="s2">essentially have to have everybody you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:10.220" style="s2">know fully reinstall the app and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.760" end="00:16:12.680" style="s2">in some real sense it&#39;s a different app</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.220" end="00:16:15.320" style="s2">how do you respond to that objection to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.680" end="00:16:18.260" style="s2">this architecture I would say that is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.320" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">real phenomenon of distributed software</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.260" end="00:16:23.750" style="s2">that objection comes from a centralized</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:25.970" style="s2">software viewpoint where everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.750" end="00:16:27.380" style="s2">to go to one Authority and that one</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.970" end="00:16:28.490" style="s2">authority is managing everything and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.380" end="00:16:31.070" style="s2">therefore you can just change it in one</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.490" end="00:16:33.140" style="s2">place nice and simple right but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.070" end="00:16:35.630" style="s2">distributed software then the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.140" end="00:16:37.640" style="s2">running it have to receive a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.630" end="00:16:39.860" style="s2">distribution of the new version right</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.640" end="00:16:42.470" style="s2">and be able to move to that new version</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.860" end="00:16:45.560" style="s2">part of what we encourage in hollow</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.470" end="00:16:48.350" style="s2">chain to reduce the pain of this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.560" end="00:16:52.040" style="s2">first of all not making huge monolithic</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.350" end="00:16:54.610" style="s2">applications but instead building small</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.040" end="00:16:57.140" style="s2">micro services that work together and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.610" end="00:16:59.840" style="s2">have pretty reliable narrow</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.140" end="00:17:02.900" style="s2">functionality and you keep in the DNA</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.840" end="00:17:04.580" style="s2">you keep the only the data integrity</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.900" end="00:17:06.950" style="s2">management the data validation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.580" end="00:17:09.170" style="s2">integrity management rules and all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.950" end="00:17:11.570" style="s2">your UI stuff should be outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.170" end="00:17:12.709" style="s2">DNA and you can change that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.570" end="00:17:15.050" style="s2">people can be using different versions</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.709" end="00:17:17.330" style="s2">of UIs and that&#39;s fine they&#39;ll still</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.050" end="00:17:19.400" style="s2">have the same peer validation for</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.330" end="00:17:20.810" style="s2">checking each other&#39;s work that brings</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.400" end="00:17:24.920" style="s2">up a very interesting question let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.810" end="00:17:27.830" style="s2">it is a distributed slack channel if the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.920" end="00:17:29.330" style="s2">app changes ie the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.830" end="00:17:31.310" style="s2">signature on the app changes for let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.330" end="00:17:34.130" style="s2">say even a fairly rudimentary bug fix</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.310" end="00:17:37.160" style="s2">does the data have to be replicated as</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.130" end="00:17:39.890" style="s2">well or are the data and the data and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.160" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">the app some set separate on my machine</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.890" end="00:17:43.580" style="s2">I suppose I have two years worth of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:45.450" style="s2">slack data for our 50-person</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.580" end="00:17:47.100" style="s2">project could be a lot of day</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.450" end="00:17:48.540" style="s2">when the new version of the app comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.100" end="00:17:51.480" style="s2">out there&#39;s all I have data after we</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.540" end="00:17:54.510" style="s2">replicated - it&#39;s a great question so it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.480" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">really depends on which type of app it</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.510" end="00:17:58.650" style="s2">is you&#39;re talking about and what you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:01.320" style="s2">do with with whole a chain the apps</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.650" end="00:18:03.470" style="s2">being micro services are small and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.320" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">lightweight and you can be running</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.470" end="00:18:08.610" style="s2">multiple versions of an app if need be</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">so one of the things that we do to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.610" end="00:18:13.890" style="s2">address the simplifying that the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:15.750" style="s2">the pain of having to have everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.890" end="00:18:18.510" style="s2">migrate from one version to another is</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.750" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">that we have this sort of concept of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.510" end="00:18:23.880" style="s2">closing entries and opening entries on</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:26.460" style="s2">your chain where you can say okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.880" end="00:18:30.510" style="s2">closing down working on this version and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.460" end="00:18:33.000" style="s2">have migrated to this new DNA and in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.510" end="00:18:35.850" style="s2">in that new DNA after your first entries</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.000" end="00:18:37.680" style="s2">where you put in your the DNA code and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.850" end="00:18:39.960" style="s2">your agent key then you can have an</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.680" end="00:18:43.470" style="s2">opening entry that says I just came from</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.960" end="00:18:46.280" style="s2">this other DNA hash and that way you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.470" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">actually have queries that span across</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.280" end="00:18:51.930" style="s2">DNA versions and across dhts</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:55.020" style="s2">where you can be running them both or</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.930" end="00:18:57.210" style="s2">running multiples and be querying into</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.020" end="00:18:59.400" style="s2">your history across multiple versions</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.210" end="00:19:01.320" style="s2">and so that we can try to try to provide</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.400" end="00:19:03.510" style="s2">it&#39;s both an experience as possible</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.320" end="00:19:05.640" style="s2">there I can see that&#39;s gonna be a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.510" end="00:19:07.290" style="s2">tricky from a application development</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.640" end="00:19:11.070" style="s2">perspective in fact I interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.290" end="00:19:12.990" style="s2">Stephen levy a couple days ago recently</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.070" end="00:19:14.760" style="s2">wrote a great book about face book right</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.990" end="00:19:17.490" style="s2">and one of the things we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.760" end="00:19:19.380" style="s2">one of Facebook&#39;s competitive advantages</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.490" end="00:19:22.230" style="s2">was it was one of the first major online</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.380" end="00:19:24.360" style="s2">companies to be essentially built with</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.230" end="00:19:26.400" style="s2">DevOps in from the very beginning so</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.360" end="00:19:28.920" style="s2">that they were pushing four or five new</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:31.590" style="s2">updates to the face book software every</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.920" end="00:19:33.690" style="s2">day and we know of course now Google</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.590" end="00:19:35.160" style="s2">nobody sees this the same Google</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.690" end="00:19:37.590" style="s2">everybody gets a different Google</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.160" end="00:19:39.510" style="s2">because they&#39;re testing hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.590" end="00:19:42.630" style="s2">different parameters on the user</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.510" end="00:19:46.530" style="s2">interface every day and it strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.630" end="00:19:48.600" style="s2">that that hyper agile devops driven you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.530" end="00:19:51.780" style="s2">know user experience driven way to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.600" end="00:19:53.790" style="s2">evolve software incremental II would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.780" end="00:19:55.890" style="s2">impossible to do in this environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.790" end="00:19:57.930" style="s2">well except as you said most of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.890" end="00:19:58.740" style="s2">changes are to the experience to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.930" end="00:20:01.170" style="s2">user interface</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.740" end="00:20:02.340" style="s2">not to the underlying data integrity so</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.170" end="00:20:04.920" style="s2">it&#39;s only when you&#39;re changing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.340" end="00:20:08.100" style="s2">underlying data models data structures</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.920" end="00:20:10.679" style="s2">or the permissions and and such that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.100" end="00:20:12.020" style="s2">would that would affect validation that</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.679" end="00:20:14.670" style="s2">you would actually be changing the DNA</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.020" end="00:20:18.570" style="s2">you could have many many different</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.670" end="00:20:20.550" style="s2">versions of UI is running and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.570" end="00:20:23.100" style="s2">part of the beauty of it is you could</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.550" end="00:20:24.630" style="s2">allow again it&#39;s sort of agent centric</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.100" end="00:20:27.030" style="s2">perspective on this where I could</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.630" end="00:20:30.510" style="s2">customize my own op you I run my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.030" end="00:20:32.730" style="s2">skins or pull different data from</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.510" end="00:20:35.640" style="s2">different applications into a single UI</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.730" end="00:20:39.390" style="s2">that don&#39;t provide that kind of unified</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.640" end="00:20:41.550" style="s2">interface and because what matters from</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.390" end="00:20:44.160" style="s2">the DNA perspective is that no state</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.550" end="00:20:47.130" style="s2">change is happening that is invalid</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.160" end="00:20:50.010" style="s2">but you can collect that data and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.130" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">display it however you would like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.010" end="00:20:53.160" style="s2">though in the case of Google in</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:56.100" style="s2">particular Facebook as well there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.160" end="00:20:58.650" style="s2">of a deep marriage between the data and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.100" end="00:21:01.710" style="s2">machine learning algorithms which decide</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.650" end="00:21:03.870" style="s2">how its presented and from the UI layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.710" end="00:21:06.600" style="s2">those those two things kind of live</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.870" end="00:21:09.090" style="s2">together and it&#39;s the machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.600" end="00:21:12.630" style="s2">layer that&#39;s evolving probably even</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.090" end="00:21:13.710" style="s2">faster than the formal UI exactly but</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.630" end="00:21:17.670" style="s2">you would put that machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.710" end="00:21:19.380" style="s2">layer for the UI outside of the DNA it</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.670" end="00:21:21.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change the structure of the data</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.380" end="00:21:24.090" style="s2">necessarily it just will filter which</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.990" end="00:21:26.490" style="s2">data like rank which pages come in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.090" end="00:21:28.440" style="s2">search or which posts in your feed and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.490" end="00:21:30.360" style="s2">that kind of thing and this is again the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.440" end="00:21:32.250" style="s2">beauty of I could use one algorithm and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.360" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">you could use another to display your</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.250" end="00:21:36.210" style="s2">feed and we can each get what we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:38.010" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.210" end="00:21:41.490" style="s2">we&#39;re right now on Facebook we get what</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.010" end="00:21:44.220" style="s2">fits advertisers won exactly I call it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.490" end="00:21:46.290" style="s2">the zuc algorithm and I hate it right if</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.220" end="00:21:48.929" style="s2">you can actually pull that off in a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.290" end="00:21:50.910" style="s2">that really works for real developers of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.929" end="00:21:53.160" style="s2">application then this may well be the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.910" end="00:21:55.110" style="s2">right platform to replace Facebook with</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.160" end="00:21:57.960" style="s2">at some point let&#39;s go down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.110" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">into the weeds a tad as I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.960" end="00:22:03.140" style="s2">for my relatively modest readings the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:06.200" style="s2">actual applications are created out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.140" end="00:22:08.429" style="s2">components called zomes which are</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.200" end="00:22:10.740" style="s2">lower-level components which are then</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.429" end="00:22:12.659" style="s2">packaged in a way that are you know not</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.740" end="00:22:14.669" style="s2">that different from micro-services</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.659" end="00:22:16.499" style="s2">dnase because you talk just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.669" end="00:22:19.409" style="s2">about the distinction between those two</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.499" end="00:22:22.109" style="s2">and why you chose to do it that way</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.409" end="00:22:25.559" style="s2">yeah Soames was just kind of our silly</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.109" end="00:22:28.470" style="s2">word for modules based on chromosomes in</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.559" end="00:22:30.299" style="s2">DNA right like what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.470" end="00:22:32.609" style="s2">subsections well how might you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.299" end="00:22:33.929" style="s2">modularized your code because generally</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.609" end="00:22:36.059" style="s2">speaking people want to create good</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.929" end="00:22:38.940" style="s2">modularity for sharing and maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.059" end="00:22:42.239" style="s2">code and reusing portions of things and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.940" end="00:22:45.299" style="s2">so the idea is as oh maybe a module or</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.239" end="00:22:47.190" style="s2">reusable portion that you might use in</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.299" end="00:22:50.369" style="s2">different places so for example there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.190" end="00:22:52.169" style="s2">a anchors pattern that you use a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.369" end="00:22:55.769" style="s2">hollow chain where you sort of use a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.169" end="00:22:58.409" style="s2">predictable bit of content to hash let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.769" end="00:23:01.349" style="s2">say it&#39;s a username you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.409" end="00:23:03.749" style="s2">you can use that hash to attach a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.349" end="00:23:05.639" style="s2">links to find other things so if it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.749" end="00:23:07.349" style="s2">a Twitter app it could be a your Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.639" end="00:23:11.309" style="s2">user handle write your Twitter handle</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.349" end="00:23:14.700" style="s2">and then from that handle I can find</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.309" end="00:23:16.590" style="s2">links to your posts to your tweets right</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.700" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">or to your followers or to who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.590" end="00:23:22.409" style="s2">following or your favorites or you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:23.700" style="s2">things like that and that handle holds a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.409" end="00:23:26.789" style="s2">lot of things together well there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.700" end="00:23:29.190" style="s2">anchors API and anchors mix in that a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.789" end="00:23:31.109" style="s2">lot of applications use and they just</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.190" end="00:23:33.539" style="s2">that&#39;s a zone that they can just plug in</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.109" end="00:23:35.879" style="s2">and use this pattern for generating</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.539" end="00:23:37.559" style="s2">anchors that also create kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.879" end="00:23:39.450" style="s2">little directory system and way of kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.559" end="00:23:43.229" style="s2">of having data be more discoverable</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.450" end="00:23:45.539" style="s2">because on a DHT data is tricky to find</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.229" end="00:23:47.700" style="s2">sometimes if you don&#39;t know the hash</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.539" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">right how do you go look for it when</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.700" end="00:23:50.840" style="s2">it&#39;s spread across potentially thousands</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:52.950" style="s2">or hundreds of thousands of computers</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.840" end="00:23:54.989" style="s2">yep we&#39;ll talk about that and I can have</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.950" end="00:23:56.940" style="s2">a whole section on that go in the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.989" end="00:24:00.210" style="s2">level so so think of we can think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.940" end="00:24:02.190" style="s2">zones as modules and DNA as the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.210" end="00:24:04.139" style="s2">equivalent of small programs is that a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.190" end="00:24:06.119" style="s2">fair enough way to describe them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.139" end="00:24:08.639" style="s2">okay and then the next level up I</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.119" end="00:24:12.869" style="s2">believe you call a chaps as a bundle of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.639" end="00:24:16.229" style="s2">a client which talks to one or more</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.869" end="00:24:18.539" style="s2">DNA&#39;s using a lightweight RPC is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.229" end="00:24:22.289" style="s2">approximately correct yeah a half is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.539" end="00:24:24.179" style="s2">way of bundling DNA&#39;s and UI&#39;s into</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.289" end="00:24:25.970" style="s2">something that basically can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.179" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">delivered to an end user there</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.970" end="00:24:30.050" style="s2">maybe a single UI there may be multiple</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:32.360" style="s2">you eyes there may be multiple DNA&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.050" end="00:24:34.780" style="s2">it provides and integrated a singular</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.360" end="00:24:37.370" style="s2">experience by bundling it all together</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.780" end="00:24:40.970" style="s2">and as we know and a lot of real-world</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.370" end="00:24:43.340" style="s2">problems building that UI is not easy do</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.970" end="00:24:45.740" style="s2">you guys have decent tools for building</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.340" end="00:24:47.690" style="s2">you eyes at this point we have had a few</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.740" end="00:24:50.150" style="s2">different iterations of tools and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.690" end="00:24:52.520" style="s2">actually very excited about one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.150" end="00:24:54.740" style="s2">newest ones that&#39;s coming out of one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.520" end="00:24:57.860" style="s2">our guys Philip in Australia who has</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.740" end="00:25:00.770" style="s2">been building a bunch of components in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.860" end="00:25:05.540" style="s2">view using the view JavaScript framework</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.770" end="00:25:10.010" style="s2">and he&#39;s been building a hollow chain</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.540" end="00:25:11.960" style="s2">app designer that is a hula chain app so</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.010" end="00:25:14.780" style="s2">hollow chain sent essentially replaces</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.960" end="00:25:19.000" style="s2">github in this way where you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.780" end="00:25:20.840" style="s2">actually use it to manage and share</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.000" end="00:25:22.280" style="s2">designing information while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.840" end="00:25:24.290" style="s2">building an app with other people</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.280" end="00:25:26.810" style="s2">building the app and then there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.290" end="00:25:29.570" style="s2">mode he&#39;s calling a chimera mode which</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.810" end="00:25:31.340" style="s2">you know is like a mashed up animal if</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.570" end="00:25:33.380" style="s2">you will part lion part snake part</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.340" end="00:25:35.390" style="s2">whatever right so it&#39;s kind of a mash up</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.380" end="00:25:38.660" style="s2">mode where you can pull different DNA&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.390" end="00:25:41.180" style="s2">together and he&#39;s defined slots where</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.660" end="00:25:43.190" style="s2">you can have the UI components the web</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.180" end="00:25:44.930" style="s2">components that from one you I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.190" end="00:25:48.110" style="s2">populate into another one and you start</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.930" end="00:25:51.530" style="s2">having this kind of pluggable component</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.110" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">tree for UI components for whole chain</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.530" end="00:25:54.980" style="s2">apps and hopefully we&#39;ll be be</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:56.630" style="s2">publishing this in the next couple of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.980" end="00:25:59.000" style="s2">weeks because I think it&#39;ll be a fun</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.630" end="00:26:00.980" style="s2">thing for people to play with and those</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.000" end="00:26:02.690" style="s2">things matter I can tell you as a you</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.980" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">know my business career I did various</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.690" end="00:26:08.300" style="s2">things I was an entrepreneur I was a you</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:09.830" style="s2">know sole entrepreneur startup venture</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.300" end="00:26:12.190" style="s2">dude all that&#39;s up then I was also a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.830" end="00:26:16.100" style="s2">corporate CTO for a number of years and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.190" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">one of things I saw in the 90s is sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.100" end="00:26:21.050" style="s2">of the Microsoft if occation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:24.620" style="s2">corporate American software was driven</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.050" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">by one thing visual basic oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.620" end="00:26:30.890" style="s2">right because it was easy right and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:33.800" style="s2">you know worked off that and build a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.890" end="00:26:36.350" style="s2">whole you know Visual Studio etc etc and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.800" end="00:26:39.049" style="s2">so I would not at all underestimate the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.350" end="00:26:41.690" style="s2">criticality to your ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.049" end="00:26:44.179" style="s2">having tools that are easy indeed even</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.690" end="00:26:46.039" style="s2">pleasant to use to be able to build you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.179" end="00:26:47.419" style="s2">know the whole stack out and I hope you</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.039" end="00:26:49.999" style="s2">guys are paying enough attention to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.419" end="00:26:53.059" style="s2">could my experience a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.999" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">this space aren&#39;t yeah to me what</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.059" end="00:26:56.450" style="s2">Phillip has built is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:59.480" style="s2">breakthrough for us in it we actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.450" end="00:27:01.970" style="s2">did have a scaffolding kind of a quick</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.480" end="00:27:04.179" style="s2">start thing that would almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.970" end="00:27:07.070" style="s2">wizard help you build your app kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.179" end="00:27:09.649" style="s2">thing where you would identify your</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.070" end="00:27:11.539" style="s2">zomes and some entries and create entry</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.649" end="00:27:13.249" style="s2">schemas for you using JSON schema and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.539" end="00:27:15.739" style="s2">all that kind stuff in the old version</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.249" end="00:27:19.779" style="s2">and it would generate tests and a basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.739" end="00:27:24.350" style="s2">testing UI ugly but basic testing UI and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.779" end="00:27:27.080" style="s2">also your basic crud functions for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.350" end="00:27:29.090" style="s2">data you still needed to go in and do</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.080" end="00:27:30.379" style="s2">more with the peer validation rules and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.090" end="00:27:32.809" style="s2">everything but in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.379" end="00:27:36.169" style="s2">bootstrapping somebody up quickly it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.809" end="00:27:38.539" style="s2">a really helpful tool and this one was</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.169" end="00:27:40.970" style="s2">supposed to be kind of the successor to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.539" end="00:27:44.389" style="s2">that and Phillip went a little crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.970" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">just started getting into you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.389" end="00:27:49.100" style="s2">mixing and matching all the visual</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:52.340" style="s2">components as well and I&#39;m really hoping</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.100" end="00:27:53.539" style="s2">that it does create some buzz and stir</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.340" end="00:27:56.659" style="s2">because it&#39;s the kind of thing where</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.539" end="00:27:58.850" style="s2">power users can start assembling apps</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.659" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">and combining pieces of apps into new</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.850" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">things and that kind of thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.359" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be a power developer you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">can really kind of be a power user that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.359" end="00:28:09.830" style="s2">can pace things together and I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:12.440" style="s2">assert that much of the web emerged that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.830" end="00:28:13.940" style="s2">way from kind of people pasting together</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.440" end="00:28:16.609" style="s2">stuff that they found on other websites</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.940" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">and liking that pattern and assembling</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.609" end="00:28:20.509" style="s2">it together right that&#39;s kind of how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:21.529" style="s2">got to where we got to on the the web</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.509" end="00:28:23.869" style="s2">altogether</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.529" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">yeah I used to make that point that even</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.869" end="00:28:28.609" style="s2">though from my perspective as a you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:31.220" style="s2">former database designer a network</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.609" end="00:28:33.950" style="s2">protocol aware dude you know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.220" end="00:28:36.019" style="s2">imagine anything sleazier than HTTP and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.950" end="00:28:38.299" style="s2">HTML all right holy who&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.019" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">build a world on that but the reason it</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.299" end="00:28:41.960" style="s2">happened was you could tell your</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:44.869" style="s2">secretary to go view source and steal</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.960" end="00:28:47.450" style="s2">the source from an early 1993 web page</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.869" end="00:28:50.899" style="s2">and duplicate it in 15 minutes right</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.450" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">that&#39;s why HTML HTTP took over the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.899" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">despite the fact that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:56.110" style="s2">abomination</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:57.280" style="s2">right it was easy it was viral I guess</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.110" end="00:28:59.500" style="s2">though I suppose we&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.280" end="00:29:02.650" style="s2">say viral anymore in this time of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.500" end="00:29:04.060" style="s2">pandemic and so yeah those ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.650" end="00:29:05.740" style="s2">things make all the difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.060" end="00:29:07.450" style="s2">world you know it led us to this</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.740" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">horrible thing called the web which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.450" end="00:29:11.590" style="s2">now not so horrible anymore but frankly</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:14.020" style="s2">despite its foundations not because of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.590" end="00:29:16.750" style="s2">them what I&#39;m hoping that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.020" end="00:29:20.350" style="s2">accomplishes is actually understanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.750" end="00:29:22.360" style="s2">that hollow chain apps can be very small</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.350" end="00:29:25.300" style="s2">in scope they can just be your your</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.360" end="00:29:27.010" style="s2">family&#39;s check-in system or you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.300" end="00:29:30.910" style="s2">something with a small group of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.010" end="00:29:33.550" style="s2">where blockchain apps tend to be viewed</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.910" end="00:29:35.020" style="s2">with much greater sort of weight and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.550" end="00:29:37.210" style="s2">significance because you&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.020" end="00:29:38.830" style="s2">writing something in stone forever on a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.210" end="00:29:41.470" style="s2">monolithic blockchain if you make a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.830" end="00:29:43.390" style="s2">mistake in your smart contract you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.470" end="00:29:45.820" style="s2">it can be horrifying and have real</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.390" end="00:29:48.580" style="s2">financial consequences in terms of gas</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.820" end="00:29:50.890" style="s2">costs or credits lost or you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.580" end="00:29:53.410" style="s2">different things like that and part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.890" end="00:29:56.530" style="s2">what I&#39;m hoping can come out of a tool</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.410" end="00:29:59.020" style="s2">set like this is losing a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.530" end="00:30:01.660" style="s2">that stigma and fear and significance to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.020" end="00:30:04.690" style="s2">just say oh I can just invite people to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.660" end="00:30:07.750" style="s2">play in little spaces and the the risk</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.690" end="00:30:10.780" style="s2">factor in that is extremely low it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.750" end="00:30:13.690" style="s2">just sand boxes we can play in yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.780" end="00:30:16.090" style="s2">I can revoke the program if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.690" end="00:30:17.620" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s you with your key</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.090" end="00:30:19.780" style="s2">management system I can just like kill</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.620" end="00:30:21.910" style="s2">that sucker right yeah let&#39;s move on to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.780" end="00:30:23.800" style="s2">the next part and frankly as a database</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.910" end="00:30:26.140" style="s2">nerd the part thing I found most</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.800" end="00:30:27.910" style="s2">interesting I&#39;m not sure everybody will</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.140" end="00:30:30.430" style="s2">but I thought it was really cool and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.910" end="00:30:32.830" style="s2">that really really serious innovation is</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.430" end="00:30:33.940" style="s2">your distributed hash table and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.830" end="00:30:35.500" style="s2">particularly some of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.940" end="00:30:36.910" style="s2">ways that you made that tolerably</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.500" end="00:30:39.340" style="s2">efficient such as basically making</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.910" end="00:30:42.520" style="s2">everything a hash including usernames</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.340" end="00:30:44.410" style="s2">and sorting basically assigning content</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.520" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">to the agents name who&#39;s closest to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.410" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">hash on the content etc could you lay</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:51.550" style="s2">out for the audience what is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:54.220" style="s2">distributed hash table and why is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.550" end="00:30:56.410" style="s2">interesting and innovative so the just</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.220" end="00:30:58.690" style="s2">starting with the real basics a hash is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.410" end="00:31:00.610" style="s2">kind of like a fingerprint for data and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.690" end="00:31:02.920" style="s2">if the data changes the fingerprint</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.610" end="00:31:05.639" style="s2">should change significantly a hash table</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.920" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">is kind of a way of organized</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.639" end="00:31:10.829" style="s2">that in a key-value store where the hash</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:13.320" style="s2">has a kind of key that you can look up</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.829" end="00:31:14.519" style="s2">the the values you&#39;re looking for you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.320" end="00:31:16.849" style="s2">can retrieve the values you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.519" end="00:31:19.619" style="s2">for in a table a distributed hash table</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.849" end="00:31:21.359" style="s2">divides that across many many different</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.619" end="00:31:22.619" style="s2">machines so that nobody needs to hold</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.359" end="00:31:24.839" style="s2">the whole thing so it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.619" end="00:31:29.159" style="s2">breaking a kind of database into many</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.839" end="00:31:32.309" style="s2">little parts and then when we do that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.159" end="00:31:35.539" style="s2">can also create have agents or users</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.309" end="00:31:39.059" style="s2">have addresses in the same address space</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.539" end="00:31:42.690" style="s2">that the data is stored in so now we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.059" end="00:31:44.999" style="s2">we can arrange the data we can send it</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.690" end="00:31:47.070" style="s2">to hosts whose address is near the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.999" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">address of the data and so whenever</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.070" end="00:31:51.059" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for data you just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:53.190" style="s2">get routed toward the hosts with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.059" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">closest addresses or the peers with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.190" end="00:31:58.109" style="s2">closest addresses and get back the data</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:31:59.909" style="s2">that you&#39;re looking for and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.109" end="00:32:02.639" style="s2">set up some redundancy levels and we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.909" end="00:32:04.979" style="s2">set up gossip and and things for being</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.639" end="00:32:07.049" style="s2">able to have peers that are near each</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.979" end="00:32:08.579" style="s2">other know about the data that each</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.579" end="00:32:13.859" style="s2">kind of a self-healing database as peers</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.139" end="00:32:20.519" style="s2">broadly and as new peers join they learn</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.519" end="00:32:25.549" style="s2">get that gossip to them and so it lets</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.219" end="00:32:28.169" style="s2">us have kind of an organic living</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.549" end="00:32:30.119" style="s2">self-healing database which is I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.169" end="00:32:33.719" style="s2">what we have to have in these sort of</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.750" end="00:33:39.340" style="s2">trying to do is manage how many copies</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.550" end="00:33:40.630" style="s2">are online at any time meaning when</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.340" end="00:33:43.150" style="s2">peers are gossiping with each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.630" end="00:33:45.790" style="s2">they&#39;re keeping a little log of my</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.030" end="00:33:55.060" style="s2">have an uptime estimate for you right</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.360" end="00:33:57.670" style="s2">and then I know that if the target data</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.060" end="00:33:59.710" style="s2">a target number here is a hundred but my</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.670" end="00:34:02.980" style="s2">peers are really only have twenty-five</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.710" end="00:34:04.690" style="s2">percent uptime right then basically I</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.980" end="00:34:08.320" style="s2">need to have four hundred copies of the</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.970" end="00:34:13.419" style="s2">of decision often when they say a</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.419" end="00:34:17.770" style="s2">have four hundred nodes trying to gossip</p>

<p begin="00:34:17.770" end="00:34:24.340" style="s2">down and what we&#39;re kind of finding is</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:28.300" style="s2">that we may want to have the default be</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.340" end="00:34:32.050" style="s2">a kind of autopilot mode where the let</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.300" end="00:34:33.970" style="s2">the network balance itself and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.050" end="00:34:37.120" style="s2">that there&#39;s adequate redundancy and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.970" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">adequate load handling rather than have</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.120" end="00:34:42.040" style="s2">sort of a preconceived notion of a</p>

<p begin="00:34:42.040" end="00:34:46.840" style="s2">factor be able to provide that for now</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.919" end="00:34:49.300" style="s2">we still have that single number as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.840" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">target but I think we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.300" end="00:34:53.169" style="s2">tuning this more kind of like auto tune</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:55.690" style="s2">mode where we can have applications</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.169" end="00:34:57.900" style="s2">default to auto tune and only override</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.690" end="00:35:00.820" style="s2">that in in kind of exception cases</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.900" end="00:35:03.070" style="s2">that&#39;s probably very wise again to help</p>

<p begin="00:35:26.620" end="00:35:29.560" style="s2">going to get to you later but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.670" end="00:35:30.370" style="s2">mentioned the gossip protocol that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.560" end="00:35:32.710" style="s2">guys use</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.370" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">time&#39;s gossip protocols are a class of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.710" end="00:35:35.980" style="s2">protocols there&#39;s lots of gossip</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:37.660" style="s2">protocols it might be useful for our</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.980" end="00:35:39.850" style="s2">audience who probably have never heard</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.660" end="00:35:41.860" style="s2">the term before it to explain what a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.850" end="00:35:43.150" style="s2">gossip protocol is and maybe at least a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.860" end="00:35:46.150" style="s2">little bit what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.150" end="00:35:49.380" style="s2">specifics of your protocol cool</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.150" end="00:35:51.970" style="s2">the basic gist you know gossip is</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.380" end="00:35:53.560" style="s2">referring to the same kind of activity</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.970" end="00:35:55.480" style="s2">that we as humans do it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.560" end="00:35:58.570" style="s2">hey what&#39;s new what&#39;s the news that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.480" end="00:36:02.230" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard and so in a gossip protocol</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.570" end="00:36:05.290" style="s2">on whole chain you connect to other</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.230" end="00:36:07.060" style="s2">peers and you may have things to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.290" end="00:36:09.040" style="s2">to them that you&#39;re intending to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.060" end="00:36:10.990" style="s2">to them like saying hey you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.040" end="00:36:13.840" style="s2">about this but then you&#39;re also asking</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.990" end="00:36:18.190" style="s2">them hey what have you heard about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.840" end="00:36:20.110" style="s2">I should know and in hollow chains DHT</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.190" end="00:36:24.250" style="s2">representation we&#39;re able to have a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.110" end="00:36:26.740" style="s2">simple representation of what data a</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.250" end="00:36:29.950" style="s2">node is holding there&#39;s their address</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.740" end="00:36:32.620" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another integer which</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.950" end="00:36:35.170" style="s2">is basically the the range beyond their</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.620" end="00:36:37.930" style="s2">address that they&#39;re holding so it</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.170" end="00:36:39.460" style="s2">allows nodes with higher capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.930" end="00:36:41.740" style="s2">hold more and nodes that are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.460" end="00:36:43.720" style="s2">smaller capacity running on a Raspberry</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.740" end="00:36:46.210" style="s2">Pi with very little storage attached or</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.720" end="00:36:48.370" style="s2">something to hold less but we have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.210" end="00:36:51.730" style="s2">simple way of knowing what range you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.370" end="00:36:55.210" style="s2">accountable for of addresses in the in</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.730" end="00:36:57.340" style="s2">the DHT and so we can say for my range</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.210" end="00:36:59.170" style="s2">given these two numbers you know about</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.340" end="00:37:01.360" style="s2">me know about my address because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.170" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">the literally the address I&#39;m contacting</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.360" end="00:37:06.790" style="s2">you from my message is signed by it it</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:09.100" style="s2">comes from that address and all you need</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.790" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">is this one other number to know whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.100" end="00:37:11.560" style="s2">or not any of the stuff that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:13.810" style="s2">holding are new things you&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.560" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">about are in my range that you should</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.810" end="00:37:18.610" style="s2">tell me about I hope that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:20.680" style="s2">is the crux of the of the gossip</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.610" end="00:37:22.900" style="s2">protocol and then nodes are just doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.680" end="00:37:25.450" style="s2">this on a periodic basis depending on</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.900" end="00:37:28.480" style="s2">how frequent they&#39;re seeing new data and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.450" end="00:37:31.000" style="s2">the like less active applications can</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:32.530" style="s2">calm the gossip a little bit because the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.000" end="00:37:34.870" style="s2">changes aren&#39;t happening very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.530" end="00:37:36.820" style="s2">and and very active applications are</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.870" end="00:37:39.160" style="s2">gonna have faster gap gossip because</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.820" end="00:37:40.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of changes happen and can</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.160" end="00:37:42.619" style="s2">you specify that at the application</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.930" end="00:37:45.950" style="s2">level essentially</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.619" end="00:37:48.049" style="s2">at the moment what we&#39;re doing is again</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.950" end="00:37:50.479" style="s2">more we&#39;re trying to get more into this</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.049" end="00:37:55.069" style="s2">auto tuning and more like exponential</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.479" end="00:37:56.930" style="s2">back-off s-- where if i haven&#39;t gotten</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.069" end="00:37:58.910" style="s2">anything new from you then i wait a</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.930" end="00:38:01.009" style="s2">little bit longer and i wait a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.910" end="00:38:02.539" style="s2">bit longer in it you know and then if i</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.009" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">start getting new things from you then</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.539" end="00:38:06.170" style="s2">that kind of pulls me back into a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:08.630" style="s2">active mode and then we kind of back off</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.170" end="00:38:10.670" style="s2">and calm a little bit so that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.630" end="00:38:13.339" style="s2">more built in to the system auto</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.670" end="00:38:15.559" style="s2">behavior at this point okay let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.339" end="00:38:19.130" style="s2">on to the next topic one of my favorites</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.559" end="00:38:20.839" style="s2">which is hashes by definition are</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.130" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">cryptic links they provide no</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.839" end="00:38:25.099" style="s2">information at all about the data right</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:28.910" style="s2">because if they did they wouldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.099" end="00:38:32.289" style="s2">hash however in an information system we</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.910" end="00:38:35.479" style="s2">often want to be able to query on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.289" end="00:38:37.460" style="s2">content right and at first I said oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.479" end="00:38:39.410" style="s2">damn another one of these stupid</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.460" end="00:38:41.180" style="s2">databases of cryptic links that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.410" end="00:38:42.799" style="s2">damn useless but then I dug a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.180" end="00:38:44.299" style="s2">further into your materials and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.799" end="00:38:47.150" style="s2">realize that you&#39;ve extended the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.299" end="00:38:49.609" style="s2">concepts some towards a graph database</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.150" end="00:38:52.069" style="s2">with what you guys call tags and anchors</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.609" end="00:38:55.249" style="s2">that make at least feasible in principle</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.069" end="00:38:58.400" style="s2">to allow some traversal of the graph</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.249" end="00:39:00.319" style="s2">that has some content specificity to it</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.400" end="00:39:03.589" style="s2">and of course this is a famously</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.319" end="00:39:05.059" style="s2">difficult problem right I&#39;ll just stop</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.589" end="00:39:08.119" style="s2">there actually let you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.059" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">about how you make this graph of cryptic</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.119" end="00:39:12.829" style="s2">links into something that&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:14.900" style="s2">somewhat searchable yeah as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.829" end="00:39:18.920" style="s2">earlier it can be very hard you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.900" end="00:39:21.140" style="s2">expect to crawl a DHT because by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.920" end="00:39:23.059" style="s2">time you even got around to people that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.140" end="00:39:25.279" style="s2">you knew existed other people might</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.059" end="00:39:27.170" style="s2">exist and other data would exist and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.279" end="00:39:28.849" style="s2">there&#39;s not really a good way it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.170" end="00:39:31.729" style="s2">inherently kind of an invention a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.849" end="00:39:34.819" style="s2">consistent space what you want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.729" end="00:39:38.839" style="s2">build good ways of finding the data</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.819" end="00:39:40.999" style="s2">through references so those references</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.839" end="00:39:42.170" style="s2">can be in the form of links where those</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.999" end="00:39:44.719" style="s2">references can be in the form of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.170" end="00:39:46.910" style="s2">indexes or those references also can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.719" end="00:39:47.779" style="s2">in the form of chains meaning we already</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.910" end="00:39:50.329" style="s2">have one</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.779" end="00:39:52.789" style="s2">topology that every piece of data that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.329" end="00:39:53.780" style="s2">got added at the DHT was in somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.789" end="00:39:56.510" style="s2">source chain</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.780" end="00:39:59.060" style="s2">so I could find from one of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.510" end="00:40:02.060" style="s2">neighbors I could request kind of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.060" end="00:40:05.240" style="s2">header history if you were offline and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.060" end="00:40:07.970" style="s2">basically be able to re-crawl your</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.240" end="00:40:10.910" style="s2">activity your set of state changes</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.970" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">that&#39;s one way that we can find data on</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.910" end="00:40:17.030" style="s2">it right if I have your key or address I</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:19.130" style="s2">could talk to neighbors of yours and say</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.030" end="00:40:21.830" style="s2">hey give me give me this header history</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.130" end="00:40:24.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s really useful for things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.830" end="00:40:27.620" style="s2">matter in a chronological context things</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.500" end="00:40:29.960" style="s2">like monetary transactions right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.620" end="00:40:31.910" style="s2">whether you your current balance is</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.960" end="00:40:34.100" style="s2">based on the chain of your past actions</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.910" end="00:40:37.460" style="s2">which funds you&#39;ve received and which</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.100" end="00:40:41.390" style="s2">funds you&#39;ve sent spent right and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.460" end="00:40:43.970" style="s2">that topology already exists but what</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.390" end="00:40:46.370" style="s2">we&#39;ve done like you said with links is</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.970" end="00:40:49.490" style="s2">be able to attach links on to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.370" end="00:40:51.230" style="s2">essentially anything else and query them</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.490" end="00:40:53.660" style="s2">as meta information and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.230" end="00:40:56.630" style="s2">this pattern of anchors which is a way</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.660" end="00:40:58.220" style="s2">of giving links a good base to attach to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.630" end="00:41:00.500" style="s2">that&#39;s predictable and known like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.220" end="00:41:03.650" style="s2">username or or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.500" end="00:41:06.590" style="s2">then we even have created the anchors in</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.650" end="00:41:08.510" style="s2">a sort of tree hierarchy so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.590" end="00:41:10.580" style="s2">think of that like a browsable directory</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.510" end="00:41:12.410" style="s2">file structure if you will where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.580" end="00:41:14.510" style="s2">a root anchor that tells you what anchor</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.410" end="00:41:16.190" style="s2">types exist and those anchor types tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.510" end="00:41:18.710" style="s2">you which anchors exist so if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.190" end="00:41:21.740" style="s2">user anchor type you could go get the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.710" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">list of user names off of the user root</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.740" end="00:41:27.470" style="s2">anchor you know and so get it creates</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:29.750" style="s2">ways of having the space be discoverable</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.470" end="00:41:32.110" style="s2">and crawlable and still be distributed</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.750" end="00:41:35.180" style="s2">yep indexing is a whole other problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.110" end="00:41:38.210" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good first step however as</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.180" end="00:41:41.030" style="s2">we know there&#39;s a big tension between</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.210" end="00:41:42.830" style="s2">browsing and searching and the way I</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.030" end="00:41:45.170" style="s2">would describe it is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.830" end="00:41:47.720" style="s2">problem with browsing is that it puts a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.170" end="00:41:50.570" style="s2">burden on somebody to manage a taxonomy</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.720" end="00:41:52.850" style="s2">right and if we remember the early days</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.570" end="00:41:55.670" style="s2">of the internet Yahoo was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.850" end="00:41:57.620" style="s2">taxonomy you browsed Yahoo you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.670" end="00:41:59.690" style="s2">search it in the old days you went down</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.620" end="00:42:02.120" style="s2">these damn menus layer after layer and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.690" end="00:42:03.740" style="s2">then other people Lykos might have been</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.120" end="00:42:06.200" style="s2">the first one that was an actual search</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.740" end="00:42:07.670" style="s2">engine I&#39;m not quite sure but anyway you</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.200" end="00:42:10.339" style="s2">can actually do full-text searching so</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.670" end="00:42:12.470" style="s2">is the indexing issue and you know to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.339" end="00:42:14.569" style="s2">bring it back to a tangible example our</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.470" end="00:42:16.609" style="s2">old friend Facebook love it and hate it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.569" end="00:42:18.290" style="s2">you go up to the Facebook search box and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.609" end="00:42:20.270" style="s2">you type in almost anything and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.290" end="00:42:21.890" style="s2">surprisingly off and it&#39;ll give you what</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.270" end="00:42:23.569" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.890" end="00:42:26.420" style="s2">do indexing how do you do something like</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.569" end="00:42:28.430" style="s2">search on a distributed hash table I</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.420" end="00:42:30.349" style="s2">think there&#39;s gonna end up being a</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.430" end="00:42:33.530" style="s2">number of different indexing strategies</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.349" end="00:42:35.809" style="s2">but one of the ones that we were using</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.530" end="00:42:37.430" style="s2">and the go version of holo chain and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.809" end="00:42:39.319" style="s2">apps that we built there I think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.430" end="00:42:41.720" style="s2">carrying over in this rust version which</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.319" end="00:42:45.349" style="s2">is basically that there&#39;s an indexing</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.720" end="00:42:48.819" style="s2">app another hole a chain app but that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.349" end="00:42:51.640" style="s2">it&#39;s only being run by nodes that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.819" end="00:42:54.290" style="s2">more substantial nodes that are online</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.640" end="00:42:56.119" style="s2">reliably that have storage space and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.290" end="00:42:58.280" style="s2">processing power you can think of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.119" end="00:43:00.500" style="s2">as servers because we want</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.280" end="00:43:02.420" style="s2">generally-speaking whole chain apps to</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.500" end="00:43:04.940" style="s2">be lightweight enough for you to just</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.420" end="00:43:08.180" style="s2">run them on your phone and from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.940" end="00:43:11.059" style="s2">graphing perspective we can keep that in</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.180" end="00:43:12.740" style="s2">scope and not put too heavy load on</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.059" end="00:43:15.319" style="s2">somebody&#39;s phone or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.740" end="00:43:17.150" style="s2">but if you start running indexing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.319" end="00:43:19.190" style="s2">this is a peer-to-peer app that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.150" end="00:43:20.750" style="s2">everybody&#39;s running now you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.190" end="00:43:22.549" style="s2">back into the sort of blockchain problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.750" end="00:43:24.650" style="s2">of everybody holding everything right</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.549" end="00:43:26.290" style="s2">and holding an index to everything or at</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.650" end="00:43:30.230" style="s2">least holding an index anything right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.290" end="00:43:32.559" style="s2">because holo chain DNA&#39;s can role chain</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.230" end="00:43:36.380" style="s2">apps can bridge to each other locally</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.559" end="00:43:38.750" style="s2">what we can do is you can build your</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.380" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">Twitter app kind of thing but now you</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.750" end="00:43:43.220" style="s2">want those tweets to be indexed you want</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:45.470" style="s2">to be able to search on you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.220" end="00:43:48.140" style="s2">emerging terms and that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.470" end="00:43:50.510" style="s2">well then you can have some nodes be</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.140" end="00:43:52.609" style="s2">indexed nodes we can get into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.510" end="00:43:55.130" style="s2">incentives for running an index node in</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.609" end="00:43:59.059" style="s2">a minute but the way that that works is</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.130" end="00:44:01.010" style="s2">the index node runs the Twitter app our</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.059" end="00:44:04.339" style="s2">case it was called clutter and they also</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.010" end="00:44:06.980" style="s2">run the clutter index app and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.339" end="00:44:10.250" style="s2">register themselves in the clutter app</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.980" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">as an index node and then everybody when</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.250" end="00:44:15.770" style="s2">they posts posts to one index node and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">the index nodes gossip with each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.770" end="00:44:20.420" style="s2">because it&#39;s a whole chain app that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:21.500" style="s2">gossiping right and you can do queries</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.420" end="00:44:24.500" style="s2">by sending</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.500" end="00:44:26.600" style="s2">a direct message to an index node and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.500" end="00:44:28.550" style="s2">get back a set of results and then just</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.600" end="00:44:31.400" style="s2">query your Twitter app your clutter app</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.550" end="00:44:33.260" style="s2">Pierce for the actual things that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.400" end="00:44:35.180" style="s2">know the results you need to load but</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.260" end="00:44:37.670" style="s2">you get the results list back from one</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.180" end="00:44:40.750" style="s2">of the indexes and we built that index</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.670" end="00:44:43.850" style="s2">pattern using anchors just using</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.750" end="00:44:46.250" style="s2">keywords as anchors that then have links</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.850" end="00:44:48.770" style="s2">that went off to the posts that included</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.250" end="00:44:50.660" style="s2">those words and you know so everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.770" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">that we used in that pattern we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.660" end="00:44:54.620" style="s2">already kind of described on this call</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:57.020" style="s2">but that&#39;s going to have a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.620" end="00:44:59.540" style="s2">of performance that whole kind of index</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.020" end="00:45:02.390" style="s2">everything as a base word as an anchor</p>

<p begin="00:45:02.390" end="00:45:07.010" style="s2">there&#39;s not any reason that you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.920" end="00:45:09.860" style="s2">have these notes actually just plug in</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.010" end="00:45:11.390" style="s2">something that&#39;s doing meta searches on</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.860" end="00:45:14.020" style="s2">the data like plug in actual</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.390" end="00:45:16.520" style="s2">elasticsearch or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.020" end="00:45:19.340" style="s2">have something outside of hole a chain</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.520" end="00:45:21.710" style="s2">be running the indexing on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.340" end="00:45:23.300" style="s2">chain entries VM sort of essentially</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.710" end="00:45:25.910" style="s2">have the idea of an external service</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.300" end="00:45:28.820" style="s2">maybe something like that yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.910" end="00:45:30.710" style="s2">this is agent centric you as an agent</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.820" end="00:45:33.530" style="s2">can connect things in to your data</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.710" end="00:45:36.770" style="s2">locally right and if you are an index</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.530" end="00:45:38.330" style="s2">node then you have all the data that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.770" end="00:45:40.660" style="s2">needs to be indexed and you can be</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.330" end="00:45:44.630" style="s2">indexing that locally and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.660" end="00:45:45.860" style="s2">respond to queries using that algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.630" end="00:45:47.320" style="s2">you know that kind of thing so you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.860" end="00:45:50.570" style="s2">do things outside of hollow chain</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.320" end="00:45:51.500" style="s2">locally that&#39;s like that&#39;s like the like</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.570" end="00:45:53.990" style="s2">you were talking about the machine</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.500" end="00:45:55.970" style="s2">learning for prioritizing results that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.990" end="00:45:57.830" style="s2">kind of stuff this is a similar sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.970" end="00:46:00.740" style="s2">thing so of course you wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.830" end="00:46:03.050" style="s2">every user to be re-indexing you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.740" end="00:46:05.570" style="s2">all a Facebook or even my view into</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.050" end="00:46:08.030" style="s2">Facebook and that&#39;s the big advantage</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.570" end="00:46:11.690" style="s2">that centralized systems have they only</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.030" end="00:46:13.520" style="s2">index it once but for resilience if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.690" end="00:46:15.530" style="s2">want a decentralized system you probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.520" end="00:46:18.020" style="s2">want decentralized indexes where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.530" end="00:46:21.500" style="s2">might have 20 or 200 or you know some</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.020" end="00:46:23.960" style="s2">number of nodes that are each</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.500" end="00:46:25.610" style="s2">independently indexing this and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.960" end="00:46:28.100" style="s2">you&#39;re not relying on only one</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.610" end="00:46:29.750" style="s2">organization now the question is for</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.100" end="00:46:32.330" style="s2">that higher workload what&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.750" end="00:46:35.210" style="s2">incentive to do so well sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.330" end="00:46:38.750" style="s2">data is the incentive right because</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.210" end="00:46:40.339" style="s2">the view into the data and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.750" end="00:46:42.470" style="s2">be able to see patterns in the data and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.339" end="00:46:43.849" style="s2">they and it&#39;s the idea that they would</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.470" end="00:46:45.710" style="s2">be willing to run a server and I have</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.849" end="00:46:47.349" style="s2">everybody notify them when they</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.710" end="00:46:50.119" style="s2">published new data into whole a chain</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.349" end="00:46:52.190" style="s2">would be an incentive in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.119" end="00:46:54.550" style="s2">right if I want to run I don&#39;t know an</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.190" end="00:46:56.780" style="s2">index server for a ride-sharing</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.550" end="00:46:59.329" style="s2">application because I&#39;m a municipality</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.780" end="00:47:02.180" style="s2">and I want to see what the ride-sharing</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.329" end="00:47:03.980" style="s2">needs are what they indicate about where</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.180" end="00:47:06.109" style="s2">we might need transit routes or things</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.980" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">like that right like I having that data</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.109" end="00:47:11.030" style="s2">for us to do analysis on could actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">be useful I would have that data if I</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.030" end="00:47:15.349" style="s2">ran an index node if you need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">people because you don&#39;t have useful</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.349" end="00:47:20.180" style="s2">data data that is that nobody knows they</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:21.980" style="s2">use for which not sure if that exists</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.180" end="00:47:23.720" style="s2">but you know then you could create other</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.980" end="00:47:26.380" style="s2">incentives you could run it on mykola</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.720" end="00:47:30.980" style="s2">hosting and actually have people host</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.380" end="00:47:32.690" style="s2">hosts get paid to run index nodes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.980" end="00:47:34.730" style="s2">assume that for instance someone wants</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.690" end="00:47:36.170" style="s2">to build a competitor to Facebook or</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.730" end="00:47:37.910" style="s2">Twitter for their community but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.170" end="00:47:38.869" style="s2">concerned about privacy&#39;s they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.910" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">think they don&#39;t want to and send</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.869" end="00:47:43.490" style="s2">somebody to mine the data - in return</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:46.130" style="s2">for providing search so was it the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.490" end="00:47:49.160" style="s2">application builder who creates the link</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.130" end="00:47:51.380" style="s2">to the concept of search servers it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.160" end="00:47:53.030" style="s2">okay you know how we had those different</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.380" end="00:47:54.859" style="s2">zones or we had different micro service</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.030" end="00:47:56.510" style="s2">DNA&#39;s the outright the application</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.859" end="00:48:01.190" style="s2">builder can build just a little stub of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.510" end="00:48:03.950" style="s2">a zone that knows how to call into the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.190" end="00:48:05.450" style="s2">other DNA right to make send those</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.950" end="00:48:09.020" style="s2">direct messages back and forth to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.450" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">index nodes and that lets you split the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.020" end="00:48:12.740" style="s2">work between nodes that are carrying the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">heavy or indexing load and no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.740" end="00:48:16.940" style="s2">similar kind of thing not just for</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:19.510" style="s2">indexing if you wanted to run YouTube on</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.940" end="00:48:22.280" style="s2">polar chain you probably want to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.510" end="00:48:24.650" style="s2">nodes that are actually serving out</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.280" end="00:48:27.049" style="s2">video streaming video and nodes that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.650" end="00:48:30.290" style="s2">want to be viewing or maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.049" end="00:48:31.940" style="s2">sometimes posting video from a phone but</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.290" end="00:48:33.650" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to be serving video from</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.940" end="00:48:35.420" style="s2">their phone right now definitely so</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.650" end="00:48:37.339" style="s2">similar kind of thing for a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.420" end="00:48:40.460" style="s2">reason where you want to have break it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.339" end="00:48:41.930" style="s2">out into two classes of nodes that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.460" end="00:48:44.210" style="s2">providing different levels of service</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.930" end="00:48:45.740" style="s2">and you do that by breaking it into two</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.210" end="00:48:46.650" style="s2">DNA is that know how to talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.740" end="00:48:48.690" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.650" end="00:48:50.069" style="s2">okay oh that&#39;s healthy guys we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.690" end="00:48:51.690" style="s2">lot of thinking and you know we know</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.069" end="00:48:53.579" style="s2">these are the hard problems and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.690" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">distributed computing some you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.579" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">clearly thinking about it and we will</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:49:01.650" style="s2">see how it goes you know I have I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:03.299" style="s2">I mentioned this originally to Fernanda</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.650" end="00:49:05.730" style="s2">that I&#39;ve actually allocated in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.299" end="00:49:08.849" style="s2">schedule June and July of this year to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.730" end="00:49:10.859" style="s2">write a whole a chain app oh yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.849" end="00:49:13.829" style="s2">thought myself rust last year in</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.859" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">November as my new language of the year</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.829" end="00:49:17.369" style="s2">every year I teach myself a new computer</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:19.499" style="s2">language got up to the point where I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.369" end="00:49:22.289" style="s2">could write a bit more than hello world</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.499" end="00:49:24.150" style="s2">in rust and have allocated on my</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.289" end="00:49:26.460" style="s2">calendar June and July to knock out a</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.150" end="00:49:28.140" style="s2">hollow chain app just for fun so I will</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.460" end="00:49:30.089" style="s2">explore some of these issues I&#39;m sure I</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.140" end="00:49:31.890" style="s2">won&#39;t but go quite as far as all this</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.089" end="00:49:34.170" style="s2">but these are the kinds of things that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.890" end="00:49:37.109" style="s2">am interested in when I am in accessing</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.170" end="00:49:39.960" style="s2">a you know infrastructure ecosystem for</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.109" end="00:49:41.400" style="s2">what it could really do nice then though</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.960" end="00:49:43.710" style="s2">I&#39;ll probably write it up as a medium</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.400" end="00:49:45.150" style="s2">post which should be interesting we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.710" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">getting late here we&#39;ve hadn&#39;t had so</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.150" end="00:49:50.730" style="s2">much fun talking I was gonna go into</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:52.950" style="s2">validation in a major way it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.730" end="00:49:54.359" style="s2">important concept in whole chain as far</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.950" end="00:49:55.980" style="s2">as I&#39;ve been able to ascertain in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.359" end="00:49:58.259" style="s2">readings but could you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.980" end="00:49:59.640" style="s2">about validation and how it really works</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.259" end="00:50:01.619" style="s2">it seems like it&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.640" end="00:50:04.529" style="s2">central in how one thinks about</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.619" end="00:50:06.210" style="s2">designing an app yeah it really is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.529" end="00:50:09.349" style="s2">funny validation is a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.210" end="00:50:12.269" style="s2">Bugaboo in an apps people right because</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.349" end="00:50:14.249" style="s2">often when they&#39;re in the early learning</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.269" end="00:50:16.650" style="s2">curve all they&#39;re trying to do is just</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.249" end="00:50:18.900" style="s2">make something happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.650" end="00:50:20.670" style="s2">right like commit the data and read it</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.900" end="00:50:22.769" style="s2">back again and have other people find it</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.670" end="00:50:24.749" style="s2">and woohoo it&#39;s working right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.769" end="00:50:26.849" style="s2">sending tweets around and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.749" end="00:50:29.759" style="s2">things I loved to show while</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.849" end="00:50:33.059" style="s2">demonstrating the like the clutter app</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.759" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">was we get to the validation rules and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.059" end="00:50:36.690" style="s2">validation really is the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:39.630" style="s2">matter this is where peer-to-peer data</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.690" end="00:50:43.619" style="s2">integrity lives right and I would show</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.630" end="00:50:44.970" style="s2">them how the Edit rule on a tweet would</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.619" end="00:50:48.450" style="s2">check to make sure that you were the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.970" end="00:50:51.210" style="s2">author of the tweet right and so it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.450" end="00:50:53.999" style="s2">would compare if I go to edit this tweet</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.210" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">or if I&#39;ve submitted an edit to a tweet</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.999" end="00:50:57.960" style="s2">out there to the DHT and other nodes are</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:51:00.390" style="s2">validating this they&#39;re first checking</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.960" end="00:51:03.210" style="s2">to see am i the author of that tweet</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.390" end="00:51:05.160" style="s2">and if I&#39;m not then then it doesn&#39;t pass</p>

<p begin="00:51:05.160" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">that tweet only the author can update</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.599" end="00:51:10.769" style="s2">their own tweet right but then I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:15.329" style="s2">go to the next section which was delete</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.769" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">a tweet and it just had returned true so</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.329" end="00:51:21.089" style="s2">it turns out we weren&#39;t validating who</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">was deleting tweets in that app it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.089" end="00:51:24.180" style="s2">just anybody could delete anybody&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.180" end="00:51:30.450" style="s2">anybody&#39;s - incorrect and so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.349" end="00:51:32.789" style="s2">kind of the thing that creeps in is you</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.450" end="00:51:34.260" style="s2">start off by just sort of throwing a</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.789" end="00:51:36.210" style="s2">return true and the validation rules</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.260" end="00:51:38.430" style="s2">because you just want to see something</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.210" end="00:51:40.440" style="s2">happen you know and then sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.430" end="00:51:42.510" style="s2">people don&#39;t get around to putting in</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.440" end="00:51:44.910" style="s2">all the right kind of permissions or</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.510" end="00:51:46.650" style="s2">enforcement in the validation and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.910" end="00:51:48.450" style="s2">actually in the tools that that Philips</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.650" end="00:51:50.730" style="s2">been working on the crispys calling it</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.450" end="00:51:56.789" style="s2">CRISPR which because it&#39;s for slicing</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.730" end="00:51:58.920" style="s2">and dicing whole chain DNA&#39;s we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.789" end="00:52:02.549" style="s2">sort of abstracted basic permissions</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.920" end="00:52:05.190" style="s2">down so that we can do so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.549" end="00:52:07.200" style="s2">plug-in with a roles module and you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.190" end="00:52:08.670" style="s2">you can actually create some different</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.200" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">to find some different roles and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.670" end="00:52:11.910" style="s2">put permissions in there and we&#39;ll even</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:14.069" style="s2">fill out some of those things for you so</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.910" end="00:52:16.740" style="s2">that you can constrain something to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.069" end="00:52:18.779" style="s2">author only or to a an admin group or to</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.740" end="00:52:21.900" style="s2">other roles that you might create in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.779" end="00:52:23.730" style="s2">system so we are trying to help people</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.900" end="00:52:25.380" style="s2">even generate their validation rules</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.730" end="00:52:27.960" style="s2">because permissions is certainly one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.380" end="00:52:30.710" style="s2">it but also business logic you know like</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.960" end="00:52:33.180" style="s2">do you have the credits you&#39;re spending</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.710" end="00:52:35.369" style="s2">we can&#39;t help you automate that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.180" end="00:52:37.019" style="s2">gonna have to do the logic of of summing</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.369" end="00:52:38.700" style="s2">the old transactions and seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.019" end="00:52:41.670" style="s2">your current look the current balance is</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.700" end="00:52:43.440" style="s2">for example yeah at some point</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.670" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">presumably like every ecosystem there</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.440" end="00:52:48.180" style="s2">will be modules to do that for you right</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:49.950" style="s2">think about the Python ecosystem the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.180" end="00:52:52.140" style="s2">reason pipe the Python ecosystem I use</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.950" end="00:52:53.640" style="s2">it for our surprisingly I&#39;m a large</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.140" end="00:52:55.740" style="s2">amount of stuff not because I</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.640" end="00:52:57.539" style="s2">particularly love the Python language so</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.740" end="00:52:59.700" style="s2">I think it&#39;s okay but because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.539" end="00:53:01.950" style="s2">bazillion modules available don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.700" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">almost anything and I think that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.950" end="00:53:07.049" style="s2">be real important if your ecosystem is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:08.910" style="s2">gonna take off is to find reusable code</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.049" end="00:53:10.529" style="s2">that people can bootstrap up to high</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.910" end="00:53:11.720" style="s2">levels of functionality without having</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.529" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">to write too much stuff themselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.720" end="00:53:15.150" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:16.109" style="s2">it&#39;s very important I got a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.150" end="00:53:17.250" style="s2">other little things here but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.109" end="00:53:20.519" style="s2">get to the bigger picture stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.250" end="00:53:21.900" style="s2">before I do that one critique in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.519" end="00:53:24.569" style="s2">think I actually dinged you guys on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.900" end="00:53:26.670" style="s2">podcast back in October I&#39;d stumbled</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.569" end="00:53:29.099" style="s2">across hollow chain last year maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.670" end="00:53:30.839" style="s2">August somebody said hey check out whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.099" end="00:53:32.730" style="s2">chain it looks interesting you&#39;d like it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.839" end="00:53:35.400" style="s2">I did I said wow this is interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.730" end="00:53:38.789" style="s2">then I reached out to to my experts on</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.400" end="00:53:41.430" style="s2">blockchain related things distributed</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.789" end="00:53:43.769" style="s2">computing more generally and both of</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.430" end="00:53:45.480" style="s2">them said the same thing which was damn</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.769" end="00:53:47.160" style="s2">said a good ideas but I think they</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.480" end="00:53:49.529" style="s2">killed themselves when they switched</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.160" end="00:53:52.109" style="s2">from their go platform for their rust</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.529" end="00:53:54.119" style="s2">platform they lost too much time lost</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.109" end="00:53:56.220" style="s2">too much the velocity the world&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.119" end="00:53:58.470" style="s2">pass and by how would you respond to</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.220" end="00:54:00.329" style="s2">that now eight months later they may</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.470" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">have even gotten that information from</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.329" end="00:54:04.740" style="s2">one of my own blog posts where I</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:07.619" style="s2">questioned whether we really screwed</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.740" end="00:54:10.460" style="s2">that up because we our prototype version</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.619" end="00:54:13.829" style="s2">of hollow chain and go was surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.460" end="00:54:16.859" style="s2">functional and mature liked it it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.829" end="00:54:18.450" style="s2">built with hardened security from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.859" end="00:54:20.069" style="s2">outset so we didn&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.450" end="00:54:22.170" style="s2">encourage people to run kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.069" end="00:54:24.539" style="s2">enterprise level stuff on it we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.170" end="00:54:27.660" style="s2">downplayed its readiness but meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.539" end="00:54:30.089" style="s2">it worked really well and when we went</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.660" end="00:54:32.759" style="s2">to re-implement and rust there were a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.089" end="00:54:36.630" style="s2">lot of hurdles rust as a very strict</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.759" end="00:54:37.950" style="s2">language and we were sort of willing to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.630" end="00:54:40.049" style="s2">bite the bullet on that because the idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.950" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">is we wanted to make something more</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.049" end="00:54:44.309" style="s2">hardened and strict and that we could</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:46.109" style="s2">stand behind the security of and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.309" end="00:54:50.309" style="s2">spending time dealing with that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.109" end="00:54:52.849" style="s2">strictness upfront may save you a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.309" end="00:54:55.319" style="s2">the security pains later from</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.849" end="00:54:58.430" style="s2">introducing whatever memory leaks</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.319" end="00:55:00.420" style="s2">vulnerabilities you know re-entrant code</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.430" end="00:55:03.299" style="s2">different kinds of problems that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.420" end="00:55:07.619" style="s2">especially challenging in distributed</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.299" end="00:55:08.970" style="s2">systems stupid applications and so there</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.619" end="00:55:11.339" style="s2">was that and there&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.970" end="00:55:12.390" style="s2">maturity of rust and the rust ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.339" end="00:55:13.980" style="s2">and the level of tools that were</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.390" end="00:55:16.140" style="s2">available and how they kept changing</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.980" end="00:55:18.990" style="s2">under our own feet as we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.140" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">use them but even worse we tried to use</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.990" end="00:55:23.819" style="s2">wasum or we were using Waze and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:24.810" style="s2">webassembly so we&#39;re compiling rust to</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.819" end="00:55:26.910" style="s2">webassembly or</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.810" end="00:55:29.160" style="s2">would run in webassembly the idea being</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.910" end="00:55:31.260" style="s2">we wanted to be able to make make this</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.160" end="00:55:33.210" style="s2">in to be able to run in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.260" end="00:55:35.360" style="s2">browsers and stuff and really bring the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.210" end="00:55:38.190" style="s2">peer-to-peer web right into browsers and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.360" end="00:55:40.740" style="s2">we were targeting a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.190" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">Mozilla in that as well although that</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.740" end="00:55:46.920" style="s2">hasn&#39;t advanced very very far for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:48.570" style="s2">of reasons but we just had this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.920" end="00:55:50.760" style="s2">like being able to actually run all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.570" end="00:55:52.680" style="s2">chain apps right in your browser and not</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.760" end="00:55:55.860" style="s2">may not need servers at all anymore</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.680" end="00:55:57.930" style="s2">and boom you know we&#39;ve just made it</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.860" end="00:55:59.820" style="s2">super easy and easy to adopt and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.930" end="00:56:02.820" style="s2">completely eliminated that threshold</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.820" end="00:56:04.740" style="s2">that barrier that is like in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.820" end="00:56:09.030" style="s2">getting into blockchain apps and such</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.740" end="00:56:10.500" style="s2">but wasum was a black box had created a</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.030" end="00:56:12.210" style="s2">black box but you couldn&#39;t really like</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.500" end="00:56:14.370" style="s2">debug the problems that were happening</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.210" end="00:56:15.650" style="s2">we had memory management problems we</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.370" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t really even know how to manage</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.650" end="00:56:22.020" style="s2">wasum x&#39; memory effectively we would</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:24.300" style="s2">spawn more instances of Laza me end up</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.020" end="00:56:26.430" style="s2">using a lot more memory than we in</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.300" end="00:56:29.370" style="s2">retrospect now needed to so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.430" end="00:56:33.270" style="s2">learned a lot in this process but it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.370" end="00:56:35.070" style="s2">definitely a huge delay and we</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.270" end="00:56:38.010" style="s2">implemented a bunch of these things I</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.070" end="00:56:40.740" style="s2">think using a pattern that it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.010" end="00:56:42.750" style="s2">of an anti-pattern for holo chain and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.740" end="00:56:46.650" style="s2">that we were experimenting with running</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.750" end="00:56:48.930" style="s2">Redux as our state model in the local</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.650" end="00:56:50.780" style="s2">state system and I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.930" end="00:56:54.930" style="s2">tripped us up in a bunch of ways as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.780" end="00:56:58.680" style="s2">we actually have done a reset to a whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.930" end="00:57:03.600" style="s2">chain state model and things are moving</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.680" end="00:57:05.910" style="s2">much faster clearer and leave I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.600" end="00:57:08.310" style="s2">would expect to see somewhere on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.910" end="00:57:10.200" style="s2">order of magnitude of 10,000 to 100,000</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.310" end="00:57:12.810" style="s2">times performance increase from this</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.200" end="00:57:14.820" style="s2">refactor but I think we lost a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.810" end="00:57:20.040" style="s2">steam we lost a lot of momentum in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.820" end="00:57:22.710" style="s2">process and I do regret now not actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.040" end="00:57:24.980" style="s2">taking the go prototype and building</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.710" end="00:57:28.740" style="s2">more of an ecosystem around it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.980" end="00:57:31.560" style="s2">having instead of it being kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.740" end="00:57:33.420" style="s2">main stream track having it be more like</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.560" end="00:57:35.250" style="s2">a skunkworks track to do the rust</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.420" end="00:57:37.750" style="s2">refactor where we&#39;ve come out with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.250" end="00:57:39.910" style="s2">more hardened version but we</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.750" end="00:57:41.500" style="s2">put all of our attention on that problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.910" end="00:57:46.890" style="s2">was we wanted to build something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.500" end="00:57:49.030" style="s2">required the hardened security and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.890" end="00:57:51.280" style="s2">yeah well keep in mind you guys we</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.030" end="00:57:53.230" style="s2">talked about earlier HTTP HTML there</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.280" end="00:57:54.970" style="s2">were just piles of right terrible</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.230" end="00:57:57.430" style="s2">yeah and that but they somehow managed</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.970" end="00:57:59.730" style="s2">to build a whole Empire so yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.430" end="00:58:02.770" style="s2">guess time will tell whether that was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.730" end="00:58:03.940" style="s2">fatally wrong decision or not yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.770" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">know do you feel now that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.940" end="00:58:08.410" style="s2">reasonable for developers to you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:11.650" style="s2">start looking at the Polo chain and your</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.410" end="00:58:13.810" style="s2">ecosystem to build real stuff what I do</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.650" end="00:58:17.050" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t actually released the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.810" end="00:58:19.510" style="s2">refactored core yet but it will be</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.050" end="00:58:22.210" style="s2">highly compatible with the existing one</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.510" end="00:58:24.010" style="s2">and and much more performance so but so</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.210" end="00:58:25.960" style="s2">you can write apps now that will not</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.010" end="00:58:28.450" style="s2">need to change much to run on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.960" end="00:58:31.300" style="s2">refactored core so I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.450" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">actually ready for for that and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.300" end="00:58:35.050" style="s2">been putting it through the paces and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:36.849" style="s2">unfortunately that&#39;s also been some of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.050" end="00:58:39.430" style="s2">our delays and launching the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.849" end="00:58:41.320" style="s2">hosting network is really hardening holo</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.430" end="00:58:43.720" style="s2">chain before we can actually run a real</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.320" end="00:58:45.369" style="s2">hosting network on top of it because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.720" end="00:58:47.650" style="s2">know you know there&#39;s these two separate</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.369" end="00:58:50.080" style="s2">projects holo as a hosting network and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.650" end="00:58:53.140" style="s2">holo chain which is a just an</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.080" end="00:58:55.570" style="s2">open-source peer-to-peer dap platform</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.140" end="00:58:57.550" style="s2">essentially and people confuse the two a</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.570" end="00:58:59.170" style="s2">lot because people assume that holo</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.550" end="00:59:01.089" style="s2">chain has a currency for example and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.170" end="00:59:05.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t but the holo hosting network</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.089" end="00:59:07.390" style="s2">does and so yeah people complained the -</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.070" end="00:59:09.849" style="s2">well that&#39;s a perfect transition because</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.390" end="00:59:11.890" style="s2">that&#39;s my next topic on my list as we</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.849" end="00:59:14.050" style="s2">kind of wrap up having talked about holo</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.890" end="00:59:15.940" style="s2">chain and moderate depth ink enough for</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.050" end="00:59:18.460" style="s2">people to get a good sense of what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.940" end="00:59:20.770" style="s2">about let&#39;s go there as I was doing my</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.460" end="00:59:22.900" style="s2">research I discovered okay we have holo</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.770" end="00:59:26.140" style="s2">chain but we also have holo holo Fuels</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.900" end="00:59:28.270" style="s2">holo port etc pop up a level and talk</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.140" end="00:59:30.430" style="s2">about the the ecosystem that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.270" end="00:59:33.550" style="s2">building around holo chain and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.430" end="00:59:36.210" style="s2">various parts and what they do well we</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.550" end="00:59:41.320" style="s2">really had a commitment to try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.210" end="00:59:46.180" style="s2">p2p computing to the mainstream and for</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.320" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">us that means being able to serve people</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.180" end="00:59:51.369" style="s2">right now the way they use the web</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:54.630" style="s2">where they can click on a link or type a</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.369" end="00:59:56.829" style="s2">domain name do a search right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.630" end="00:59:59.979" style="s2">something comes up in their browser and</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.829" end="01:00:01.900" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to know that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.979" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">dealing with sort of next-gen</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.900" end="01:00:08.470" style="s2">distributed tech yet they can dip their</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:11.410" style="s2">toes in the water and use it as a thin</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.470" end="01:00:13.690" style="s2">client where somebody else is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.410" end="01:00:17.109" style="s2">providing the peer hosting for them</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.690" end="01:00:18.789" style="s2">sorry let me back up and just say Holy</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.109" end="01:00:22.299" style="s2">chain doesn&#39;t have a built-in currency</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.789" end="01:00:24.339" style="s2">because we believe that we&#39;ve segmented</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.299" end="01:00:27.190" style="s2">the problem space in a way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.339" end="01:00:28.869" style="s2">only carrying a load you want to carry</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.190" end="01:00:30.789" style="s2">you&#39;re only running an app you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.869" end="01:00:33.489" style="s2">run like this like we were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.789" end="01:00:36.039" style="s2">your your company&#39;s slack app kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.489" end="01:00:37.960" style="s2">thing right well you hosting each</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.039" end="01:00:39.940" style="s2">other&#39;s data for the 50 people in your</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.960" end="01:00:42.339" style="s2">slack team or something like that is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.940" end="01:00:43.989" style="s2">minor load and you&#39;re carrying it</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.339" end="01:00:45.880" style="s2">because you need to communicate with</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.989" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">those people you don&#39;t have to carry a</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.880" end="01:00:50.680" style="s2">huge monolithic blockchain load of every</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:52.359" style="s2">other app in the ecosystem right just</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.680" end="01:00:54.430" style="s2">your own and even that one can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.359" end="01:00:57.579" style="s2">charted and broken up into smaller</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.430" end="01:00:59.529" style="s2">pieces right so we believe we already</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.579" end="01:01:02.469" style="s2">solved kind of that built-in incentive</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.529" end="01:01:03.640" style="s2">problem of people running apps but the</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.469" end="01:01:05.259" style="s2">problem is how do you bring in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.640" end="01:01:07.749" style="s2">mainstream user that isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.259" end="01:01:10.329" style="s2">install some next-gen peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.749" end="01:01:12.009" style="s2">crypto app and that means they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.329" end="01:01:14.200" style="s2">gonna consume it on a web browser which</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.009" end="01:01:15.940" style="s2">means they&#39;re not kind of sharing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.200" end="01:01:17.680" style="s2">load which is the way holo chain is</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.940" end="01:01:20.289" style="s2">built it&#39;s built to share the load among</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:22.119" style="s2">the users and so then that means one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.289" end="01:01:24.640" style="s2">these other users kind of has to take on</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.119" end="01:01:26.979" style="s2">an extra load for the web user and</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.640" end="01:01:28.450" style="s2">that&#39;s where the whole o peer hosting</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.979" end="01:01:31.509" style="s2">network really kind of comes into being</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.450" end="01:01:32.890" style="s2">and why it came into being is a way to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.509" end="01:01:36.130" style="s2">be able to take this stuff really</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.890" end="01:01:37.930" style="s2">mainstream and have the experience be</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.130" end="01:01:41.170" style="s2">like you type in your email and a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.930" end="01:01:44.109" style="s2">password and you think you&#39;re logging in</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.170" end="01:01:46.869" style="s2">you are sort of what you&#39;re really doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.109" end="01:01:48.190" style="s2">is using that to generate keys and</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.869" end="01:01:49.989" style="s2">you&#39;re stepping into a world where</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.190" end="01:01:52.089" style="s2">you&#39;re now managing your own private</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.989" end="01:01:55.390" style="s2">keys and dealing with cryptographic</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.089" end="01:01:57.120" style="s2">applications that are decentralized but</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.390" end="01:02:00.120" style="s2">we&#39;re hiding all of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.120" end="01:02:03.240" style="s2">so that it just gives you the mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.120" end="01:02:05.700" style="s2">experience of using a website got it</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.240" end="01:02:08.220" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s critical for this</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.700" end="01:02:11.550" style="s2">stuff to be able to go mainstream and</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.220" end="01:02:13.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge industry right like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.550" end="01:02:16.020" style="s2">whole cloud hosting industry being able</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.470" end="01:02:18.390" style="s2">to host applications on peer networks</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.020" end="01:02:21.990" style="s2">and not give all your data over to</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.390" end="01:02:25.530" style="s2">Amazon or Google or whoever it is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.990" end="01:02:27.540" style="s2">you know that makes it easy for the NSA</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.530" end="01:02:30.540" style="s2">or whoever needs to come and file a</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.540" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">subpoena to access your data you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.540" end="01:02:34.140" style="s2">link you&#39;re still putting it all in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:35.910" style="s2">centralized places even though</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.140" end="01:02:39.000" style="s2">theoretically you control those virtual</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.910" end="01:02:43.080" style="s2">servers right they&#39;re still under their</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.000" end="01:02:45.660" style="s2">control and this creates a way of</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.080" end="01:02:48.810" style="s2">actually having a resilient framework</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.660" end="01:02:50.940" style="s2">that the community holds itself so let</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.810" end="01:02:52.740" style="s2">me ask a question I think I know the</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.940" end="01:02:55.170" style="s2">answer based on reading the material on</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.740" end="01:02:58.770" style="s2">your websites you described holo as an</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.170" end="01:03:00.930" style="s2">Airbnb for holo chain apps so does that</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.770" end="01:03:03.230" style="s2">mean that holo itself will not actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.930" end="01:03:05.910" style="s2">have servers but it is essentially a</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.230" end="01:03:08.070" style="s2">switching system for other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.910" end="01:03:09.690" style="s2">compute capacity or will you have some</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.070" end="01:03:13.680" style="s2">of your own servers or will it be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.690" end="01:03:15.510" style="s2">hybrid yeah so you know Airbnb sells</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.680" end="01:03:17.010" style="s2">more room nights or did I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.510" end="01:03:18.960" style="s2">what the current status of things are</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.010" end="01:03:20.520" style="s2">during pandemic but you know with</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.960" end="01:03:22.350" style="s2">selling more room nights than the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.520" end="01:03:26.670" style="s2">largest hotel chains but never built a</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.350" end="01:03:28.530" style="s2">hotel we believe that in the dura in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.670" end="01:03:30.690" style="s2">direction that things are going toward</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.530" end="01:03:34.800" style="s2">more distributed daps and that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.690" end="01:03:39.270" style="s2">thing that applications that we could</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.800" end="01:03:40.860" style="s2">host on scale massive infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.270" end="01:03:43.800" style="s2">without ever building a data center</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.860" end="01:03:45.570" style="s2">without by being able to tap into</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.800" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">computing power where it is just like</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.570" end="01:03:50.820" style="s2">Airbnb taps into rooms and homes and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:53.340" style="s2">things where they already are does that</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.820" end="01:03:55.560" style="s2">mean we will have no servers no there</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.340" end="01:03:57.630" style="s2">are some infrastructure parts that are</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.630" end="01:04:03.450" style="s2">hello chain is way completely</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.060" end="01:04:05.040" style="s2">decentralized hollo hosting you still</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.450" end="01:04:07.680" style="s2">have to do things like resolve domain</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.040" end="01:04:11.200" style="s2">names which means there has to be an</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.680" end="01:04:13.180" style="s2">authority for DNS and now we</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.200" end="01:04:16.060" style="s2">we have taken the centralized parts of</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.180" end="01:04:18.220" style="s2">holo and we&#39;re running most of those on</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.060" end="01:04:19.810" style="s2">cloud flares infrastructure through</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.220" end="01:04:22.420" style="s2">their service workers and key value</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.810" end="01:04:25.030" style="s2">stores so even those centralized parts</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.420" end="01:04:28.270" style="s2">are split across thousands of servers on</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.030" end="01:04:30.970" style="s2">on cloud players you know 190 data</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.270" end="01:04:34.839" style="s2">centers and super performance super fast</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.970" end="01:04:37.869" style="s2">because we we want to again give us</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.839" end="01:04:41.410" style="s2">clothes and experience as we can - just</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.869" end="01:04:42.970" style="s2">using a website and so if we can resolve</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.410" end="01:04:46.030" style="s2">the domain name quickly route you to a</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.970" end="01:04:48.040" style="s2">host quickly you know then if that host</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.030" end="01:04:50.020" style="s2">has a slightly slower connection at</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.040" end="01:04:53.260" style="s2">least the process of getting there</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.020" end="01:04:54.849" style="s2">was as fast as we could make it and now</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.260" end="01:04:57.460" style="s2">you&#39;re getting some data served out to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.849" end="01:05:00.099" style="s2">you from a peer host right and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.460" end="01:05:03.119" style="s2">trying to make this as as seamless as</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.099" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">possible to a web browsing experience</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.119" end="01:05:08.500" style="s2">okay let me just ask a scenario I happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:10.810" style="s2">to have a couple of surprisingly fast</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.500" end="01:05:12.579" style="s2">surprisingly cheap servers I bought off</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.810" end="01:05:16.089" style="s2">eBay one time I think they got eight</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.579" end="01:05:18.040" style="s2">processors each and four cores each it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.089" end="01:05:20.589" style="s2">kind of crazy what they&#39;ll do for a few</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.040" end="01:05:23.170" style="s2">hundred bucks could I somehow put that</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.589" end="01:05:26.050" style="s2">compute pool to work without having to</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.170" end="01:05:28.119" style="s2">worry about anything much and get paid</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.050" end="01:05:30.430" style="s2">for running my machines and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.119" end="01:05:32.020" style="s2">presumably running holo chain apps on</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.430" end="01:05:34.930" style="s2">that infrastructure how would that work</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.020" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s where the currency comes</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.930" end="01:05:39.310" style="s2">in that I mentioned earlier is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:42.310" style="s2">there is an accounting system</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.310" end="01:05:44.770" style="s2">essentially for that host power so how</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.310" end="01:05:47.619" style="s2">that works is yes you can run that on</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.770" end="01:05:49.540" style="s2">your machines we also sold little</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.619" end="01:05:51.730" style="s2">devices that look a little bit like Mac</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.540" end="01:05:53.109" style="s2">minis you know they&#39;re small devices you</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.730" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">can put on a shelf and plug into your</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.109" end="01:05:57.579" style="s2">internet router and run these hosts</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:05:59.050" style="s2">these things from home the idea there</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.579" end="01:06:01.839" style="s2">was it&#39;s kind of a plug-and-play system</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.050" end="01:06:04.210" style="s2">you have to put it comes with a USB</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.839" end="01:06:08.430" style="s2">Drive you plug in you go to a website</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.210" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">and basically configure your keys and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.430" end="01:06:12.369" style="s2">that all happens locally we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:13.839" style="s2">anything about your keys but you go to</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.369" end="01:06:16.210" style="s2">the website to pull down the software</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.839" end="01:06:18.520" style="s2">that that writes those keys to the USB</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.210" end="01:06:20.770" style="s2">Drive you plug that into the jolla port</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.520" end="01:06:22.750" style="s2">and boot it up and now you have a server</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.770" end="01:06:24.880" style="s2">running on the whole network</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.750" end="01:06:26.740" style="s2">and you could do the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.880" end="01:06:29.380" style="s2">your boxes you bought on eBay you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.740" end="01:06:32.110" style="s2">have to buy our hardware but you do at</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.380" end="01:06:35.230" style="s2">this stage have to run huh Laporte OS</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.110" end="01:06:37.270" style="s2">which is a NIC so s built that is how</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.230" end="01:06:40.480" style="s2">we&#39;re distributing the hosting framework</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.270" end="01:06:42.610" style="s2">right now it it loads up holo chain and</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.480" end="01:06:45.190" style="s2">sets up the tools for being able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.610" end="01:06:47.710" style="s2">install hosted apps and all that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.190" end="01:06:50.950" style="s2">thing and the problem is that we shipped</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.710" end="01:06:54.010" style="s2">out those holo ports in January and here</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.950" end="01:06:57.070" style="s2">we are in April almost end of April and</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.010" end="01:06:59.770" style="s2">the holo hosting network is not publicly</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.070" end="01:07:02.470" style="s2">available yet we&#39;ve been still running</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.770" end="01:07:05.350" style="s2">tests behind the scenes and having some</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.470" end="01:07:07.240" style="s2">performance glitches and stuff as you</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.350" end="01:07:09.130" style="s2">may know distributed systems are hard</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.240" end="01:07:12.190" style="s2">and debugging distributed systems is</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.130" end="01:07:14.170" style="s2">hard and so we actually haven&#39;t opened</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.190" end="01:07:16.900" style="s2">the hosting network up to the public yet</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.170" end="01:07:18.430" style="s2">but that is the intention imagine some</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.900" end="01:07:22.300" style="s2">of those people about those holo ports</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.430" end="01:07:25.420" style="s2">aren&#39;t too happy yeah I imagine so I</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.300" end="01:07:27.100" style="s2">mean we know so yeah presumably they</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.420" end="01:07:29.290" style="s2">were buying them for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.100" end="01:07:30.670" style="s2">getting paid to host apps was that</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.290" end="01:07:33.190" style="s2">pretty much why they bought them</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.670" end="01:07:35.620" style="s2">yeah certainly some were a lot were</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.190" end="01:07:38.950" style="s2">really excited about the vision I mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.620" end="01:07:41.560" style="s2">we have a core community that is really</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.950" end="01:07:43.570" style="s2">excited about where we&#39;re coming from in</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.560" end="01:07:44.890" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing and very supportive of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.570" end="01:07:48.100" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing in supportive of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.890" end="01:07:49.630" style="s2">pure hosted web vision and yes it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.100" end="01:07:51.460" style="s2">great to get paid in some crypto but I</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.630" end="01:07:53.470" style="s2">don&#39;t think anybody thought I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.460" end="01:07:55.540" style="s2">make my living off of running one one</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.470" end="01:07:57.700" style="s2">little you know a little Mac Mini style</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.540" end="01:07:58.960" style="s2">device connects in my internet router</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.700" end="01:08:01.210" style="s2">because if you could then everybody</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.960" end="01:08:03.250" style="s2">would do it and then price you get down</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.210" end="01:08:05.830" style="s2">and you&#39;d be making an eleven cents a</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.250" end="01:08:08.110" style="s2">month right just for my own information</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.830" end="01:08:10.150" style="s2">because I am gonna build a polo chain</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.110" end="01:08:13.900" style="s2">app is there some benefit to having a</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.150" end="01:08:16.359" style="s2">holo port host my own app well the way</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.900" end="01:08:18.279" style="s2">that I envision this and this is is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.359" end="01:08:19.960" style="s2">yes you can put self hosted apps on your</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.279" end="01:08:24.069" style="s2">own Jolla port if you will on your whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.960" end="01:08:26.109" style="s2">whole port OS so the idea is that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.069" end="01:08:28.029" style="s2">could handshake between some of your</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.109" end="01:08:30.549" style="s2">other devices say your laptop and your</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.029" end="01:08:33.100" style="s2">phone and your Jolla port and the Jolla</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.549" end="01:08:35.890" style="s2">port then kind of becomes your own</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.100" end="01:08:36.819" style="s2">personal secure data backup of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.890" end="01:08:38.739" style="s2">things that you have doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.819" end="01:08:40.089" style="s2">going on on your phone and laptop and</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.739" end="01:08:42.909" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have to worry if your</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.089" end="01:08:44.980" style="s2">laptop gets stolen or your phone gets</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.909" end="01:08:46.900" style="s2">lost or goes drops into the toilet or</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.980" end="01:08:50.020" style="s2">whatever right with the key management</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.900" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">if it got stolen you can revoke the keys</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.020" end="01:08:55.810" style="s2">and make a new set and pull things from</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:58.060" style="s2">your mykola port as your own personal</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.810" end="01:09:01.299" style="s2">data backup and regenerate your state</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.060" end="01:09:02.710" style="s2">you know you get what I&#39;m saying right</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.299" end="01:09:05.049" style="s2">now I don&#39;t need to right go on with the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.710" end="01:09:06.699" style="s2">examples but well there&#39;s a reason to</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.049" end="01:09:09.730" style="s2">have sort of like your own little stable</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.699" end="01:09:12.460" style="s2">box that doesn&#39;t get stolen when your</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.730" end="01:09:14.380" style="s2">backpack gets stolen or whatever yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.460" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">gosh and I could still peer with other</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.380" end="01:09:18.489" style="s2">people you know yeah whether they have</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.480" end="01:09:19.630" style="s2">whole ports or not right at cetera okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.489" end="01:09:20.889" style="s2">that&#39;s good so I think I&#39;ll get me a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.630" end="01:09:21.400" style="s2">whole port when I start playing with</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.889" end="01:09:23.949" style="s2">this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.400" end="01:09:25.509" style="s2">bad besides you know me I&#39;m a hopeless</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.949" end="01:09:28.449" style="s2">techie I always like to play with</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.509" end="01:09:30.699" style="s2">something new let&#39;s go on to another</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.449" end="01:09:31.929" style="s2">topic which I think there&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.699" end="01:09:33.730" style="s2">of confusion about I&#39;m still confused</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.929" end="01:09:36.670" style="s2">tell you the truth what is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.730" end="01:09:40.569" style="s2">difference between holo fuel which seems</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.670" end="01:09:44.170" style="s2">to be the currency for paying for holo</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.569" end="01:09:49.359" style="s2">distributed serving capability and your</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.170" end="01:09:51.130" style="s2">hot er c20 token so holo fuel runs on</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.359" end="01:09:55.060" style="s2">the holo chain and powers the whole</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.130" end="01:09:56.969" style="s2">hosting network and needs to be tuned in</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.060" end="01:10:00.550" style="s2">terms of its performance and price</p>

<p begin="01:10:00.550" end="01:10:05.139" style="s2">the order of magnitude of millions if</p>

<p begin="01:10:38.139" end="01:10:43.659" style="s2">their requests right so that you end up</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.780" end="01:10:45.699" style="s2">with a log that they can provide as</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.659" end="01:10:47.210" style="s2">proof of service essentially that they</p>

<p begin="01:10:47.210" end="01:10:54.380" style="s2">and that then becomes an invoice that</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.650" end="01:10:56.450" style="s2">you as an app provider instead of paying</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.380" end="01:10:57.950" style="s2">Amazon for hosting services you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:11:16.850" end="01:11:23.000" style="s2">point right so the fact that they</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.120" end="01:11:25.760" style="s2">invoice you what they do is they give</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.000" end="01:11:28.460" style="s2">you a little key that lets you collect</p>

<p begin="01:11:28.460" end="01:11:31.969" style="s2">then you can do your fraud detection on</p>

<p begin="01:11:31.969" end="01:11:35.090" style="s2">make sure that they did the work but</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.260" end="01:11:37.489" style="s2">most importantly it gives you the data</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.090" end="01:11:40.550" style="s2">of the activity levels and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.489" end="01:11:42.140" style="s2">happening in in your app otherwise how</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.550" end="01:11:44.750" style="s2">would you even know what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.140" end="01:11:47.150" style="s2">a peer hosted app right like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.750" end="01:11:49.370" style="s2">have central logs anymore I mean of</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.150" end="01:11:51.830" style="s2">course we know logs are important or you</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.370" end="01:11:53.719" style="s2">know go on for tweeting rubble shooting</p>

<p begin="01:11:56.690" end="01:12:03.500" style="s2">lot of a lot of things right anyway so</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.810" end="01:12:05.180" style="s2">the whole Oh fuel is for powering that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.500" end="01:12:08.570" style="s2">Network we need to be able to do very</p>

<p begin="01:12:28.100" end="01:12:33.140" style="s2">that cost for each one of these Colo</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.250" end="01:12:36.739" style="s2">fuel transactions we have to build a</p>

<p begin="01:12:36.739" end="01:12:40.370" style="s2">don&#39;t mean cost even in terms of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.690" end="01:12:43.430" style="s2">transaction fee I just mean overall</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.370" end="01:12:47.000" style="s2">system cost right because we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.430" end="01:12:49.280" style="s2">small micro transactions so we&#39;re tuning</p>

<p begin="01:12:49.280" end="01:12:52.670" style="s2">there&#39;s probably going to be a cap on</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.050" end="01:12:55.180" style="s2">the size of transaction you can do in</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.670" end="01:12:58.010" style="s2">hollow fuel because the validation</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.180" end="01:12:59.940" style="s2">security behind it is only sort of up to</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.010" end="01:13:02.040" style="s2">a certain level there are certain</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.940" end="01:13:04.710" style="s2">types of attacks that if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.040" end="01:13:07.469" style="s2">invest a chunk of money and building a</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.710" end="01:13:09.000" style="s2">parallel computing network and that kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.469" end="01:13:11.219" style="s2">of thing that you could try to do on</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.000" end="01:13:14.460" style="s2">holo fuel but if you can only do that</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.219" end="01:13:15.600" style="s2">for a $1 or $10 transaction it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.460" end="01:13:18.180" style="s2">worth spending thousands of dollars</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.600" end="01:13:22.290" style="s2">building a competing you know network to</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.180" end="01:13:25.530" style="s2">falsify the $10 transaction right so</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.290" end="01:13:27.660" style="s2">that&#39;s holo fuel the hot token was</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.530" end="01:13:30.420" style="s2">something that we did a community</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.660" end="01:13:33.960" style="s2">offering as a placeholder and we&#39;ll swap</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.420" end="01:13:35.520" style="s2">one-to-one into Ola fuel as the home of</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.960" end="01:13:38.010" style="s2">fuel actually goes into its beta launch</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.520" end="01:13:39.810" style="s2">and the whole hosting network goes into</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.010" end="01:13:42.660" style="s2">its beta launch those are the two</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.810" end="01:13:44.670" style="s2">different things so holo token is an ER</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.660" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">C 20 token that lives out there on</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.670" end="01:13:49.469" style="s2">exchanges and it&#39;s the temporary thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:51.690" style="s2">and and as you mentioned and that other</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.469" end="01:13:53.699" style="s2">project has attracted a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.690" end="01:13:55.020" style="s2">that you know love or hate us depending</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.699" end="01:13:58.739" style="s2">on whether the market is up or the</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.020" end="01:14:01.940" style="s2">market is down but that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.739" end="01:14:03.780" style="s2">that&#39;s our core community as much yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.940" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">you literally you&#39;re gonna do a</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.780" end="01:14:09.270" style="s2">one-to-one exchange when the holo fuel</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.239" end="01:14:12.540" style="s2">goes live so anyone can convert a hot</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.270" end="01:14:15.270" style="s2">token to a one-hole of fuel token yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.540" end="01:14:17.250" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a swap window at least</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.270" end="01:14:19.560" style="s2">a six month period where it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.250" end="01:14:21.300" style="s2">one-to-one redemption okay now</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.560" end="01:14:22.590" style="s2">interestingly at least in my view I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.300" end="01:14:24.210" style="s2">having someone thought about this least</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.590" end="01:14:26.219" style="s2">a little bit you may want to think</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.210" end="01:14:28.410" style="s2">differently about things like price</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.219" end="01:14:32.070" style="s2">stability on something like whole of</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.410" end="01:14:33.660" style="s2">fuel versus you know a typical er C 20</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.070" end="01:14:35.550" style="s2">token which is frankly mostly</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.660" end="01:14:37.680" style="s2">speculative you know have you thought</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.550" end="01:14:40.350" style="s2">about how you want the price of holo</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.680" end="01:14:43.500" style="s2">fuel to vary over time you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.350" end="01:14:46.020" style="s2">stable deflationary inflationary do you</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.500" end="01:14:47.190" style="s2">have a view about that or I think you do</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.020" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">you thought you&#39;ve designed a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.190" end="01:14:51.270" style="s2">currencies I imagine you have a view</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.719" end="01:14:53.040" style="s2">about that yeah as you know I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.270" end="01:14:55.020" style="s2">currency geek and part of part of what</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.040" end="01:14:57.600" style="s2">we were setting out to do with holo fuel</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.020" end="01:15:00.180" style="s2">is to provide some healthy examples to</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.600" end="01:15:01.860" style="s2">the largely what I view as unhealthy</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.180" end="01:15:03.690" style="s2">speculative patterns that are out there</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.860" end="01:15:05.070" style="s2">the kind of sort of token ah makes</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.690" end="01:15:06.960" style="s2">people have gotten in their head of just</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.070" end="01:15:09.330" style="s2">you create a bunch of stuff and try to</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.960" end="01:15:12.210" style="s2">then kind of hype it into people</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.330" end="01:15:13.770" style="s2">believing it has value and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.210" end="01:15:17.160" style="s2">some people get burned and some people</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.770" end="01:15:20.070" style="s2">get rich and you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.160" end="01:15:22.380" style="s2">a very safe space for mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.070" end="01:15:24.810" style="s2">business to operate though if I accept</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.380" end="01:15:27.630" style="s2">payment this week and the bottom might</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.810" end="01:15:31.469" style="s2">fall out 50% and I can&#39;t pay my rent</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.630" end="01:15:33.810" style="s2">next week in it right that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.469" end="01:15:35.400" style="s2">for most businesses that are not in the</p>

<p begin="01:15:38.070" end="01:15:44.160" style="s2">fuel is designed to be anti volatile I</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.210" end="01:15:45.900" style="s2">would say value stable but people then</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.160" end="01:15:48.570" style="s2">think stable coin now they think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.900" end="01:15:50.880" style="s2">fixed to an external currency it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:15:50.880" end="01:15:55.680" style="s2">driven by feedback loops based on the</p>

<p begin="01:15:55.680" end="01:16:00.690" style="s2">have and there&#39;s real costs electricity</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.630" end="01:16:02.460" style="s2">bandwidth you know hardware and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.690" end="01:16:05.060" style="s2">that&#39;s going to create a real operating</p>

<p begin="01:16:05.060" end="01:16:09.360" style="s2">pricing is driven by and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.070" end="01:16:12.300" style="s2">you really want to get into all of the</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.300" end="01:16:16.860" style="s2">definitely it designed to be a very</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.190" end="01:16:19.860" style="s2">different kind of currency than than the</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.860" end="01:16:22.050" style="s2">norm yeah okay that&#39;s good and I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.860" end="01:16:24.210" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a good place to wrap</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.050" end="01:16:26.730" style="s2">this up I still have some other things</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.210" end="01:16:28.739" style="s2">to talk about and frankly I&#39;m a currency</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.730" end="01:16:30.930" style="s2">geek - actually I&#39;ve spent eight years</p>

<p begin="01:16:30.930" end="01:16:34.560" style="s2">actually designed a couple I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.790" end="01:16:36.090" style="s2">have you back on some time just to talk</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.560" end="01:16:38.940" style="s2">about currency would you like to do that</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.090" end="01:16:41.940" style="s2">love to do that okay we&#39;ll do it that&#39;s</p>
