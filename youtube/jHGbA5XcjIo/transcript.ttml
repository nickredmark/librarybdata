<p begin="00:00:02.010" end="00:00:07.710" style="s2">the culture war that first started in</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.529" end="00:00:10.650" style="s2">the 1960s but instead of left against</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.710" end="00:00:13.230" style="s2">right now each side has fragmented into</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.650" end="00:00:16.820" style="s2">different tribes fighting amongst</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.230" end="00:00:21.750" style="s2">themselves a multipolar war</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.820" end="00:00:24.590" style="s2">welcome to culture war 2.0 to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.750" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">it we need new tools</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.590" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">baccala so I think people have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:33.930" style="s2">of what the culture is is is people</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">battling over ideas mainly in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">political landscape and in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">whitepaper we invited the reader to view</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.489" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">culture war 1.0 as what was occurring in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">the 90s something between the secular</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">left versus the religious right and some</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:57.300" style="s2">of the battle fronts there were you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:01:01.620" style="s2">gay marriage women&#39;s issues of abortion</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.300" end="00:01:04.830" style="s2">and largely which we&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.620" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">moment is that cultural or 1.0 the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.830" end="00:01:09.659" style="s2">second I left one it essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">this opened the door for culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.659" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">so I think to understand that transition</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.460" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">it&#39;s important to review this idea a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">mental model from international</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">relations called polarity</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">there&#39;s three types of polarities</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:28.940" style="s2">there&#39;s uni polarity there&#39;s by polarity</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:31.890" style="s2">and there&#39;s multipolarity unipolarity is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.940" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">one country essentially dominating so</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.890" end="00:01:38.729" style="s2">Pax Britannica or Pax Americana by</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">polarity is the Cold War when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.729" end="00:01:43.250" style="s2">two superpowers sort of keeping each</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:45.090" style="s2">other in check the US and the USSR and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.250" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">multipolarity is when there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">countries that were maybe equally</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">powerful and you&#39;re there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:53.190" style="s2">uncertainty in these situations and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:56.550" style="s2">usually these are the most chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.190" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">moments in our history so just before</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.550" end="00:02:01.679" style="s2">World War one or before World War two it</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">was said to be a multipolar state so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.679" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">use this polarity idea with the culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">war culture war 2.0 was a multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:15.420" style="s2">affair where there&#39;s not just two ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:17.730" style="s2">two positions in logical space competing</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:22.100" style="s2">with each other it was a multitude of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:22.100" style="s2">different ideologies combatting</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.209" end="00:02:29.180" style="s2">so all these different viewpoints are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.879" end="00:02:30.950" style="s2">what we dubbed medic tribes it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.180" end="00:02:33.230" style="s2">like capture the flag but it&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.950" end="00:02:34.280" style="s2">capture the meta-narrative the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.230" end="00:02:36.500" style="s2">narrative that can help all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.280" end="00:02:37.730" style="s2">different narratives so the term that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.500" end="00:02:39.109" style="s2">like to use was the the noosphere</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.730" end="00:02:41.180" style="s2">essentially just a collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.109" end="00:02:45.189" style="s2">consciousness so it seems like a race</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.180" end="00:02:48.200" style="s2">between capturing this meta-narrative I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.189" end="00:02:51.799" style="s2">have a sort of a proclivity to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.200" end="00:02:53.420" style="s2">all sorts of ideas from all all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.799" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">spectrums the political spectrum of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.420" end="00:02:57.079" style="s2">philosophical spectrums a theological</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:03:00.200" style="s2">ones so I created a group called</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.079" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">intellectual Explorers Club so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.200" end="00:03:05.180" style="s2">is that were performative agnostics</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:08.840" style="s2">where we can act as if an idea is true</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.180" end="00:03:10.340" style="s2">without accepting it as true it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.840" end="00:03:11.659" style="s2">something interesting about the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.340" end="00:03:14.060" style="s2">the group the intellectual Explorers</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.659" end="00:03:16.549" style="s2">Club because it attracted invited all</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.060" end="00:03:19.790" style="s2">sorts of different people with different</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.549" end="00:03:21.260" style="s2">ideologies from feminists to men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.790" end="00:03:22.939" style="s2">rights activists to conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.260" end="00:03:25.159" style="s2">liberals and I was the facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.939" end="00:03:27.409" style="s2">taking in all these points of views and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.159" end="00:03:29.810" style="s2">just feeling the tension of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.409" end="00:03:33.079" style="s2">waiting for their turn so they can spit</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.810" end="00:03:35.569" style="s2">out their position and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.079" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">afforded me understanding and I got a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.569" end="00:03:40.099" style="s2">visceral level of the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:42.979" style="s2">because I got a front-row seat to it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.099" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">speak personally I felt the existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.979" end="00:03:46.220" style="s2">loneliness just sort of being in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:48.169" style="s2">intellectual circles having a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.220" end="00:03:49.819" style="s2">conversation because there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.169" end="00:03:51.470" style="s2">that people are so eagerly attached to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.819" end="00:03:53.180" style="s2">their ideas that they were just waiting</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.470" end="00:03:55.579" style="s2">for you to finish talking so they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.180" end="00:03:58.790" style="s2">kind of you know impose their worldview</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.579" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">on you and there&#39;s a lack of care in all</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.790" end="00:04:04.849" style="s2">fronts from all all spectrums and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.150" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">found the act of understanding someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.849" end="00:04:10.159" style="s2">worldview what they believed to be true</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:12.019" style="s2">sort of like an act of love it disarmed</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.159" end="00:04:13.459" style="s2">them in a way and it disarmed me too</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.019" end="00:04:17.780" style="s2">because then invited me into their world</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.459" end="00:04:21.229" style="s2">and it was unexpected the insights that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.780" end="00:04:22.940" style="s2">I got from it and the metaphor I liked</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.229" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">is the blind men in the elephants where</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.940" end="00:04:28.250" style="s2">there&#39;s all these blind men they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:30.110" style="s2">touching an elephant and they view their</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.250" end="00:04:32.360" style="s2">point on the elephant where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.110" end="00:04:36.169" style="s2">touching it at the trunk or or the tail</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.360" end="00:04:37.129" style="s2">as their reality and what the good thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.169" end="00:04:39.139" style="s2">about that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.129" end="00:04:41.330" style="s2">that they&#39;re hyper focused on that area</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.139" end="00:04:43.999" style="s2">they feel the texture they can smell it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.330" end="00:04:45.679" style="s2">and that affords them ability to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.999" end="00:04:48.019" style="s2">things that we might not otherwise see</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.679" end="00:04:49.849" style="s2">if we weren&#39;t touching that spot but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.019" end="00:04:52.219" style="s2">problem is is that if you just view that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.849" end="00:04:53.419" style="s2">spot as the entirety of reality then</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.219" end="00:04:56.389" style="s2">you&#39;re in trouble you need to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.419" end="00:04:57.919" style="s2">each other so the way I see the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.389" end="00:04:59.029" style="s2">right now is all these blind men just</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.919" end="00:05:03.110" style="s2">yelling at each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.029" end="00:05:04.939" style="s2">you know violently and my hope my kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.110" end="00:05:06.949" style="s2">of this idea of being a performative</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.939" end="00:05:09.379" style="s2">agnostic is if people to invite them in</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.949" end="00:05:11.719" style="s2">a space of playful uncertainty the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.379" end="00:05:13.189" style="s2">sexxxy uncertainty if you will so they</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.719" end="00:05:18.199" style="s2">can get to talk to each other and figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.189" end="00:05:19.519" style="s2">out their world so mimetic tribes you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.199" end="00:05:21.349" style="s2">probably familiar with some of the names</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.519" end="00:05:23.869" style="s2">that are active in the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.349" end="00:05:28.099" style="s2">whether it be the social justice</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:43.439" style="s2">certain tribe that we don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.499" end="00:06:45.860" style="s2">triggered</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.439" end="00:06:48.119" style="s2">I do think there&#39;s intertribal</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.860" end="00:06:49.649" style="s2">competition amongst what was</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.119" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">traditionally known as the left and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.649" end="00:06:54.179" style="s2">the right like i like i mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:56.969" style="s2">class base left versus the social</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.179" end="00:06:58.409" style="s2">justice left this idea of cancel culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.969" end="00:07:01.889" style="s2">or what mark fisher calls the vampyre</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.409" end="00:07:03.029" style="s2">castle people on the left just as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.889" end="00:07:05.339" style="s2">as people on the right could get</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.029" end="00:07:07.169" style="s2">cancelled these days and same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.339" end="00:07:09.689" style="s2">the the right there&#39;s a whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.169" end="00:07:11.550" style="s2">don&#39;t punch right but a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.689" end="00:07:14.339" style="s2">are punching right and left these days</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.550" end="00:07:17.309" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a sense that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.339" end="00:07:21.449" style="s2">don&#39;t know what will defend what people</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.309" end="00:07:24.149" style="s2">or what will trigger what tribe the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.449" end="00:07:26.009" style="s2">was an invitation to the reader to look</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.149" end="00:07:27.839" style="s2">at it from a different perspective and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.009" end="00:07:29.399" style="s2">view this this this whole whole white</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.839" end="00:07:31.379" style="s2">paper in mimetic tribes in the frame</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.399" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">that this is a multipolar almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.379" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">postmodern war is this sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.979" style="s2">psychoactive drug because if you see the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:39.719" style="s2">the mimetic tribe that you belong to</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.979" end="00:07:41.819" style="s2">alongside all these other mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.719" end="00:07:42.809" style="s2">that might jog you out of your belief</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.819" end="00:07:46.499" style="s2">system just for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.809" end="00:07:48.589" style="s2">one aspect about mimetic tribes is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.499" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">the sense that they&#39;re disembodied</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.589" end="00:07:55.979" style="s2">because they&#39;re exercising this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:58.439" style="s2">tribalism around a certain idea a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.979" end="00:08:00.360" style="s2">certain ideology a certain mean Plex but</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.439" end="00:08:05.579" style="s2">not really meeting or go hearing in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.360" end="00:08:07.349" style="s2">person and there&#39;s a an egoic aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.579" end="00:08:09.629" style="s2">this there there&#39;s their ego likely</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.349" end="00:08:14.729" style="s2">attached to the ideas that there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.629" end="00:08:17.819" style="s2">fighting with where I think what rebel</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.729" end="00:08:19.079" style="s2">wisdom is gesturing towards and various</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.819" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">different people in a sense making web</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.079" end="00:08:23.069" style="s2">is trying to create an embodied tribe</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:26.710" style="s2">where people actually get together in</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.069" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">person and explore ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.710" end="00:08:33.380" style="s2">so we had four events that brought us to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:36.710" style="s2">where we are today in culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.380" end="00:08:40.280" style="s2">event one was surprisingly the fall of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.710" end="00:08:42.470" style="s2">Occupy there was an energy in the air</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.280" end="00:08:45.620" style="s2">when Occupy was going on a revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.470" end="00:08:49.280" style="s2">spirit with the left was a class-based</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.620" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">left and when Occupy fell there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.280" end="00:08:53.960" style="s2">period of leftist activism on the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:59.180" style="s2">that went quite quiet in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.960" end="00:09:02.270" style="s2">from around 2011 to 2015 and during this</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.180" end="00:09:05.720" style="s2">time the left at least publicly pivoted</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.270" end="00:09:09.710" style="s2">towards more of a social justice ideas</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.720" end="00:09:11.630" style="s2">more more of what they call woke and was</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.710" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">interesting to notice during this time</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.630" end="00:09:14.120" style="s2">period because it seemed like social</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:17.650" style="s2">justice was in the air</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.120" end="00:09:21.490" style="s2">it was just amplifying and corporations</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.650" end="00:09:23.930" style="s2">co-opted the social justice means</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.490" end="00:09:26.900" style="s2">specifically HR departments and PR</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.930" end="00:09:28.700" style="s2">departments and we have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.900" end="00:09:30.770" style="s2">provocative line is that corporations</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.700" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">can be woke but they can&#39;t be anti</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.770" end="00:09:36.470" style="s2">capital so this essentially neutered the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:39.170" style="s2">left for a time period the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.470" end="00:09:41.720" style="s2">class-based left and it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.170" end="00:09:43.970" style="s2">amplified the social justice narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.720" end="00:09:48.199" style="s2">in society at large</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.970" end="00:09:50.619" style="s2">so the second event was oberfeld vs.</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.199" end="00:09:53.149" style="s2">Hodges when the Supreme Court in America</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.619" end="00:09:57.049" style="s2">legalized gay marriage across the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.149" end="00:10:00.049" style="s2">country and as Rod Dreher said this was</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.049" end="00:10:03.109" style="s2">the death blow to the religious right</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.049" end="00:10:06.259" style="s2">this was the end of the culture war as</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.109" end="00:10:08.239" style="s2">he put it or culture war 1.0 as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.259" end="00:10:14.449" style="s2">framed it and this was sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.239" end="00:10:18.139" style="s2">beginning of culture war 2.0 so event 3</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.449" end="00:10:22.489" style="s2">we provocatively said was Caitlyn Jenner</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.139" end="00:10:23.989" style="s2">and I recall hearing something from Joe</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.489" end="00:10:26.599" style="s2">Rogan or what I believe I heard from Joe</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.989" end="00:10:29.209" style="s2">Rogan and he essentially said that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.599" end="00:10:33.049" style="s2">reason why Trump won was because Caitlyn</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.209" end="00:10:35.419" style="s2">Jenner you know right when the gay</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.049" end="00:10:38.529" style="s2">marriage legislation was passed the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.419" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">trans issue just rushed into the public</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.529" end="00:10:44.089" style="s2">public mind and a lot of people might</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:47.059" style="s2">have not been ready for this the slew of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.089" end="00:10:51.889" style="s2">trans issues started arising bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.059" end="00:10:55.239" style="s2">bills trans athletes and pronouns and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.889" end="00:10:58.129" style="s2">lot of famous figures in the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.239" end="00:10:59.509" style="s2">came on the scene due to these issues a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.129" end="00:11:01.549" style="s2">lot of the figures in the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.509" end="00:11:05.019" style="s2">dark rub for example like ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.549" end="00:11:07.729" style="s2">and our Toronto&#39;s own jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.019" end="00:11:09.499" style="s2">came out specifically for the pronoun</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.729" end="00:11:13.019" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.499" end="00:11:16.439" style="s2">event for the Kaos President Donald</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.019" end="00:11:19.470" style="s2">Trump and there there&#39;s something in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.439" end="00:11:22.139" style="s2">air when Trump was running it just felt</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.470" end="00:11:23.660" style="s2">like chaos something we were seeing</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.139" end="00:11:25.889" style="s2">something that hasn&#39;t happened before</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.660" end="00:11:27.809" style="s2">and there&#39;s a quote by Trump Tuesday&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.889" end="00:11:31.050" style="s2">he loves chaos and maybe it&#39;s a part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.809" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">his negotiation strategy of how he makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.050" end="00:11:34.589" style="s2">people puts people in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.850" end="00:11:36.029" style="s2">uncertainty and he&#39;s bringing his</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.589" end="00:11:37.709" style="s2">business techniques and his negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.029" end="00:11:40.050" style="s2">techniques into the political arena and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.709" end="00:11:44.220" style="s2">during this time - there&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.050" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">occurrences with Pepe the Frog the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.220" end="00:11:49.290" style="s2">God and there&#39;s just the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:52.970" style="s2">something was going on that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.290" end="00:11:52.970" style="s2">stabilizing - where everyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.110" end="00:12:02.500" style="s2">so we talked about six crises and four</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.510" end="00:12:05.589" style="s2">events that led to culture war 2.0 and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.500" end="00:12:07.510" style="s2">think it&#39;s useful to have these in mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.589" end="00:12:10.510" style="s2">because they offer sort of a historical</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.510" end="00:12:14.139" style="s2">and then philosophical events that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.510" end="00:12:17.110" style="s2">occurred that sort of give understanding</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.139" end="00:12:19.110" style="s2">of where we are today so the first one</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.110" end="00:12:22.079" style="s2">that we we talked about was</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.110" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">secularization and the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:28.930" style="s2">and how I hold the meaning crisis or one</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:30.790" style="s2">way that I hold it is there&#39;s this lack</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.930" end="00:12:33.490" style="s2">of meta-narrative or grand narrative</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.790" end="00:12:36.430" style="s2">that sort of justifies an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.490" end="00:12:38.949" style="s2">practices that can engender and sustain</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.430" end="00:12:40.930" style="s2">that felt sense of meaningfulness and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.949" end="00:12:43.269" style="s2">don&#39;t have that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.930" end="00:12:47.589" style="s2">we reference the the famous Nietzsche in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.269" end="00:12:49.930" style="s2">line God is dead and the idea that once</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.589" end="00:12:52.029" style="s2">that Christian met a narrative got</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.930" end="00:12:54.519" style="s2">destroyed in society there was no</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.029" end="00:12:56.470" style="s2">justification for doing a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.519" end="00:13:01.089" style="s2">that might engender that state of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.470" end="00:13:02.890" style="s2">meaningfulness and a lot of secular</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.089" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">theorists that they have this term</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.890" end="00:13:06.730" style="s2">called the substraction theory of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:10.089" style="s2">secularization and the idea that once</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.730" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">you remove religion from our formal</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.089" end="00:13:14.829" style="s2">institutions will become all rational</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:16.750" style="s2">and scientific but as the famous</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.529" end="00:13:28.570" style="s2">were more likely to evolve into a state</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.890" end="00:13:30.220" style="s2">of plurality where all these different</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.570" end="00:13:32.949" style="s2">viewpoints are wrestling with each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.220" end="00:13:34.360" style="s2">the next crisis is the reality crisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.949" end="00:13:37.380" style="s2">and the greedy --nt associated with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.360" end="00:13:39.880" style="s2">is fragmentation and I like Scott Adams</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.390" end="00:20:43.790" style="s2">and I invite the listener right now to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.100" end="00:20:46.370" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.790" end="00:20:47.750" style="s2">and join in on this conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.370" end="00:20:49.610" style="s2">there&#39;s things that we&#39;re experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.750" end="00:20:52.750" style="s2">with in Toronto called the anti debate</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.610" end="00:20:55.730" style="s2">where it&#39;s sort of a gamification of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.750" end="00:20:57.860" style="s2">understanding there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.730" end="00:21:01.220" style="s2">conversational modalities like empathy</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.860" end="00:21:04.510" style="s2">circles where they apply Carl Rogers act</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.220" end="00:21:07.670" style="s2">of listening to a four-way conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.510" end="00:21:09.560" style="s2">getting people to look at new sites met</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.670" end="00:21:12.260" style="s2">a new sites like all sides that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.560" end="00:21:16.160" style="s2">shows the bias of each news platform on</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.160" end="00:21:20.810" style="s2">intellectuals that might not have spoke</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.070" end="00:21:24.340" style="s2">to each other otherwise to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.810" end="00:21:27.380" style="s2">have a long-form good faith conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.340" end="00:21:30.980" style="s2">so the matrix introduced this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.380" end="00:21:32.570" style="s2">the blue pill versus red pill and this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.980" end="00:21:34.490" style="s2">was co-opted by more of a reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.570" end="00:21:37.550" style="s2">tries but going back to its original</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.490" end="00:21:39.740" style="s2">meaning the blue pill is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.550" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">born into it&#39;s nobody really takes the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.740" end="00:21:43.100" style="s2">blue pill and you&#39;re given the blue pill</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re not aware that you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.100" end="00:21:47.320" style="s2">the blue pill</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:53.420" style="s2">so it&#39;s unexamined consensus reality and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.320" end="00:21:56.810" style="s2">the red pill is the dark truths that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.420" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">have not yet explored it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.810" end="00:22:03.560" style="s2">views that sort of rip your current or</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:07.460" style="s2">previous reality underneath your feet</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.560" end="00:22:10.520" style="s2">and taking the red pill has a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.460" end="00:22:14.800" style="s2">to try belies us make us angry give us</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.520" end="00:22:17.630" style="s2">sort of a purpose to fight for something</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.800" end="00:22:20.390" style="s2">where there&#39;s another pill that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.630" end="00:22:23.240" style="s2">Venkatesh Rao calls the gray pill and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.390" end="00:22:26.120" style="s2">this is a pill that sort of muddies the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.240" end="00:22:29.210" style="s2">water of your previous red pill truths</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.120" end="00:22:33.010" style="s2">it adds a little bit uncertainty to your</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.210" end="00:22:37.730" style="s2">positions and at first this might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.010" end="00:22:40.550" style="s2">anxiety producing this might engender an</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.730" end="00:22:42.020" style="s2">existential crisis but if you stay with</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.550" end="00:22:45.380" style="s2">it long enough if you stay with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.020" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">that gray pill sense life starts</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.380" end="00:22:50.390" style="s2">becoming playful you can start playing</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">with ideas there&#39;s a sexy uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.390" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">starts emerging and taking the gray pill</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:57.150" style="s2">is reintroducing nuance into the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">public conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.150" end="00:23:01.530" style="s2">mind there&#39;s there&#39;s too much certainty</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">out there there&#39;s certainty with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.530" end="00:23:07.290" style="s2">blue pill certainty with the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.360" end="00:23:10.110" style="s2">and the the gray pill offers us to speak</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.290" end="00:23:12.630" style="s2">in such a way where we can be assertive</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.110" end="00:23:16.200" style="s2">with our truths but with a caveat saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.630" end="00:23:18.420" style="s2">I could be wrong so there&#39;s a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.200" end="00:23:22.950" style="s2">I think lots of us share is that debate</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.420" end="00:23:24.360" style="s2">is broken people are just talking past</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.950" end="00:23:26.820" style="s2">each other it&#39;s sort of a dog and pony</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.360" end="00:23:28.500" style="s2">show and there&#39;s this term by Scott</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.820" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">Aikens and Robert Ellie is that quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.500" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">like called the dialectic fallacy where</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:34.440" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of gesturing towards your</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:37.050" style="s2">interlocutor that you&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.440" end="00:23:38.940" style="s2">conversation with them but really you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.050" end="00:23:42.380" style="s2">just trying to score points to your</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.940" end="00:23:46.530" style="s2">tribe so the anti defeat is an idea to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.380" end="00:23:48.750" style="s2">attract people to the debate format but</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.530" end="00:23:51.059" style="s2">it&#39;s not about winning it&#39;s about who</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.750" end="00:23:54.120" style="s2">can be better at understanding so it</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.059" end="00:23:57.030" style="s2">really is a Trojan horse towards more</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.120" end="00:23:58.380" style="s2">authentic dialogues and once you get we</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.030" end="00:23:59.790" style="s2">experimented with in Toronto and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.380" end="00:24:01.920" style="s2">quite powerful once you get a taste of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.790" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">that you want more of it and once you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.920" end="00:24:07.050" style="s2">get rid of that adversarial frame you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:09.270" style="s2">just sort of lose the structure and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.050" end="00:24:13.140" style="s2">you just want to have a free associate</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.270" end="00:24:15.090" style="s2">of exploratory conversation so this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.140" end="00:24:18.510" style="s2">term that I quite like called the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.090" end="00:24:20.610" style="s2">meta-crisis how I currently hold it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.510" end="00:24:24.750" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.610" end="00:24:27.960" style="s2">out there from economic environment AGI</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.750" end="00:24:30.750" style="s2">that threaten our existence and with all</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.960" end="00:24:33.330" style="s2">these existential risks is coupled with</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.750" end="00:24:35.309" style="s2">this inability to sense make an ability</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.330" end="00:24:38.610" style="s2">to have conversations to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.309" end="00:24:41.700" style="s2">to do about it and all the crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.610" end="00:24:44.490" style="s2">that we mentioned sort of baked in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.700" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">this meta crisis and my sense and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.490" end="00:24:50.250" style="s2">think John Vicki would agree with me is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:52.740" style="s2">that the first domino to knock over to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.250" end="00:24:55.050" style="s2">address all the other crises is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.740" end="00:24:57.390" style="s2">meaning crisis and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.050" end="00:25:00.420" style="s2">amongst the sense makers in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.390" end="00:25:02.130" style="s2">making a web is that meeting in person</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.420" end="00:25:04.380" style="s2">and engaging in these authentic</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.130" end="00:25:08.160" style="s2">dialogues whether it&#39;s circling</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.380" end="00:25:09.960" style="s2">restorative circles incite dialogue you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.160" end="00:25:10.650" style="s2">get in person and do these things and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.960" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">create a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.650" end="00:25:16.140" style="s2">body tried rather than just a memetic</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:20.520" style="s2">tribe could be the answer so I could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.140" end="00:25:22.530" style="s2">wrong but my sense is that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.520" end="00:25:26.010" style="s2">more comfortable with the state of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.530" end="00:25:28.530" style="s2">uncertainty and the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.010" end="00:25:30.690" style="s2">Explorers Club here in Toronto is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.530" end="00:25:33.780" style="s2">opportunity for that it&#39;s an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.690" end="00:25:36.270" style="s2">to be a performative agnostic to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.780" end="00:25:39.660" style="s2">explore different ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.270" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">radically foreign to you and once were</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.660" end="00:25:46.140" style="s2">uncomfortable with this state once we we</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:48.330" style="s2">add nuance to our ideas when we become</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.140" end="00:25:50.790" style="s2">grey pilled then I think we can start</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.330" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">practicing these conversational</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.790" end="00:25:56.190" style="s2">modalities is these authentic</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:25:58.440" style="s2">conversations that invite us to explore</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.190" end="00:26:01.020" style="s2">areas or we don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.440" end="00:26:04.460" style="s2">and I think that is needed in order to</p>
