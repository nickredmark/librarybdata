<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:07.710" style="s2">for letting me interview you okay and</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.060" end="00:00:09.719" style="s2">can you say a little bit about how the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.710" end="00:00:11.580" style="s2">Masters and holistic science at Omaha</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.719" end="00:00:13.969" style="s2">College started when did you first think</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:18.150" style="s2">about setting up a program like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.969" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">well it started when we developed the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.150" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">capacity for people to get credits for</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:24.480" style="s2">attending short courses three-week</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:27.830" style="s2">courses we did that through the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.480" end="00:00:33.540" style="s2">University of Plymouth and that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.830" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2">about let&#39;s see 13 years ago or so so</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.540" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">people could come on a regular short</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:41.910" style="s2">course and get 10 masters level credits</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">for that work um and we did that for</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.910" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">about 3 3 years or so that it was very</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:48.840" style="s2">successful we got quite a few people</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">doing the credits I was the academic</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.840" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">tutor along with petia Sullivan from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">University premise and others from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:56.610" style="s2">immersive chemist and it worked really</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">well for the next the next phase with</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">Aussie to expand it and to do a fully</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:04.979" style="s2">blown master&#39;s degree of our own and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">then I remember one day Ventana Shiva</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.979" end="00:01:09.150" style="s2">brought Brian Goodwin here to give a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.450" end="00:01:11.970" style="s2">talk and I was really really delighted</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.150" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">by his talk and he loved the college and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.970" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">gradually we realized that we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">start a master&#39;s degree with him so</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:24.659" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s how it got going really</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">and when can you sort of give a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.659" end="00:01:28.439" style="s2">bit of a historic background of when the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">first mussels were set up in hope sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.439" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">of developed over the years yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:36.530" style="s2">we&#39;re in our ninth year so this next</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">intake will be the 10th so it was 1998</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.530" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">we start out with two students a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:45.950" style="s2">professor of dentistry from South Africa</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">and a Japanese student as two students</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.950" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">um yeah we just got going really it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">very experimental</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">we had a module structure all approved</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:02:00.920" style="s2">by the University of Plymouth with five</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">modules over four months and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.920" end="00:02:05.219" style="s2">dissertation and then two optional</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">courses from the short course program</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:10.100" style="s2">and it seemed to work very well and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:12.590" style="s2">next year it went up</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.100" end="00:02:14.450" style="s2">we have the next year six I think and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.590" end="00:02:20.440" style="s2">just kept going up and going out so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.450" end="00:02:20.440" style="s2">hit the ceiling around 12 or 13 and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:25.310" style="s2">going back a little bit further how did</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">you first come to Omaha College and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.310" end="00:02:29.090" style="s2">you&#39;ve been here since the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m one of the founders of it young</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.090" end="00:02:34.820" style="s2">how did I get here well it was thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:36.380" style="s2">Tibetan monk they got here because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.820" end="00:02:38.330" style="s2">been in Costa Rica for two years</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.380" end="00:02:40.190" style="s2">teaching ecology the National University</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.330" end="00:02:41.720" style="s2">and then I came out to England for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.190" end="00:02:45.050" style="s2">little while I was heading back to Costa</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.720" end="00:02:46.940" style="s2">Rica but I was a member of a Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.050" end="00:02:48.800" style="s2">group at Oxford and this Tibetan monk</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.940" end="00:02:51.140" style="s2">came to their group who wanted to come</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.800" end="00:02:53.300" style="s2">down to Devon so I agreed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.140" end="00:02:55.700" style="s2">chauffeur and I came down here and heard</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.300" end="00:02:58.670" style="s2">about this nascent Institute here then</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.700" end="00:03:00.530" style="s2">called it shumar College at the time the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.670" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">doctor was wanting to set up and I came</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.530" end="00:03:05.450" style="s2">over and talked to say teach and John</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:08.240" style="s2">Lane and bears other people and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.450" end="00:03:12.650" style="s2">said well my become the ecologist of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.240" end="00:03:13.940" style="s2">this new Institute and James Lovelock is</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.650" end="00:03:16.190" style="s2">going to be the first teacher that all</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.940" end="00:03:18.230" style="s2">we had already been arranged and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.190" end="00:03:21.230" style="s2">got me excited president I read his book</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.230" end="00:03:22.310" style="s2">and was very interested in his work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.230" end="00:03:23.870" style="s2">then they decided to call it the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.310" end="00:03:27.770" style="s2">Schumacher College which I thought was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.870" end="00:03:31.730" style="s2">really brilliant name so I decided that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.770" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">it was my destiny to come here so I gave</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.730" end="00:03:36.290" style="s2">up on the game back to Costa Rica and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:37.670" style="s2">came here instead and then began my</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.290" end="00:03:41.000" style="s2">friendship with James Lovelock which has</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.670" end="00:03:43.670" style="s2">lasted all that time yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.000" end="00:03:46.610" style="s2">next thing that I wanted to and talk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.670" end="00:03:49.060" style="s2">you about you&#39;ve collaborated with James</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.610" end="00:03:52.190" style="s2">Lovelock and he&#39;s been a mentor and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.060" end="00:03:55.850" style="s2">friend for many years he say a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.190" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">bit more about what you&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.850" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">on and what impact he&#39;s had on your</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:04.010" style="s2">thinking and mmm-hmm well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:06.740" style="s2">surface superficial answer and a deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.010" end="00:04:08.750" style="s2">answer the superficial answer is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.740" end="00:04:12.890" style="s2">straightforward he gave me a computer</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.750" end="00:04:13.460" style="s2">and he gave me the code in basic for</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.890" end="00:04:16.040" style="s2">daisyworld</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.460" end="00:04:18.820" style="s2">and he said just go and play with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.040" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">because I taught myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.820" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">computer programming that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">I was doing my doctorate so I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:28.260" style="s2">familiar with how to structure computer</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">programs although I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.260" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">mathematician but I was able to see how</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:34.290" style="s2">data world works I had the equations</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:36.420" style="s2">there are six equations and I could see</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.290" end="00:04:37.920" style="s2">how he translated them into code it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.420" end="00:04:40.340" style="s2">very very interesting to see how that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.920" end="00:04:44.130" style="s2">worked how the numerical integration</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.340" end="00:04:46.680" style="s2">happens anyway so I thought wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.130" end="00:04:49.410" style="s2">very interesting stuff and then I hit on</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.680" end="00:04:50.940" style="s2">a few ideas for experiments for making</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.410" end="00:04:52.770" style="s2">them they&#39;ve evolved more ecologically</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.940" end="00:04:55.200" style="s2">realistic so he worked on that together</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:04:58.350" style="s2">for about five years or so and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.200" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">publish two papers on it so I used to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.350" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">to Kumail a lot and we were you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:05.160" style="s2">talking to him on the phone quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:07.550" style="s2">these are in the days when really no one</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.160" end="00:05:11.880" style="s2">no one else much was interested in Gaia</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.550" end="00:05:13.230" style="s2">he was felt quite isolated I think and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.880" end="00:05:15.630" style="s2">he was quite excited that there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.230" end="00:05:19.040" style="s2">someone an opposite of the biologist as</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.630" end="00:05:21.480" style="s2">he said it was interested in in his work</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.040" end="00:05:23.550" style="s2">later on lots of other people came</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.480" end="00:05:25.770" style="s2">people from the Met Office and Tim</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.550" end="00:05:27.990" style="s2">Linton and other people joined in who</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.770" end="00:05:30.150" style="s2">have you know really very very able in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.990" end="00:05:31.560" style="s2">this domain anyway so I did a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.150" end="00:05:35.640" style="s2">work with him on that but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.560" end="00:05:37.710" style="s2">superficial level of work but the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.640" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">thing is hard to pin down actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.710" end="00:05:45.530" style="s2">but it&#39;s that he&#39;s got a pen he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:49.160" style="s2">special personality and he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.530" end="00:05:51.810" style="s2">gentleness and a softness but also</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.160" end="00:05:56.220" style="s2">almost an indigenous understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:58.710" style="s2">what Gaia is poetic almost any mystic</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.220" end="00:06:02.700" style="s2">understanding and all of that came</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.710" end="00:06:04.770" style="s2">through to me just through being with</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.700" end="00:06:06.810" style="s2">him walking around his land talking to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.770" end="00:06:10.440" style="s2">him he sort of gave me a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.810" end="00:06:13.740" style="s2">nurturing a tremendous generosity and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.440" end="00:06:15.420" style="s2">mentoring that I received from him which</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.740" end="00:06:18.810" style="s2">was more just on an intellectual level</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.420" end="00:06:21.260" style="s2">it was um I think curative level really</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.810" end="00:06:24.990" style="s2">it&#39;s like being with the label wires</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.260" end="00:06:27.810" style="s2">English Aboriginal elder and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.990" end="00:06:30.380" style="s2">absorbed that quite a lot and it comes</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.810" end="00:06:34.110" style="s2">through it the way I talk about guy</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.380" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">so do you think that he holds a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.110" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">scientific view of Gaia and also</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:42.419" style="s2">something that is deeper that is almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:44.550" style="s2">like a spiritual and philosophical yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.419" end="00:06:47.850" style="s2">I think so he wouldn&#39;t like me to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.550" end="00:06:49.590" style="s2">this mm-hmm but yeah he&#39;s got a</p>
