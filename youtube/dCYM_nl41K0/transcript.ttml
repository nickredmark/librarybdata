<p begin="00:00:05.430" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s if for me it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.750" end="00:00:16.020" style="s2">already been a lovely learning journey</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:18.330" style="s2">to have this conversation series that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.020" end="00:00:20.250" style="s2">seem to be doing I&#39;m surprised that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:22.310" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s emerging and I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.250" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">it the regeneration rising and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.310" end="00:00:27.900" style="s2">conversations about regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">practice and I already had a really nice</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.900" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">conversation with Jason twill that and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:34.590" style="s2">Dominique Hesse and dropped in on she</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">couldn&#39;t make that the whole the whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.590" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">call and we were talking a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:44.850" style="s2">connections between both Australian and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:48.270" style="s2">Maori indigenous wisdom and how they</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.850" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">actually see resonance with the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.270" end="00:00:54.270" style="s2">of thinking and the intention M that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">in in regenerative practice and how they</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.270" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">can mutually fertilize each other those</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">those wisdom traditions to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">and and I also like I Jason really</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2">deeply opened up with a personal story</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:11.000" style="s2">so I went at yesterday talked to Bill I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.040" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">also asked him to really start with if</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.000" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">if regenerative practice is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:16.830" style="s2">fundamentally different from all these</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">other practices because it really</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.830" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">acknowledges that the work really starts</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">within and that ultimately it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">shifting consciousness ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">the way that we ask questions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:31.560" style="s2">observe ourselves in how we even frame</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:34.170" style="s2">how to respond to the question how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.560" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">can add value and and regenerate a place</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.170" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">and I would love to hear how you got</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">into all of this and what was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">stories what were the moments where you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">just felt called to do this kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">and and then inform yourself on how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">do it so well specifying moments is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:00.860" style="s2">always interesting I may be just in let</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:05.820" style="s2">me start with a more general statement I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.860" end="00:02:10.459" style="s2">kind of popped into life as as I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">from early days a very strong advocate</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.459" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">proselytizer sort of personality</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:21.210" style="s2">so a lot of my life early life in school</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">and college and and in the few years</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.210" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">afterwards were filled with peace</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.630" end="00:02:31.770" style="s2">movement with civil rights I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">out there sure that that we were going</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.770" end="00:02:37.140" style="s2">to transform the world and do it next</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">week if we could just think and push</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.140" end="00:02:43.770" style="s2">hard enough and that was a lot of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:47.390" style="s2">know I was out organizing things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.770" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">Stanford the around the Vietnam War in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.390" end="00:02:55.560" style="s2">1962 and nobody even heard of it at that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">point in you know our area but that kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.560" end="00:02:59.850" style="s2">of carried me forward that was I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">felt it was really important to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.850" end="00:03:06.390" style="s2">responsible and take a role and then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:11.220" style="s2">got one of those sort of up the side</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.390" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">that had events and our daughter got</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.220" end="00:03:20.340" style="s2">cancer and she was bone cancer she was</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">11 when that happened and she was truly</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:24.660" style="s2">one of these old Souls just quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.920" end="00:03:27.180" style="s2">remarkable human being</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.660" end="00:03:30.300" style="s2">and we traveled that journey with her</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.180" end="00:03:33.810" style="s2">for three years and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.300" end="00:03:41.330" style="s2">that I learned that she helped teach me</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.810" end="00:03:45.290" style="s2">and many other people was how ephemeral</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.330" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">the kind of functional things we do and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.290" end="00:03:53.880" style="s2">successes we see and how exterior they</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:04:00.060" style="s2">are to what and who we really need to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.880" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">and so during the time I&#39;d been working</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.060" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">with Carol Sanford I mean we were our</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:07.290" style="s2">daughters met when they were two years</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:10.140" style="s2">old and were best friends and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.290" end="00:04:11.970" style="s2">what sort of started that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.140" end="00:04:16.200" style="s2">and so Carol and I had been working on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.970" end="00:04:18.540" style="s2">number of things she had started going</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.200" end="00:04:21.270" style="s2">to Charlie Crohn&#39;s sessions and working</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.540" end="00:04:23.580" style="s2">with that group and so she&#39;d bring back</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.270" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">and talk about what she&#39;s doing and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">go out and bring it into my practice and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:29.340" style="s2">so I&#39;ve started it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.229" style="s2">all this was while dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.340" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">family and Jessica and supporting her</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.229" end="00:04:41.669" style="s2">and so it was in the background hovering</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:43.830" style="s2">but not the central focus so the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.669" end="00:04:47.310" style="s2">that I got out of that was there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.830" end="00:04:49.259" style="s2">a saying that that kerchief who&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.310" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2">of one of the key people in fourth way</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.259" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">work which was part of the lineage of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">this work is man cannot do and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:05:00.990" style="s2">really ever understand that until that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">experience and I thought sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.990" end="00:05:08.520" style="s2">with with her I cannot do but I can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:13.469" style="s2">and become something that can make a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.520" end="00:05:16.310" style="s2">difference but I don&#39;t know this reminds</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.469" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">me of the one of my favorite go chief</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.310" end="00:05:23.669" style="s2">quotes is we have to stop thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:26.039" style="s2">ourselves as beings that do and have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.669" end="00:05:28.979" style="s2">start thinking of ourselves as doings</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.039" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">that be and that&#39;s exactly Matthew Fox</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.979" end="00:05:33.270" style="s2">is a similar statement he said we should</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">call ourselves human doings because of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.270" end="00:05:41.330" style="s2">the way we focus yeah so I the month a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:44.819" style="s2">couple of weeks after Jessica died I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.330" end="00:05:50.310" style="s2">went for the first time to actually sit</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.819" end="00:05:55.830" style="s2">in and with Charlie sessions and so it</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.310" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">was it one of the things that it did for</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:06:03.810" style="s2">me was coming in in that place and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:06.060" style="s2">stayed was to be really present with not</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.810" end="00:06:08.460" style="s2">the functional knowledge things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.060" end="00:06:10.770" style="s2">were going on in the session but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.460" end="00:06:13.500" style="s2">energy and the quality of energy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.770" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">being that was present took on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.500" end="00:06:20.009" style="s2">tangibility for me but I had never</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:22.370" style="s2">really experienced before so that was my</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.009" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">entry to this work and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.370" end="00:06:30.990" style="s2">when we talk about what we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:35.849" style="s2">is shifting thinking to him to think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.990" end="00:06:38.520" style="s2">it as an intellectual process and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.849" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">always challenging to people to say and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.520" end="00:06:48.229" style="s2">as an intellectual process</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">is doesn&#39;t have heart it&#39;s abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.229" end="00:06:53.940" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a challenge to for people to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:56.819" style="s2">get over that because we are so firmly</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.940" end="00:07:01.860" style="s2">taught in Western culture the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.819" end="00:07:03.979" style="s2">is about in intellectual exercise it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.860" end="00:07:07.080" style="s2">functional actually a functional process</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.979" end="00:07:12.030" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s how I got involved and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.080" end="00:07:14.849" style="s2">it was it it gave me time to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.030" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">really I think the question I was asking</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.849" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">us what kind of instrument do I need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:23.900" style="s2">be hmm and it took you know a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:26.340" style="s2">years to figure that out I worked with</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.900" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">because the the Institute was focused</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.340" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">around business that was the way to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:33.080" style="s2">involved I&#39;d always been in social</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:38.190" style="s2">causes</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.080" end="00:07:41.340" style="s2">community organizing and so on and this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.190" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">shifted I learned an enormous amount as</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.340" end="00:07:49.800" style="s2">a result of working in business behind a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:51.479" style="s2">serious I could say Mia and good could</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.800" end="00:07:53.580" style="s2">you say a little bit mom as if this was</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.479" end="00:07:58.710" style="s2">the Institute that Johnny Kron ran over</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.580" end="00:08:01.490" style="s2">like yeah Johnny clone sessions if the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.710" end="00:08:10.340" style="s2">there was something called the network</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.490" end="00:08:15.800" style="s2">which was a network of consultants who</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.340" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">worked and learned together from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.800" end="00:08:22.500" style="s2">particular lineage and Charlie was</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:25.319" style="s2">probably there were three three folks</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.500" end="00:08:29.159" style="s2">who were kind of cord of formation of</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.159" end="00:08:34.709" style="s2">described for themselves had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.370" end="00:08:37.529" style="s2">right being right action and right</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.709" end="00:08:39.690" style="s2">knowledge as opposed to hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.529" end="00:08:42.120" style="s2">Charlie&#39;s role was right knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.690" end="00:08:45.480" style="s2">that really was appropriate because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.120" end="00:08:49.589" style="s2">that was his work I mean it&#39;s just it</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.480" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">was continually weaving together</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.589" end="00:08:54.590" style="s2">multiple</p>

<p begin="00:09:03.230" end="00:09:09.050" style="s2">was a very big part of it but his it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.280" end="00:09:11.630" style="s2">right knowledge in the sense of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.050" end="00:09:14.750" style="s2">not a thing known but the process of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.630" end="00:09:18.410" style="s2">knowing I think that&#39;s a really critical</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.750" end="00:09:22.090" style="s2">distinction to make is I think it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.410" end="00:09:25.580" style="s2">of the reasons why this is this work</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.090" end="00:09:28.760" style="s2">feels more resident to indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.580" end="00:09:31.790" style="s2">is that this the understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.760" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">knowledge is knowing a process this</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.790" end="00:09:36.710" style="s2">continuing going is very much more akin</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:41.330" style="s2">than the Western sense of knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.710" end="00:09:42.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a known just fascinating because we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.330" end="00:09:45.560" style="s2">bill and I spoke about this yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.830" end="00:09:48.980" style="s2">that this work is dynamic so on the one</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.560" end="00:09:52.340" style="s2">hand it is completely built on a deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.980" end="00:09:54.590" style="s2">lineage of these people and and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.340" end="00:09:57.350" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly evolving so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.590" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">kind of going back to Bennett M in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.350" end="00:10:02.630" style="s2">sense but always being informed and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">inspired and and revisiting these</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.630" end="00:10:11.900" style="s2">frameworks to then bring them into into</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:15.230" style="s2">a even more appropriate application in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.900" end="00:10:16.670" style="s2">right now right here I think the key</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.230" end="00:10:19.640" style="s2">word in there and what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.670" end="00:10:23.630" style="s2">Daniel is evolving because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.640" end="00:10:26.390" style="s2">tendency in the West to sort of take run</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.630" end="00:10:28.010" style="s2">into some wall or difficulty and say ok</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.390" end="00:10:30.410" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t work anymore we&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.010" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">something else or we want to find our</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.410" end="00:10:33.589" style="s2">own distinctive place and so we give it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:37.460" style="s2">a new name</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.589" end="00:10:40.750" style="s2">and say this is much better I am that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.460" end="00:10:43.670" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this with sustainability now</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.750" end="00:10:45.380" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to see you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.670" end="00:10:48.020" style="s2">suddenly the sustainability isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.380" end="00:10:50.930" style="s2">enough it&#39;s a failure it&#39;s not far</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.020" end="00:10:53.030" style="s2">enough and nobody seems to be asking</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.930" end="00:10:56.120" style="s2">well maybe we didn&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.030" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">what sustainability meant in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.120" end="00:11:00.080" style="s2">of a living world</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">so evolving it you know if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.080" end="00:11:05.899" style="s2">the sciences Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:09.470" style="s2">science far away from Newton but he</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.899" end="00:11:11.570" style="s2">encompassed he didn&#39;t negate what Newton</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.470" end="00:11:15.050" style="s2">found he encompassed it in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.570" end="00:11:18.440" style="s2">picture of understanding and bomb did</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.050" end="00:11:21.709" style="s2">the same thing so I&#39;d like to think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.440" end="00:11:25.579" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with this work is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.709" end="00:11:27.800" style="s2">as it evolves its encompassing in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.579" end="00:11:34.310" style="s2">larger understanding and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.800" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">understanding not changing that but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.310" end="00:11:38.089" style="s2">requires really understanding what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:39.800" style="s2">very worthy it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.089" end="00:11:43.970" style="s2">dynamic like what comes to mind is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.800" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">spiral yeah and like just I mean in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.970" end="00:11:47.510" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s frame it will be called</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:50.870" style="s2">transcend and include rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.510" end="00:11:53.199" style="s2">transcend and exclude to build on it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.870" end="00:11:55.459" style="s2">and also what when you think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.199" end="00:11:58.850" style="s2">developmental pathway as an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.459" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">pathway the entire pathway has to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.850" end="00:12:03.139" style="s2">available to people on the learning</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:04.910" style="s2">journey on their personal development</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.139" end="00:12:08.060" style="s2">journey in order for them to find the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.910" end="00:12:10.130" style="s2">entry point where they&#39;re at and so in</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.060" end="00:12:12.529" style="s2">that sense it is dynamic and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.130" end="00:12:16.010" style="s2">co-present but but there&#39;s always an</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.529" end="00:12:18.740" style="s2">evolving edge and that it pushes it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:21.019" style="s2">a guy and I think not just a spiral but</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.740" end="00:12:24.339" style="s2">it&#39;s actually moving and encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.019" end="00:12:28.250" style="s2">more as it moves up yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.339" end="00:12:30.529" style="s2">exactly right and it I&#39;ve really come to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.250" end="00:12:32.930" style="s2">appreciate the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.529" end="00:12:35.350" style="s2">understanding something which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.930" end="00:12:41.149" style="s2">different from no knowledge about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.350" end="00:12:43.399" style="s2">before I try to evolve or build on it or</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.149" end="00:12:47.829" style="s2">extend it in some way</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.399" end="00:12:51.019" style="s2">you know in in many ways what for us</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.829" end="00:12:53.720" style="s2">evolution is about is it&#39;s an and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.019" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">regeneration is if we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.720" end="00:12:59.569" style="s2">what&#39;s at the core essence of something</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:01.790" style="s2">and we try to improve it we end up</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.569" end="00:13:04.399" style="s2">imposing a pattern we&#39;re bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.790" end="00:13:07.459" style="s2">from somewhere else when we see this has</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.399" end="00:13:12.050" style="s2">happened over and over again in Western</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.459" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">colonial times in science in business in</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.050" end="00:13:16.380" style="s2">the way we plan cities we with the best</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:19.260" style="s2">of intentions</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.380" end="00:13:21.210" style="s2">we are looking to improve but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.260" end="00:13:23.940" style="s2">truly understand what&#39;s at the core</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.210" end="00:13:27.390" style="s2">heart that makes something who and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.940" end="00:13:30.180" style="s2">it is and that&#39;s that&#39;s at the very very</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.390" end="00:13:33.620" style="s2">heart of what what we are working within</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.180" end="00:13:37.770" style="s2">in this particular cosmology and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.620" end="00:13:39.840" style="s2">ontology and technology that makes up</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.770" end="00:13:41.820" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing I find I find it</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.840" end="00:13:46.020" style="s2">fascinating to me personally on two</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.820" end="00:13:47.880" style="s2">levels because on the one hand it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.020" end="00:13:51.480" style="s2">the working with the potential rather</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.880" end="00:13:54.500" style="s2">than the problem working with the like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.480" end="00:13:58.200" style="s2">really being placed sourced and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.500" end="00:14:00.300" style="s2">working with the knowledge that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.200" end="00:14:02.220" style="s2">you do in any place no matter how small</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.300" end="00:14:04.650" style="s2">or how large if you like working by</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.220" end="00:14:05.280" style="s2">originally its core present with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.650" end="00:14:07.920" style="s2">whole world</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.280" end="00:14:11.850" style="s2">so you actually the local world is also</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.920" end="00:14:13.860" style="s2">a global work but then at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.850" end="00:14:18.420" style="s2">as you were saying that I was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.860" end="00:14:23.100" style="s2">tugging on my own master it was landing</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.420" end="00:14:25.080" style="s2">in me also with them since that with</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.100" end="00:14:27.650" style="s2">regard to that long lineage that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.080" end="00:14:30.210" style="s2">just describing what madness has been</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.650" end="00:14:32.780" style="s2">nurtured by people I Charlie crow knew</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.210" end="00:14:36.570" style="s2">Carroll and and people in Regenesis I</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.780" end="00:14:39.270" style="s2">absolutely and joyfully am a humble</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.270" end="00:14:46.920" style="s2">that frame and and and I guess my my</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.910" end="00:14:50.100" style="s2">excitement about wanting to have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.920" end="00:14:54.120" style="s2">conversation before I maybe even fully</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.100" end="00:14:57.390" style="s2">deeply understand it um to the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.120" end="00:15:01.560" style="s2">it is that it&#39;s so strongly resonates</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.390" end="00:15:07.260" style="s2">with the two other main influences in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.560" end="00:15:09.060" style="s2">my own thinking and because and it has a</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.260" end="00:15:11.280" style="s2">each connection because because Henry</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.060" end="00:15:13.860" style="s2">bought oft and his wonderful book agar</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.860" end="00:15:17.910" style="s2">way of science and this almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.010" end="00:15:21.020" style="s2">phenomenological approach that Gerda</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.910" end="00:15:24.450" style="s2">brought in that was reminding us to stay</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.020" end="00:15:27.570" style="s2">present with how we bring the world into</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.450" end="00:15:29.670" style="s2">being how our organizing ideas actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.570" end="00:15:32.270" style="s2">shape what we think is out there but</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.670" end="00:15:38.310" style="s2">it&#39;s not we&#39;ve created it by the way we</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.310" end="00:15:44.130" style="s2">was really really influential for me</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.950" end="00:15:47.160" style="s2">when I was at Omaha college in 2001-2002</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.130" end="00:15:52.590" style="s2">and I worked with Henry directly and</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.180" end="00:16:25.200" style="s2">decision integrity they&#39;re down in</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.250" end="00:16:27.420" style="s2">Pitlochry and and I think you&#39;ll like</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.200" end="00:16:30.590" style="s2">the website so I looked at the website</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.420" end="00:16:33.810" style="s2">and it was Tony Hudson&#39;s website and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.590" end="00:16:35.220" style="s2">Tony is in the IFF that he later invited</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.810" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">me into the international futures for</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.220" end="00:16:40.290" style="s2">him and the connection here is that Tony</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:44.450" style="s2">was in JG Bennett&#39;s research lab the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.290" end="00:16:47.990" style="s2">head of research and Henry who was</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.450" end="00:16:52.080" style="s2">Baum&#39;s PhD student at the back college</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.990" end="00:16:54.450" style="s2">came and worked at Con Springs as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.080" end="00:16:58.860" style="s2">and so both of them in very different</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.450" end="00:17:00.630" style="s2">ways and Tony with his world systems map</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.860" end="00:17:02.400" style="s2">that you can see behind me there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.630" end="00:17:04.020" style="s2">with with the work with three horizons</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.400" end="00:17:06.750" style="s2">and all the frameworks that are curated</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.020" end="00:17:09.089" style="s2">within a ch3 Union and the international</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.750" end="00:17:11.220" style="s2">futures forum gave me so much and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.089" end="00:17:14.190" style="s2">Henry with this particular attention to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.220" end="00:17:16.470" style="s2">our way of seeing being so central and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.190" end="00:17:18.900" style="s2">that that&#39;s why I&#39;m so excited and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.470" end="00:17:20.220" style="s2">a little bit too full of energy to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.900" end="00:17:23.610" style="s2">explore where these</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.220" end="00:17:27.059" style="s2">things can meet um yeah no they do and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.610" end="00:17:33.870" style="s2">mean phenomenology is is another core to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.059" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">this work and it&#39;s I mean I know one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.870" end="00:17:39.419" style="s2">the things that we when we were working</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:41.669" style="s2">on developing Regenesis Charlie was and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.419" end="00:17:44.039" style="s2">bringing it into all of the sessions</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.669" end="00:17:46.740" style="s2">that we folks were involved in with him</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.039" end="00:17:48.840" style="s2">he started using that to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.740" end="00:17:51.150" style="s2">bring people who were much not in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.840" end="00:17:54.750" style="s2">world much more business oriented into</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.150" end="00:17:59.250" style="s2">beginning to experience things from that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.750" end="00:18:02.630" style="s2">level more explicitly and it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.250" end="00:18:05.789" style="s2">term we use often when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.630" end="00:18:08.549" style="s2">storing place and trying to first be the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.789" end="00:18:10.470" style="s2">experience the essence in core what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.549" end="00:18:13.710" style="s2">that what&#39;s the core patterns of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.470" end="00:18:16.350" style="s2">place is to be step in and walk around</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.710" end="00:18:19.470" style="s2">and be conscious of how that place is</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.350" end="00:18:21.750" style="s2">processing us you&#39;re literally being</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.470" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">processed all the time by the places</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.750" end="00:18:26.340" style="s2">it&#39;s another way of saying and this was</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:29.880" style="s2">Charlie&#39;s phrase that he was using with</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.340" end="00:18:33.750" style="s2">the group who was working with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:35.340" style="s2">vineyard a bio dynamic vineyard one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.750" end="00:18:40.130" style="s2">the first ones they were trying to set</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.340" end="00:18:43.020" style="s2">up and he was used that phrases said</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.130" end="00:18:46.380" style="s2">just walk around and observe how its</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.020" end="00:18:50.100" style="s2">processing you now that takes</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.380" end="00:18:53.100" style="s2">consciousness of what&#39;s going on inside</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.100" end="00:18:54.330" style="s2">of us and that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.100" end="00:18:58.250" style="s2">things I actually would like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.330" end="00:19:02.549" style="s2">about Daniel because I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.250" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of exciting and wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.549" end="00:19:08.520" style="s2">things being written now shared</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:10.679" style="s2">disseminated with everywhere around</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.520" end="00:19:13.740" style="s2">things like regenerative agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.679" end="00:19:15.690" style="s2">regenerative economies and so on it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.740" end="00:19:17.370" style="s2">really optimistic and powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.690" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">hopeful time and in all of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.370" end="00:19:24.059" style="s2">happening so it one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:26.039" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been doing is sort of saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.059" end="00:19:28.490" style="s2">okay this is great because when we</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.039" end="00:19:30.990" style="s2">started regeneration had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.490" end="00:19:32.789" style="s2">biology that you couldn&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.990" end="00:19:33.480" style="s2">anywhere else or regenerative brakes</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.789" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.480" end="00:19:40.139" style="s2">in the 90s it was such an obscure sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:43.889" style="s2">of thing so it&#39;s it feels you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.139" end="00:19:46.919" style="s2">finally now taking its place so what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.889" end="00:19:50.429" style="s2">our role and the role of our work in</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.919" end="00:19:54.419" style="s2">this now grew vastly quickly expanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.429" end="00:19:57.809" style="s2">ecosystem where can we uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.419" end="00:19:59.970" style="s2">contribute value in it and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.809" end="00:20:02.880" style="s2">ongoing dialogue with us as part of how</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.970" end="00:20:06.809" style="s2">we work on continuing to evolve what we</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:09.090" style="s2">can bring and as I look it out and read</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.809" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">the thing one of the things that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.090" end="00:20:15.059" style="s2">coming to me is is something you you</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:18.570" style="s2">referred to as sort of self development</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.059" end="00:20:21.000" style="s2">or personal development and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.570" end="00:20:23.880" style="s2">people don&#39;t have when they hear those</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.000" end="00:20:25.620" style="s2">terms they they hear them through the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.880" end="00:20:28.139" style="s2">filter of the way we normally think</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.620" end="00:20:30.389" style="s2">about things like personal development</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.139" end="00:20:32.519" style="s2">or self development and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.389" end="00:20:34.169" style="s2">just address that a little bit because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.519" end="00:20:37.740" style="s2">think that&#39;s one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.169" end="00:20:40.200" style="s2">do that&#39;s and have developed a way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.740" end="00:20:43.769" style="s2">enabling people to work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.200" end="00:20:48.659" style="s2">distinctive to this they say sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.769" end="00:20:51.210" style="s2">starts with the reality that we as</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.659" end="00:21:00.269" style="s2">humans existent in essentially two</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.210" end="00:21:02.820" style="s2">worlds you could say okay so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.269" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">an intrinsic world we live in an</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.820" end="00:21:07.799" style="s2">extrinsic world and they&#39;re always both</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:12.179" style="s2">at the same time and the intrinsic world</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.799" end="00:21:14.460" style="s2">is all about it&#39;s an inner world of and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.179" end="00:21:17.010" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the mental processing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.460" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">goes on in that if we&#39;re aware of it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.010" end="00:21:23.159" style="s2">sort of signals to us who we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:26.279" style="s2">what&#39;s going on how how we want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.159" end="00:21:28.260" style="s2">behave in a situation so on most of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.279" end="00:21:31.980" style="s2">time we&#39;re not even aware of that mental</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.260" end="00:21:34.440" style="s2">processing most of our thinking is about</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.980" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">the extrinsic which is what to do about</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.440" end="00:21:40.830" style="s2">the world up there what we should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:43.260" style="s2">doing in relationship to it the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.830" end="00:21:47.020" style="s2">issue then becomes when we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.260" end="00:21:49.570" style="s2">unconscious of the intrinsic processing</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.020" end="00:21:51.730" style="s2">which is developing how we respond and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.570" end="00:21:55.330" style="s2">engage with the world and we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.730" end="00:21:57.549" style="s2">see that and we&#39;re only looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.330" end="00:21:59.890" style="s2">outside we tend to become reactive</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.549" end="00:22:02.409" style="s2">beings it&#39;s and lead that&#39;s what leads</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.890" end="00:22:05.669" style="s2">to this so emphasis on doing because</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.409" end="00:22:09.100" style="s2">we&#39;re not in Jesus so one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.669" end="00:22:11.559" style="s2">core pieces in this work when we work we</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.100" end="00:22:13.270" style="s2">call it actually is the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.559" end="00:22:16.419" style="s2">process but we&#39;re always working on</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.270" end="00:22:19.690" style="s2">actualization and realization working on</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.419" end="00:22:22.450" style="s2">being able to manifest new effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.690" end="00:22:25.230" style="s2">and capabilities while realizing greater</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.450" end="00:22:27.640" style="s2">potential and never separating those two</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.230" end="00:22:31.299" style="s2">because that&#39;s at the core of that guy</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.640" end="00:22:34.659" style="s2">you were talking about so the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.299" end="00:22:38.860" style="s2">challenge is how do we become conscious</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.659" end="00:22:41.890" style="s2">in the moment of how we are processing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.860" end="00:22:44.230" style="s2">our world and processing our thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.890" end="00:22:46.779" style="s2">ourselves wouldn&#39;t you say that that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.230" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">at the core of personal development like</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.779" end="00:22:50.260" style="s2">ultimately they like even the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:53.470" style="s2">conventional understanding of personal</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.260" end="00:22:58.000" style="s2">development is is leading up to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.470" end="00:23:01.029" style="s2">point where you can feel a reaction</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.000" end="00:23:02.830" style="s2">rising and then you can reflect on how</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.029" end="00:23:05.770" style="s2">your own filters and your own triggers</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.830" end="00:23:09.730" style="s2">have produced that action before you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.770" end="00:23:11.770" style="s2">then respond to the situation I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.730" end="00:23:17.279" style="s2">it&#39;s at the core when it is really truly</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.770" end="00:23:22.120" style="s2">self actualizing but most of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.279" end="00:23:26.590" style="s2">practices for working on that are all</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.120" end="00:23:32.169" style="s2">are about going off and into a retreat</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.590" end="00:23:34.260" style="s2">or meditation or what all in all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.169" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">those are really valuable and important</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.260" end="00:23:39.190" style="s2">processes I don&#39;t want to theirs they</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:42.460" style="s2">they all have a role at different times</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.190" end="00:23:46.299" style="s2">in places what we work on is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.460" end="00:23:49.059" style="s2">actually do use life moment by moment as</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.299" end="00:23:52.120" style="s2">a school for working on that in oneself</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.059" end="00:23:54.820" style="s2">and so it requires more will and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.120" end="00:23:57.010" style="s2">discipline to be able to do that but if</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.820" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">we&#39;re really going to involve who we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.010" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">and our being we have to do it while</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:05.730" style="s2">we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:09.430" style="s2">and so a lot of the practices and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.730" end="00:24:12.040" style="s2">frameworks that we use are and and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.430" end="00:24:15.280" style="s2">kind of working together to support each</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.040" end="00:24:19.000" style="s2">other to be friends in the work this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.280" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">about bringing that into a a meeting at</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.000" end="00:24:25.540" style="s2">work a presentation to a client it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:28.930" style="s2">like how can I bring that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.540" end="00:24:32.410" style="s2">of the inner processes and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.930" end="00:24:35.950" style="s2">affecting the outer and bring them into</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.410" end="00:24:39.670" style="s2">harmony in while I&#39;m striving to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.950" end="00:24:41.950" style="s2">actually do something significant and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.670" end="00:24:45.490" style="s2">certainly is bolstered by meditation</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.950" end="00:24:47.980" style="s2">practices and by retreat practices but</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.490" end="00:24:49.660" style="s2">ultimately that&#39;s where it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.980" end="00:24:53.620" style="s2">be brought to bear if we&#39;re really gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.660" end="00:24:56.560" style="s2">make the change that from doing be human</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.620" end="00:25:00.100" style="s2">doings to human beings I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.560" end="00:25:02.740" style="s2">whether like because as as you were</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.100" end="00:25:04.780" style="s2">speaking about this with regard to how</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.740" end="00:25:07.450" style="s2">you function internally as a team within</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.780" end="00:25:12.580" style="s2">within Regenesis and when you do the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.450" end="00:25:13.900" style="s2">work as a community and I somehow had</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.580" end="00:25:19.290" style="s2">this yes fire</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.900" end="00:25:24.340" style="s2">I always fire his work I I was briefly</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.290" end="00:25:26.140" style="s2">reminded me of the kind of rite of</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.340" end="00:25:30.610" style="s2">passage work of Vision Quest work I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.140" end="00:25:32.200" style="s2">done and the importance of when you come</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.610" end="00:25:35.160" style="s2">back from the mountain and you tell your</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.200" end="00:25:38.140" style="s2">story and of the process of mirroring of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.160" end="00:25:41.110" style="s2">having somebody else reflect what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.140" end="00:25:43.000" style="s2">that the story you tell back to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.110" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">is there any practice that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.000" end="00:25:48.760" style="s2">developed in the team that that when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:52.350" style="s2">when you like how to gently remind</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.760" end="00:25:57.130" style="s2">somebody to take that second second</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.350" end="00:26:00.850" style="s2">level observation of the own practice</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.130" end="00:26:03.860" style="s2">observation you remember you come in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.850" end="00:26:06.170" style="s2">contact with but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.860" end="00:26:08.210" style="s2">sort of core frameworks we introduced at</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.170" end="00:26:13.790" style="s2">the beginning of TRT is three lines of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.210" end="00:26:17.630" style="s2">work yeah of course yeah so the if first</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.790" end="00:26:22.790" style="s2">line work is about developing the self</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.630" end="00:26:24.830" style="s2">to be able to be to fully realize one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.790" end="00:26:27.950" style="s2">potential and I that&#39;s another word</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.830" end="00:26:30.230" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a soft that gets pretty</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.950" end="00:26:34.040" style="s2">flabby but if you sort of think of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.230" end="00:26:37.180" style="s2">potential as the gap between what I am</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.040" end="00:26:39.980" style="s2">now and what I could be if I was fully</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.180" end="00:26:42.700" style="s2">pursuing and realizing my purpose which</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.980" end="00:26:45.680" style="s2">means a contribution to something larger</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.700" end="00:26:49.700" style="s2">so that would be what the actualization</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.680" end="00:26:53.380" style="s2">of if that first line work is a second</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.700" end="00:26:55.640" style="s2">line work I&#39;m taking on stewardship for</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.380" end="00:26:59.230" style="s2">supporting those I&#39;m working with to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.640" end="00:27:03.020" style="s2">also be on that path but always in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.230" end="00:27:05.810" style="s2">relationship to our collective aim of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.020" end="00:27:07.700" style="s2">contributing to something larger and in</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.810" end="00:27:10.220" style="s2">in the world so that&#39;s where we get that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.700" end="00:27:12.290" style="s2">sort of in a sense it&#39;s moving up</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.220" end="00:27:14.210" style="s2">scaling but it&#39;s different from nested</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.290" end="00:27:16.940" style="s2">wholes it&#39;s not the same thing it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.210" end="00:27:18.860" style="s2">but it&#39;s the way we work together and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.940" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole number of practices part</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.860" end="00:27:26.120" style="s2">of it is if you to move a team that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:30.830" style="s2">one of the things we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.120" end="00:27:33.260" style="s2">through TRP and through the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.830" end="00:27:35.390" style="s2">practitioner of course is having study</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.260" end="00:27:37.490" style="s2">cohorts and we&#39;ll be bringing the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.390" end="00:27:42.590" style="s2">thing encouraging it as we start the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.490" end="00:27:46.370" style="s2">co-learning Network next this year is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.590" end="00:27:49.820" style="s2">give people the the support in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.370" end="00:27:52.310" style="s2">structuring second line work groups in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.820" end="00:27:55.040" style="s2">sense even though it may not be in your</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.310" end="00:27:57.890" style="s2">your own team or business but it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.040" end="00:28:00.620" style="s2">lead to that ideally it is but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.890" end="00:28:04.250" style="s2">where you have friends and the work who</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.620" end="00:28:08.060" style="s2">gather together - who have a similar</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.250" end="00:28:09.980" style="s2">understanding and not necessarily all it</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.060" end="00:28:11.780" style="s2">affects better if they&#39;re not all at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.980" end="00:28:13.400" style="s2">same level you always want to sort it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.780" end="00:28:15.790" style="s2">like learning tennis you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.400" end="00:28:17.639" style="s2">practice with somebody better than you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.790" end="00:28:20.450" style="s2">but you also</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.639" end="00:28:22.379" style="s2">by helping along somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.450" end="00:28:26.489" style="s2">resourcing somebody who&#39;s coming along</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.379" end="00:28:29.339" style="s2">behind so having those kinds of groups</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.489" end="00:28:32.429" style="s2">where people are working on their first</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.339" end="00:28:36.119" style="s2">and third line but getting support for</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.429" end="00:28:38.519" style="s2">building the consciousness in from from</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.119" end="00:28:43.139" style="s2">folks who can remind you of ways to work</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.519" end="00:28:46.700" style="s2">together to do that you know we just</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.139" end="00:28:49.950" style="s2">little things I&#39;ll get an example from a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.700" end="00:28:55.529" style="s2">course we ran in Vancouver but this last</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.950" end="00:28:59.369" style="s2">fall we want one of the sort of little</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.529" end="00:29:02.669" style="s2">mantras is that in this work is to start</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.369" end="00:29:04.440" style="s2">from potential not but not problems the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.669" end="00:29:10.259" style="s2">problems were starting from what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.440" end="00:29:14.009" style="s2">the past and by we had a two-day retreat</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.259" end="00:29:16.919" style="s2">at the end of the course and by the end</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.009" end="00:29:19.019" style="s2">of it people were in and these were</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.919" end="00:29:20.909" style="s2">people who just met some of them were</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.019" end="00:29:22.879" style="s2">from the same company but some of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.909" end="00:29:26.969" style="s2">had just met at the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.879" end="00:29:28.919" style="s2">two and a half months they were with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.969" end="00:29:31.499" style="s2">listening to somebody reporting out and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.919" end="00:29:34.950" style="s2">say okay David you&#39;re solving a problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.499" end="00:29:37.619" style="s2">again and they had permission to do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.950" end="00:29:39.779" style="s2">because they were co-learning yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.619" end="00:29:44.029" style="s2">think that&#39;s the key thing it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.779" end="00:29:48.269" style="s2">I&#39;m inviting you in to my development</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.029" end="00:29:50.629" style="s2">and I invite you with the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.269" end="00:29:53.759" style="s2">that we have a similar practice and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.629" end="00:29:55.909" style="s2">respect for each other but I&#39;m inviting</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.759" end="00:30:01.589" style="s2">you to be a friend in the workbook to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.909" end="00:30:04.739" style="s2">and I&#39;m welcome being reminded I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.589" end="00:30:06.179" style="s2">want feedback I want to just have</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.739" end="00:30:09.419" style="s2">something that just sort of wakes me up</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.179" end="00:30:12.179" style="s2">a little bit and makes me be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.419" end="00:30:16.679" style="s2">again of what I&#39;m how I&#39;m processing</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.179" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">myself and in this context how would you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.679" end="00:30:22.079" style="s2">do that sometimes and notice that there</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:25.320" style="s2">is such a specificity of language that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.079" end="00:30:28.139" style="s2">then also in order to very clearly say</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.320" end="00:30:29.459" style="s2">one thing okay it&#39;s in the language</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.139" end="00:30:31.470" style="s2">structure you then create this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.459" end="00:30:34.169" style="s2">the doer do a list opposite</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.470" end="00:30:39.650" style="s2">and that almost creates sort of no no&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.169" end="00:30:45.740" style="s2">like case studies or feedback or and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.650" end="00:30:45.740" style="s2">like how would you distinguish somebody</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.950" end="00:30:53.850" style="s2">kind of be reminding you to stay</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.559" end="00:30:57.210" style="s2">observant of your own processes of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.850" end="00:30:58.919" style="s2">observing and feedback you&#39;re solving a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.210" end="00:31:03.659" style="s2">problem again like boy is isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.919" end="00:31:06.380" style="s2">feedback that as well know if I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.659" end="00:31:10.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;d talked about the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.380" end="00:31:11.580" style="s2">environment the the it was creep we work</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.200" end="00:31:15.020" style="s2">to particular create a particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.580" end="00:31:20.280" style="s2">imagery field people have been through a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.020" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">process and they are struggling to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.280" end="00:31:27.419" style="s2">understand to deepen learning to apply</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:29.490" style="s2">it together and so they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.419" end="00:31:32.940" style="s2">experiencing themselves as being on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.490" end="00:31:37.169" style="s2">learning path and part of this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.940" end="00:31:39.179" style="s2">they&#39;re talking openly about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.169" end="00:31:40.590" style="s2">frameworks that they&#39;re trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.179" end="00:31:44.539" style="s2">into their personal and professional</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.590" end="00:31:47.280" style="s2">lives to to bring consciousness to it to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.539" end="00:31:50.220" style="s2">start to thin see it we&#39;ve we introduced</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.280" end="00:31:52.710" style="s2">you use I know it&#39;s a long time ago and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.220" end="00:31:56.370" style="s2">you had other things on your mind in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.710" end="00:31:59.929" style="s2">therapy but little things like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.370" end="00:32:02.940" style="s2">the scope of our considering am I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.929" end="00:32:04.770" style="s2">internally considering or am I actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.940" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">externally considering and what does</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.770" end="00:32:09.390" style="s2">that mean by internally considering</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:11.880" style="s2">everything relates to me mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.390" end="00:32:13.049" style="s2">you know Daniel you&#39;re frowning I must</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.880" end="00:32:15.929" style="s2">be doing something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.049" end="00:32:18.120" style="s2">yeah now as opposed to Daniel you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.929" end="00:32:20.580" style="s2">frowning can I figure out what it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.120" end="00:32:23.789" style="s2">that&#39;s not working for you and I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.580" end="00:32:26.250" style="s2">support you in now so that builds a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.789" end="00:32:32.010" style="s2">different relationship that has in it</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.250" end="00:32:34.169" style="s2">both explicit and implicit too you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.010" end="00:32:38.309" style="s2">and this was said in a joking way you</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.169" end="00:32:42.750" style="s2">know it was not a chastising but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.309" end="00:32:45.320" style="s2">became a little sort of a wake-up signal</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.750" end="00:32:47.630" style="s2">as a signal as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.320" end="00:32:49.029" style="s2">sitting someone down and saying what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.630" end="00:32:51.289" style="s2">seeing is that you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.029" end="00:32:53.990" style="s2">continuously you step back and you start</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.289" end="00:32:57.740" style="s2">to solve problems and usually feedback</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.990" end="00:32:59.720" style="s2">is followed by advice very hard for</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.740" end="00:33:01.340" style="s2">people I&#39;d watch this over and over</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.720" end="00:33:03.169" style="s2">again to give feedback without then</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.340" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">giving advice because they have an</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.169" end="00:33:08.450" style="s2">answer and what you do is you rob the a</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:12.529" style="s2">the the person you&#39;re engaging with of</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.450" end="00:33:14.450" style="s2">their own agency and that&#39;s the really</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.529" end="00:33:17.019" style="s2">critical piece because that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.450" end="00:33:20.120" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the fundamental base is</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.019" end="00:33:23.720" style="s2">without that personal agency the sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.120" end="00:33:26.539" style="s2">of being able to bring will and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.720" end="00:33:29.299" style="s2">strive to create something that that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.539" end="00:33:33.230" style="s2">uniquely can contribute and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.299" end="00:33:36.889" style="s2">significant it&#39;s you know if I look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.230" end="00:33:39.620" style="s2">equity for example one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.889" end="00:33:43.659" style="s2">definitions I love that came through in</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.620" end="00:33:47.299" style="s2">this work on equity was equity is about</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.659" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">not not an equal starting ground so in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.299" end="00:33:52.370" style="s2">functional material way but equal</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:55.610" style="s2">opportunity to contribute what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.370" end="00:33:57.769" style="s2">uniquely have to contribute and when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.610" end="00:33:59.450" style="s2">start to think about it that way then</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.769" end="00:34:01.700" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to say what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.450" end="00:34:04.250" style="s2">preventing people from bringing their</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.700" end="00:34:07.940" style="s2">unique contribution that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.250" end="00:34:11.179" style="s2">should be working on and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.940" end="00:34:13.490" style="s2">material thing it&#39;s more a path it has</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.179" end="00:34:17.470" style="s2">material implications but it&#39;s more a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.490" end="00:34:20.869" style="s2">path enabling up at that path of the</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.869" end="00:34:26.060" style="s2">full potential and giving opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.109" end="00:34:28.520" style="s2">to be able to think contribute that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.060" end="00:34:32.510" style="s2">potential to things that people care</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.520" end="00:34:34.669" style="s2">about my sense is if we were really</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.510" end="00:34:37.339" style="s2">focusing in on that I look at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.669" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">happening that states and so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.339" end="00:34:46.730" style="s2">people who are who see Trump is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:50.929" style="s2">of a way to justify that they have</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.730" end="00:34:55.970" style="s2">meaning they their value but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.929" end="00:34:58.190" style="s2">it&#39;s an artificial exterior affirmation</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.970" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.190" end="00:35:04.609" style="s2">seeing what&#39;s the real potential they</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:06.500" style="s2">could bring providing infrastructural</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.609" end="00:35:08.930" style="s2">opportunities and learning opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.500" end="00:35:13.670" style="s2">that enable them to actually bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.930" end="00:35:15.980" style="s2">develop and bring that potential is is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.670" end="00:35:18.290" style="s2">world of difference and but we leave</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.980" end="00:35:21.770" style="s2">we&#39;ve created a void because we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.290" end="00:35:24.530" style="s2">that we don&#39;t everybody is having</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.770" end="00:35:28.250" style="s2">unlimited potential how do you see this</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.530" end="00:35:32.960" style="s2">world like with all these like to some</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.250" end="00:35:34.670" style="s2">extent I personally have come being</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.960" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">faced particularly last year with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.670" end="00:35:39.800" style="s2">urgency of the climate crisis and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:42.140" style="s2">trigger points coming in every hard and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.800" end="00:35:46.060" style="s2">fast and in political situations</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.140" end="00:35:48.500" style="s2">worsening and and evil monsters</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.060" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">reappearing that one at four they&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.500" end="00:35:54.200" style="s2">like like all that fascists the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:57.140" style="s2">neo-fascist energy that is suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.200" end="00:36:02.540" style="s2">popping up not just in the US but in</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.140" end="00:36:06.980" style="s2">many other countries and I I almost kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.540" end="00:36:09.349" style="s2">of got to a point of returning to being</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.980" end="00:36:12.589" style="s2">rather than doing and appreciating what</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.349" end="00:36:14.569" style="s2">is and really being with beauty and in</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.589" end="00:36:18.619" style="s2">relationship and trusting that actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.569" end="00:36:22.730" style="s2">that shift because it Repat ins a new</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.619" end="00:36:25.819" style="s2">way of being in the world is it has</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.730" end="00:36:28.339" style="s2">agency in itself and and is is actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.819" end="00:36:30.380" style="s2">at the heart of it because if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.339" end="00:36:32.810" style="s2">respond to the crisis and you frame</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.380" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">everything as a problem and like climate</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.810" end="00:36:38.119" style="s2">change or ecosystems collapse rather</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:43.819" style="s2">than pay attention to where these</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.119" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">symptoms come from you you might miss</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.819" end="00:36:48.760" style="s2">the opportunity to respond appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:51.880" style="s2">but there but but there&#39;s decentest</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.760" end="00:36:55.069" style="s2">strange paradox between urgency and</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.880" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">radical slowing down between global</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.069" end="00:37:01.910" style="s2">problems that could kill large parts of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:04.940" style="s2">life on earth and actually only ever</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.910" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">having one place and one time directed</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.940" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">which is local or by regional and now</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:11.780" style="s2">how do you see all this work all this</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:14.690" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.780" end="00:37:17.510" style="s2">building oldest like baby the sudden</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.690" end="00:37:20.150" style="s2">surge of attention with regard to yes we</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.510" end="00:37:22.670" style="s2">want regenerative futures we want to go</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.150" end="00:37:24.530" style="s2">even beyond just being sustainable or</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.670" end="00:37:27.110" style="s2">they make I agree that the framing of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.530" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">not understanding sustainability as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.110" end="00:37:32.210" style="s2">bridge that we have walked across yet</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:39.410" style="s2">and and and belittling it in any way is</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.210" end="00:37:46.630" style="s2">is the mistaken path but um how do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.410" end="00:37:51.020" style="s2">build this capacity everywhere quick</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.630" end="00:37:53.210" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s thinking functionally</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.020" end="00:37:55.970" style="s2">in in functional scale when you say</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.210" end="00:37:58.220" style="s2">everywhere so let&#39;s let&#39;s back away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.970" end="00:38:03.080" style="s2">a really I think it&#39;s a critical</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.220" end="00:38:05.800" style="s2">question for a time and I was recently</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.080" end="00:38:08.210" style="s2">in a really interesting dialogue with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.800" end="00:38:11.090" style="s2">associate ins and somebody who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.210" end="00:38:13.580" style="s2">moved to a new position it&#39;s has some</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.090" end="00:38:17.420" style="s2">quite a bit of influence and and looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.580" end="00:38:19.100" style="s2">to how to use that that you remember are</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.420" end="00:38:22.280" style="s2">the one of the little frameworks we use</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.100" end="00:38:23.900" style="s2">a lot with law of three mm-hmm and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.280" end="00:38:27.740" style="s2">have to sort of envision this you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.900" end="00:38:30.950" style="s2">one arrow is these three forces so one</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.740" end="00:38:32.840" style="s2">force is usually what&#39;s the activating</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.950" end="00:38:36.980" style="s2">or affirming force what gets something</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.840" end="00:38:41.620" style="s2">started the other force that meets it at</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.980" end="00:38:46.580" style="s2">the same plane is the restraining or</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.620" end="00:38:48.920" style="s2">receptive force receiving force and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.580" end="00:38:52.040" style="s2">like if we live in what Gurjeet called a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.920" end="00:38:54.710" style="s2">two for third force blind world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.040" end="00:38:58.550" style="s2">it we just go back and forth and build</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.710" end="00:39:00.230" style="s2">force or end up compromising down but in</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.550" end="00:39:05.780" style="s2">the three forces there&#39;s a third force</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.230" end="00:39:08.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the reconciling and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.780" end="00:39:11.450" style="s2">one that if we can appreciate both of</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.090" end="00:39:14.410" style="s2">the restraining and the activating force</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.450" end="00:39:17.540" style="s2">hold that cognitive dissonance and</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.410" end="00:39:19.430" style="s2">really appreciate what is the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.540" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">behind each</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.430" end="00:39:25.789" style="s2">the the way this works is that third</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:27.349" style="s2">force comes in he&#39;s like we create space</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.789" end="00:39:31.910" style="s2">for reconciling worse</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.349" end="00:39:34.009" style="s2">so in this dialogue with this friend it</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.910" end="00:39:35.779" style="s2">was we were having this exact dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.009" end="00:39:37.130" style="s2">and he was saying my god he said I hate</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.779" end="00:39:40.039" style="s2">you know I hate it when they say they</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.130" end="00:39:42.710" style="s2">only have 12 years but we only have two</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.039" end="00:39:45.999" style="s2">oh yes but yep this is we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.710" end="00:39:49.700" style="s2">move fast in its so I would say yes and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.999" end="00:39:52.099" style="s2">if we solve it and we are same so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.700" end="00:39:55.849" style="s2">finally sent him a little log three and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.099" end="00:40:03.079" style="s2">I said so on when we have a Christ and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.849" end="00:40:06.950" style="s2">extinction crisis or an existential</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.079" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">crisis which is deals with we just may</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.950" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">destroy ourselves the earth probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:13.999" style="s2">will last after but there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">existential crisis that is getting more</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.999" end="00:40:20.749" style="s2">and more imminent and real</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:24.230" style="s2">we also are right now in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.749" end="00:40:28.460" style="s2">an ontological crisis who do we need to</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.460" end="00:40:34.789" style="s2">what do we need to be working to bring</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.799" end="00:40:38.210" style="s2">into being and so it&#39;s like those if we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.789" end="00:40:42.380" style="s2">solve one without the other if we take</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.210" end="00:40:45.259" style="s2">that moment to just be and be in love</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.380" end="00:40:50.029" style="s2">and in fields of caring and support and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.259" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">we don&#39;t work on the other one then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.029" end="00:40:54.109" style="s2">know we weren&#39;t wearing around to figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:55.970" style="s2">out what our role is supposed to be so</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.109" end="00:40:59.450" style="s2">they really we need to hold them both</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.970" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">and what that requires I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.450" end="00:41:07.099" style="s2">different way that&#39;s why working on our</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:09.769" style="s2">own state as we work out in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.099" end="00:41:12.829" style="s2">so fundamentally critical learning how</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.769" end="00:41:15.489" style="s2">to do that and I&#39;ve been I can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.829" end="00:41:18.710" style="s2">say the number of meetings over the last</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.489" end="00:41:20.420" style="s2">four or five months that we&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.710" end="00:41:22.579" style="s2">planning various things and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.420" end="00:41:26.180" style="s2">just says we&#39;ve got to move faster I</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.579" end="00:41:30.049" style="s2">mean we just we can&#39;t sit around and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.180" end="00:41:32.220" style="s2">minute you go to that state you can no</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.049" end="00:41:34.619" style="s2">long my experiences I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.220" end="00:41:36.869" style="s2">no longer see the whole of what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.619" end="00:41:40.260" style="s2">be worked on in this moment in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.869" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">place or it was in this to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.260" end="00:41:46.200" style="s2">this particular situation so we loose we</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:49.590" style="s2">narrow our consciousness in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.200" end="00:41:54.090" style="s2">and we lose the ability to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.590" end="00:41:57.480" style="s2">on the the crisis that we need to meet</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.090" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">in terms of out there in the world this</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.480" end="00:42:02.609" style="s2">is fascinating because for me and on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">one hand the way you&#39;ve just framed Fred</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.609" end="00:42:07.050" style="s2">this is is like in many ways I feel this</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:11.070" style="s2">very strongly in my own life it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.050" end="00:42:15.890" style="s2">dance between the even the tension</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.070" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">between how much work do I put into</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.890" end="00:42:23.790" style="s2">weaving relationships at the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:25.950" style="s2">scales of nested wholeness and and how</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.790" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">much attention do I put into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.950" end="00:42:33.000" style="s2">immediate look like the local by</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:34.980" style="s2">regional environment and in how much of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.000" end="00:42:37.500" style="s2">that is outlet and how much of that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.980" end="00:42:40.619" style="s2">really inward and nourishing see but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.500" end="00:42:43.500" style="s2">but the then you&#39;re already balancing</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.619" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">that so it really is it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.500" end="00:42:49.830" style="s2">process is one of harmony how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.839" end="00:42:54.390" style="s2">harmonize this you know harmony is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.830" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">all like it&#39;s a good harmony means every</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.390" end="00:43:02.460" style="s2">single element has is playing its role</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">in a beautiful composition so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.460" end="00:43:11.339" style="s2">the opportunity to work regionally to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:14.790" style="s2">what essentially we did for in Regenesis</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.339" end="00:43:16.890" style="s2">we spent years trying out developing</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.790" end="00:43:20.580" style="s2">testing learning coming back and trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.890" end="00:43:23.910" style="s2">out in on the ground and in if I thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.580" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">about the larger scale impact of that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.910" end="00:43:28.470" style="s2">was you know especially in the early</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:31.050" style="s2">years it wasn&#39;t that great until we</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.470" end="00:43:33.240" style="s2">began to realize that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.050" end="00:43:37.080" style="s2">working at both levels and that was when</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.240" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">we set up the Institute as a way instead</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.080" end="00:43:42.470" style="s2">in 2012 started moving towards that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:45.410" style="s2">aspect but you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.470" end="00:43:47.900" style="s2">the podcasts they do the the writing you</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.410" end="00:43:52.700" style="s2">do so you&#39;re you&#39;ve got an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.900" end="00:43:56.299" style="s2">to take that experiential hands-on</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.700" end="00:43:59.329" style="s2">learning extract from it and put it into</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.299" end="00:44:01.010" style="s2">language in ways that reach out and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.329" end="00:44:03.339" style="s2">also have the opportunity that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.010" end="00:44:06.200" style="s2">talk so much about nodal interventions</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.339" end="00:44:08.900" style="s2">you are somebody who started early on</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.200" end="00:44:14.150" style="s2">with an understanding of the importance</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.900" end="00:44:16.339" style="s2">of the nested wholes and scales and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.150" end="00:44:22.760" style="s2">levels of life that&#39;s how life operates</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.339" end="00:44:25.390" style="s2">and you you hit one level and deplete it</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.760" end="00:44:29.890" style="s2">all the other levels eventually collapse</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.390" end="00:44:32.359" style="s2">so all right you know that so you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.890" end="00:44:34.520" style="s2">whatever level you&#39;re working on as long</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.359" end="00:44:37.160" style="s2">as you&#39;re holding that in your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.520" end="00:44:40.579" style="s2">which means unique you can&#39;t collapse</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.160" end="00:44:44.270" style="s2">into the urgency of now the panic that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.579" end="00:44:47.119" style="s2">was really so right but it like one day</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.270" end="00:44:50.569" style="s2">it feels incredibly exhilarating and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.119" end="00:44:52.760" style="s2">exciting and and like a flow and meant</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.569" end="00:44:56.119" style="s2">to be and everything and the other day I</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.760" end="00:44:58.099" style="s2">feel like why am i torturing myself with</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.119" end="00:45:07.329" style="s2">this tension of trying to hold all this</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.099" end="00:45:09.680" style="s2">and John Bennett&#39;s wife there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.329" end="00:45:11.270" style="s2">some discussion about where this saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.680" end="00:45:15.799" style="s2">came from but I think she is actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.270" end="00:45:18.559" style="s2">the one she said that our being attracts</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.799" end="00:45:21.829" style="s2">our life and we only get what we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.559" end="00:45:25.130" style="s2">being is able to manage it&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.829" end="00:45:27.410" style="s2">more elegant way of saying that but if</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.130" end="00:45:30.859" style="s2">you&#39;re it that&#39;s because you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.410" end="00:45:32.990" style="s2">working on growing your state and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.859" end="00:45:35.029" style="s2">what you are capable of handling and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.990" end="00:45:37.940" style="s2">managing and there&#39;s always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.029" end="00:45:39.980" style="s2">that as you&#39;re on that growing edge when</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.940" end="00:45:43.010" style="s2">you talk about the evolving edge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.980" end="00:45:44.539" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s not nobody promised that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.010" end="00:45:47.450" style="s2">was going to be entirely comfortable the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.539" end="00:45:49.190" style="s2">entire but I just wanted to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.450" end="00:45:51.230" style="s2">two things that bridge very beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.190" end="00:45:53.059" style="s2">where we started and where we just got</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.230" end="00:45:56.150" style="s2">to one of them was one year earlier were</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.059" end="00:45:59.240" style="s2">saying that you were describing how you</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.150" end="00:46:02.539" style="s2">white people off into how&#39;s the place</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.240" end="00:46:04.460" style="s2">working on you our pattern Inuit I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.539" end="00:46:08.230" style="s2">I can remember the exact and word you</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.460" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">use process because that&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.230" end="00:46:13.460" style="s2">important forms processes or what</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:15.710" style="s2">transforms something so it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.460" end="00:46:18.710" style="s2">from just any activity well it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.710" end="00:46:20.690" style="s2">a transfer it&#39;s working to shift your</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.710" end="00:46:23.900" style="s2">being at some level and the energies</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.690" end="00:46:27.049" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing that that create a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.900" end="00:46:29.420" style="s2">different state of being and that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.049" end="00:46:31.609" style="s2">kind of reminded me a little bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.420" end="00:46:34.160" style="s2">that flip and perspectives that makes</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.609" end="00:46:35.779" style="s2">such a difference which is again an</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:38.890" style="s2">indigenous insight where indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.779" end="00:46:41.900" style="s2">cultures all over the world have been so</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.890" end="00:46:44.329" style="s2">clear that they belong to the land</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.900" end="00:46:46.700" style="s2">rather than the land could ever belong</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.329" end="00:46:48.740" style="s2">to them so they they are the land the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.700" end="00:46:51.109" style="s2">expressions of the land they are being</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.740" end="00:46:54.109" style="s2">processed constantly by the land their</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.109" end="00:46:56.420" style="s2">language is a process that comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.109" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">the land and in in a similar way when</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.420" end="00:47:01.490" style="s2">you were saying sharing this the sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:03.770" style="s2">of collapsing not being able to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.490" end="00:47:06.890" style="s2">whole when people go into this this</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.770" end="00:47:09.170" style="s2">panic mode of of how we need to move</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.890" end="00:47:11.059" style="s2">faster that this reminds me strongly of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.170" end="00:47:13.910" style="s2">the conversation I had with one of your</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.059" end="00:47:16.579" style="s2">students John Johnny Freelander from</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.910" end="00:47:22.190" style="s2">from New Zealand from the regenerative</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.190" end="00:47:27.170" style="s2">Maori we had this beautiful moment at</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.789" end="00:47:31.069" style="s2">the at the Commonwealth meeting in</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.170" end="00:47:33.170" style="s2">London where I was able to share some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.069" end="00:47:36.109" style="s2">my frameworks and he would then mirror</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.170" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">them from his wisdom tradition</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.109" end="00:47:41.990" style="s2">perspective and and one of these that</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:45.529" style="s2">then was this concept of wow that they</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.529" end="00:47:49.549" style="s2">Bennett speaks about this too with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.180" end="00:47:52.339" style="s2">different hypotheses and so on the co</p>

<p begin="00:48:44.150" end="00:48:50.569" style="s2">insight that no because it&#39;s all energy</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.619" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">in consciousness first that then shows</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.569" end="00:48:53.900" style="s2">up at matter if we have these</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:58.609" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.900" end="00:49:00.500" style="s2">we&#39;re actually happening it like we are</p>

<p begin="00:49:13.730" end="00:49:18.380" style="s2">here&#39;s it&#39;s just one of the things about</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.569" style="s2">getting all this it kind of gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.380" end="00:49:22.609" style="s2">few more years i don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.569" end="00:49:27.160" style="s2">lot more wisdom but a few more years of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.609" end="00:49:32.920" style="s2">experience to reflect back on efforts is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.160" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">that yes that&#39;s true and it does not</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.920" end="00:49:39.530" style="s2">excuse us from continuously working to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:42.859" style="s2">bring more intelligence and more</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.530" end="00:49:46.609" style="s2">understanding to every interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.859" end="00:49:49.069" style="s2">engagement into actually actualizing</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.609" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">something bringing committing to bring</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.069" end="00:49:54.290" style="s2">something into being so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:58.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like a both and that is true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.290" end="00:50:02.450" style="s2">incumbent on us we shift the energy</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.280" end="00:50:04.910" style="s2">field that we is are working in when we</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.450" end="00:50:08.359" style="s2">are able to bring and sustain that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.910" end="00:50:12.290" style="s2">nature of of state and consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.359" end="00:50:16.839" style="s2">it allows them people in that same field</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.290" end="00:50:20.440" style="s2">to shift themselves and so but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.839" end="00:50:23.050" style="s2">good as long as that energy field exists</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.440" end="00:50:24.820" style="s2">when we step out of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.050" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">everybody has had this experience where</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.820" end="00:50:29.860" style="s2">they&#39;ve gone someplace they&#39;ve had an</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:33.850" style="s2">extraordinarily exhilarating experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.860" end="00:50:35.350" style="s2">I mean one of the things that someone we</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.850" end="00:50:38.040" style="s2">work with a lot that you know David</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.350" end="00:50:43.450" style="s2">McConville and David did these</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.040" end="00:50:47.230" style="s2">extraordinary experience all events and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.450" end="00:50:49.570" style="s2">what he realizes he began to get more</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.230" end="00:50:52.930" style="s2">and more into this work was they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.570" end="00:50:55.750" style="s2">ephemeral there were real real changes</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.930" end="00:50:59.070" style="s2">occurred in people in that field but</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.750" end="00:51:03.880" style="s2">it&#39;s ephemeral so that&#39;s why building</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.070" end="00:51:06.490" style="s2">giving learning practices and frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.880" end="00:51:10.510" style="s2">to shape how we see and think about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.490" end="00:51:13.180" style="s2">world is and bringing the will and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.510" end="00:51:16.360" style="s2">discipline to do that is the only way we</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.180" end="00:51:18.010" style="s2">can disrupt these deep patterns and be</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.360" end="00:51:21.370" style="s2">conscious of when those patterns are</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.010" end="00:51:23.380" style="s2">present I mean it&#39;s Krishnamurti one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.370" end="00:51:25.270" style="s2">my favorite closest you may think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.380" end="00:51:26.770" style="s2">thinking your own thoughts you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.270" end="00:51:28.900" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking your cultures thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.770" end="00:51:31.630" style="s2">the most the time we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.900" end="00:51:34.090" style="s2">that we&#39;re not conscious of it that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.630" end="00:51:35.710" style="s2">we&#39;re living out the patterns of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.090" end="00:51:39.430" style="s2">larger culture that we&#39;ve been brought</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.710" end="00:51:43.210" style="s2">in and so I just want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.430" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t I live through the hippy age</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.210" end="00:51:50.550" style="s2">and then through the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:55.930" style="s2">tea groups and and all of that and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.550" end="00:52:01.600" style="s2">just saw so much of a you know drop out</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.930" end="00:52:03.190" style="s2">and be for our children because the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.600" end="00:52:06.280" style="s2">world&#39;s so awful I can&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.190" end="00:52:09.610" style="s2">about it I&#39;m really worried that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.280" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">don&#39;t want to we want to be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.610" end="00:52:14.650" style="s2">this is a rigorous practice that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:16.900" style="s2">called to bring to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.650" end="00:52:19.240" style="s2">consciousness in the moment while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.900" end="00:52:22.150" style="s2">still working on this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.240" end="00:52:25.770" style="s2">existential crisis but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.150" end="00:52:28.870" style="s2">working on who humans can become and be</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.770" end="00:52:32.170" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s and I you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.870" end="00:52:35.890" style="s2">having watched that through the through</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.170" end="00:52:36.790" style="s2">the decades it&#39;s a is an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.890" end="00:52:41.140" style="s2">important up</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.790" end="00:52:43.330" style="s2">Trinity right now for and when I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.140" end="00:52:49.840" style="s2">of what we are being called to step up</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.330" end="00:52:53.500" style="s2">to as a species a role that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.840" end="00:52:57.130" style="s2">really different from even in indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.500" end="00:52:59.380" style="s2">communities it&#39;s got it it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.130" end="00:53:04.690" style="s2">grounded back in that consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.380" end="00:53:07.150" style="s2">sense of always kinship that all is part</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.690" end="00:53:10.030" style="s2">of life even you know we think of rocks</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.150" end="00:53:13.000" style="s2">as inanimate but if you think in terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.030" end="00:53:16.090" style="s2">of the cycle of life they were formed</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.000" end="00:53:18.490" style="s2">out of energy into form they are</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.090" end="00:53:22.440" style="s2">dissolving providing nutrients and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.490" end="00:53:25.660" style="s2">energy into future cycles if we start to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.440" end="00:53:29.800" style="s2">collectively see life in that see that</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.660" end="00:53:32.500" style="s2">sense of multiple time in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.800" end="00:53:34.690" style="s2">what a difference that would make in how</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.500" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">people make decisions in business and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.690" end="00:53:46.390" style="s2">politics in governance policies that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:52.090" style="s2">my vision I think when moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.390" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">that and the jury is out but and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.090" end="00:53:56.710" style="s2">don&#39;t change I mean I think when you say</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:59.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve sort of jumped on that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.710" end="00:54:01.570" style="s2">give everybody the other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.650" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">experienced and this was what I gained</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.570" end="00:54:08.860" style="s2">from working in large corporations part</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.680" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">of the sort of one of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.860" end="00:54:13.780" style="s2">beliefs in this is is the power of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:16.090" style="s2">developing an energy field and how it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.780" end="00:54:18.430" style="s2">begins we&#39;re all we&#39;re always in energy</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.090" end="00:54:21.130" style="s2">fields and they&#39;re shaping us whether</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.430" end="00:54:23.860" style="s2">we&#39;re conscious of them or not</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.130" end="00:54:25.720" style="s2">if we&#39;re in the middle of a mob we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.860" end="00:54:27.940" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very clear that is but</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.720" end="00:54:30.460" style="s2">it&#39;s wherever we are that&#39;s that sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.940" end="00:54:32.230" style="s2">of being processed by a place we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.460" end="00:54:36.490" style="s2">being processed by the energy field of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.230" end="00:54:38.110" style="s2">it and it one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.490" end="00:54:39.670" style="s2">everybody kept saying well who&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.110" end="00:54:44.080" style="s2">around for a long time in the network</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.670" end="00:54:45.400" style="s2">when I joined was the the biggest hazard</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.080" end="00:54:47.080" style="s2">is to feel like you have to touch</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.400" end="00:54:50.920" style="s2">everybody in the corporation to make the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.080" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">change hmm create the field in</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.920" end="00:54:56.859" style="s2">place and others begin to be one drawn</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.400" end="00:54:59.349" style="s2">to it or it begins to kitty carried out</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.859" end="00:55:02.589" style="s2">by those who really can carry that field</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.349" end="00:55:05.980" style="s2">with them and it was quite amazing to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.589" end="00:55:08.619" style="s2">see how and you look at this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.980" end="00:55:11.859" style="s2">major changes of the fall of the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.619" end="00:55:13.690" style="s2">Union there was not everybody got</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.859" end="00:55:16.329" style="s2">touched for the field in the building</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.690" end="00:55:19.690" style="s2">and you get a few lines of communication</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.329" end="00:55:22.809" style="s2">at critical points and suddenly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.690" end="00:55:26.440" style="s2">a step function shift that nobody could</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.809" end="00:55:29.079" style="s2">have predicted and I think we&#39;re at one</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.440" end="00:55:33.910" style="s2">of those points now because there</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.079" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">there&#39;s I&#39;m sure like you do I track you</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.910" end="00:55:37.569" style="s2">know I have a lot of alerts on different</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:42.280" style="s2">terms and so on just to kind of get a</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.569" end="00:55:44.559" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s tracking in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.280" end="00:55:47.079" style="s2">what people are writing about what</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:49.510" style="s2">people are proposing and so on in regard</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.079" end="00:55:55.690" style="s2">to regeneration and everything related</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.510" end="00:55:58.690" style="s2">to it and you know unless we do</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.690" end="00:56:01.299" style="s2">something really stupid like set off a</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.690" end="00:56:06.609" style="s2">nuclear war which our current president</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.299" end="00:56:10.420" style="s2">is capable of unfortunately I my sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.609" end="00:56:15.640" style="s2">is that it&#39;s going to shift in ways we</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.420" end="00:56:21.730" style="s2">have no idea yeah this I mean that this</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.640" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">reminds me of lost then I&#39;d you enter</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.730" end="00:56:29.320" style="s2">earlier was was the personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:31.690" style="s2">of death and transcendence and likely of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.320" end="00:56:34.000" style="s2">understanding that death is part of life</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.690" end="00:56:35.530" style="s2">really brought you into this work for me</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.000" end="00:56:37.750" style="s2">that was one of the big insights when I</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.700" end="00:56:49.270" style="s2">regenerative Enterprise and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.230" end="00:56:52.060" style="s2">that was just such a brilliant question</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.270" end="00:56:55.450" style="s2">that our culture is blind to and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.060" end="00:56:57.880" style="s2">actively avoids um and and and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.450" end="00:57:00.460" style="s2">there&#39;s this the sense of also they like</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.880" end="00:57:02.890" style="s2">Lea&#39;s remind of Brian Goodwin one of my</p>

<p begin="00:57:11.650" end="00:57:18.430" style="s2">which is speaking very strongly to this</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.330" end="00:57:20.380" style="s2">what what needs to die in me or bill was</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.430" end="00:57:22.510" style="s2">sharing yesterday that that Regenesis</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.380" end="00:57:26.440" style="s2">group has these these meetings where you</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.510" end="00:57:30.700" style="s2">actually declare like you put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.440" end="00:57:36.070" style="s2">to death in order to be reborn it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.700" end="00:57:42.300" style="s2">wonderful practice and as we wait to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.070" end="00:57:45.220" style="s2">Janis generation yeah how do we really</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.300" end="00:57:47.320" style="s2">need to invite people to embrace some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.220" end="00:57:51.880" style="s2">the breakdown chaos and collapse that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.320" end="00:57:53.920" style="s2">now all around us as as the unleashing</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.880" end="00:57:56.020" style="s2">of the potential like even you can frame</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.920" end="00:57:57.940" style="s2">it on in complex systems terms and a</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.020" end="00:58:00.430" style="s2">complex dynamic system is most creative</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.940" end="00:58:02.130" style="s2">at the edge of chaos when most of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.430" end="00:58:05.950" style="s2">structures that no longer serve and</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.130" end="00:58:07.720" style="s2">anachronistic have broken down and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.950" end="00:58:10.200" style="s2">fragile then but at the same time it has</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.720" end="00:58:15.340" style="s2">all the potential for reorganization and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.200" end="00:58:19.650" style="s2">in bringing evolution and so I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.340" end="00:58:19.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s where we at and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.420" end="00:58:32.619" style="s2">yeah the ways we hold regeneration is go</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.820" end="00:58:35.200" style="s2">right back to its you know I&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.619" end="00:58:37.869" style="s2">lot of definitions renewal</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:40.960" style="s2">Riis restoration and so on sort of as</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.869" end="00:58:43.030" style="s2">the same thing regeneration is about</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.960" end="00:58:45.190" style="s2">going back to the source of generation</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.030" end="00:58:48.250" style="s2">what&#39;s what was the source of the birth</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.190" end="00:58:51.700" style="s2">of something mm-hmm and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.250" end="00:58:55.000" style="s2">essence that that and then in bring more</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.700" end="00:58:56.950" style="s2">life to it so we&#39;re we&#39;re bringing more</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.000" end="00:59:02.170" style="s2">life to what is so in a sense acai</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.950" end="00:59:04.570" style="s2">giving up what we are is to discover who</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.170" end="00:59:07.480" style="s2">we really are</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.570" end="00:59:12.970" style="s2">in what&#39;s really our unique essence and</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.480" end="00:59:19.570" style="s2">I this is if we don&#39;t have that as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.970" end="00:59:21.760" style="s2">core fundamental in a census it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.570" end="00:59:23.710" style="s2">the cosmology is a part of it as how</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.760" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">that everything in the universe has its</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.710" end="00:59:28.510" style="s2">own unique essence pattern this is bone</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:33.400" style="s2">I mean this is really straight his</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.510" end="00:59:37.440" style="s2">signings and it&#39;s an ancient belief</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.400" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">system but it bones work in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.440" end="00:59:44.560" style="s2">implicit order is the pattern of essence</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.440" end="00:59:47.140" style="s2">that&#39;s constantly informing how things</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.560" end="00:59:50.020" style="s2">get manifested in in the explicate order</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.140" end="00:59:52.660" style="s2">but above that is the super to implicit</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.020" end="00:59:56.500" style="s2">which is the sort of more unfettered</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.660" end="00:59:59.740" style="s2">energies that inform that essence so can</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.500" end="01:00:03.730" style="s2">we begin to go all have access to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.740" end="01:00:05.230" style="s2">whole scale and bring it forward in</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.730" end="01:00:06.430" style="s2">terms of how we&#39;re working and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.230" end="01:00:09.880" style="s2">understanding and the consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.430" end="01:00:14.109" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to bring we&#39;ll see a lot</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.880" end="01:00:16.660" style="s2">less of this trying to imprint on others</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.109" end="01:00:19.240" style="s2">what we think is what progress and what</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.660" end="01:00:24.430" style="s2">needs to happen we really deeply</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.240" end="01:00:28.510" style="s2">appreciate that and strive to understand</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.430" end="01:00:31.810" style="s2">and care about the the essence of each</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.510" end="01:00:37.569" style="s2">of us holes I reach every city every</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.810" end="01:00:39.750" style="s2">neighborhood every community that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:00:39.750" end="01:00:42.880" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.990" end="01:00:45.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what I use as a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.880" end="01:00:49.390" style="s2">catch catchphrase to run through my book</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.610" end="01:00:55.270" style="s2">and it feel feels very akin to just</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.390" end="01:00:58.810" style="s2">staying willing to yeah to manifest the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.270" end="01:01:02.560" style="s2">potential that lies in life as a like</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.810" end="01:01:06.330" style="s2">Alfred North Whitehead the continuous</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.560" end="01:01:09.400" style="s2">exploration of novelty but but with a</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.330" end="01:01:12.940" style="s2">with a clap to the essence of what wants</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.400" end="01:01:17.500" style="s2">to be expressed like you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.940" end="01:01:22.330" style="s2">talking about indigenous cultures and</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.500" end="01:01:25.450" style="s2">belief systems and ways the mind deloria</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.330" end="01:01:28.630" style="s2">who I&#39;m sure you know was just an</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.450" end="01:01:31.060" style="s2">amazing person and one of the things he</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.630" end="01:01:33.550" style="s2">has a book on where he talks about</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.060" end="01:01:38.890" style="s2">education he and Daniel was like at and</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.550" end="01:01:40.750" style="s2">the what he speaks to is that we you</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.890" end="01:01:44.140" style="s2">need to always start education starting</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.750" end="01:01:47.050" style="s2">with philosophy and we don&#39;t in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.140" end="01:01:49.360" style="s2">Western where we start with our</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.050" end="01:01:52.630" style="s2">philosophy or a belief system are</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.360" end="01:01:56.410" style="s2">embedded and hidden so we start with</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.630" end="01:01:58.420" style="s2">what needs to be done and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.410" end="01:02:00.610" style="s2">where we run into these things so I</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.420" end="01:02:04.450" style="s2">think it&#39;s part of this is in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.610" end="01:02:09.700" style="s2">urgency of now of becoming conscious and</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.450" end="01:02:13.420" style="s2">creating the the seedbed for coalescence</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.700" end="01:02:16.690" style="s2">and and harmony is to start sharing more</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.420" end="01:02:18.940" style="s2">more openly what is the source of our</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.690" end="01:02:21.700" style="s2">beliefs about this why why do we believe</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.940" end="01:02:23.560" style="s2">that what&#39;s the philosophy that&#39;s behind</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.700" end="01:02:25.290" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do and the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.560" end="01:02:28.390" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do it right now and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.290" end="01:02:31.510" style="s2">those kinds of conversations having them</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.390" end="01:02:35.200" style="s2">in those moments of we got to get moving</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.510" end="01:02:38.860" style="s2">if we can take the discipline to say why</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.200" end="01:02:44.170" style="s2">and and get to that fundamental belief</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.860" end="01:02:46.870" style="s2">in philosophy level not in vast world</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.170" end="01:02:50.710" style="s2">sense but right here right now in terms</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.870" end="01:02:52.870" style="s2">of what we&#39;re arguing about in New</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.710" end="01:02:55.660" style="s2">Mexico about how do we actually phase</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.870" end="01:02:56.170" style="s2">out a coal plant and all the jobs that</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.660" end="01:03:00.460" style="s2">are</p>

<p begin="01:03:00.460" end="01:03:06.610" style="s2">we can work argue about the large issues</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.970" end="01:03:10.120" style="s2">like global warming and so on or we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.610" end="01:03:12.430" style="s2">start with what are we what we really</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.120" end="01:03:15.130" style="s2">believe is right and good to do here</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.430" end="01:03:16.870" style="s2">each of us and what&#39;s our philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.130" end="01:03:20.770" style="s2">there Brett and can we start to see how</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.870" end="01:03:22.720" style="s2">those can come together hmm we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.770" end="01:03:27.400" style="s2">have those kinds of conversations very</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.720" end="01:03:29.060" style="s2">often I do feel that there is a shift</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.400" end="01:03:31.710" style="s2">though that even in</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.060" end="01:03:35.170" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.710" end="01:03:37.120" style="s2">contexts like like government offices or</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.170" end="01:03:39.820" style="s2">large corporations it is much more</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.120" end="01:03:41.200" style="s2">possible to at least bring in this</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.820" end="01:03:44.380" style="s2">conversation where they act on it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.200" end="01:03:47.230" style="s2">another is another question but but</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.380" end="01:03:48.940" style="s2">people are kind of seeing that they need</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.230" end="01:03:52.660" style="s2">a new approach to need a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.940" end="01:03:54.940" style="s2">different way of yeah no I agree I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.660" end="01:03:57.670" style="s2">it is happening and we&#39;re Petaling like</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.940" end="01:04:02.170" style="s2">mad to help support that happen and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.670" end="01:04:03.670" style="s2">think it is what will enable us I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.170" end="01:04:06.100" style="s2">this is where I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.670" end="01:04:08.830" style="s2">resonances with the powerful experience</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.100" end="01:04:11.530" style="s2">of indigenous communities is when they</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.830" end="01:04:15.670" style="s2">are intact you grow up in a whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.530" end="01:04:17.230" style="s2">cosmology and ontology and then so in</p>

<p begin="01:04:38.770" end="01:04:44.830" style="s2">cultural piece is really critical and we</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.580" end="01:04:47.110" style="s2">one of things we also work on people</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.830" end="01:04:49.870" style="s2">being able to be more explicit and</p>

<p begin="01:05:08.850" end="01:05:15.720" style="s2">PhD work I was speaking a lot about how</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.210" end="01:05:19.560" style="s2">design goes on designing and how when we</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.720" end="01:05:21.780" style="s2">live in a city and we might put like</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.560" end="01:05:25.560" style="s2">fiberglass and and like new wires and</p>

<p begin="01:05:27.120" end="01:05:32.820" style="s2">through that space you&#39;re still informed</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.160" end="01:05:35.510" style="s2">by some design decisions and frameworks</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.820" end="01:05:38.280" style="s2">that are 200-300 years old</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.510" end="01:05:40.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why ontological design is such a</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.280" end="01:05:42.930" style="s2">powerful way of thinking about that</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.440" end="01:05:45.030" style="s2">because we don&#39;t we all the design</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.930" end="01:05:47.210" style="s2">thinking and everything else is to get</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.030" end="01:05:51.000" style="s2">the end product for the moment with</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.210" end="01:05:54.650" style="s2">Vicki it goes on designing its world for</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.000" end="01:05:57.210" style="s2">a long long time you&#39;re absolutely right</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.650" end="01:05:59.850" style="s2">well this has been wonderful I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.210" end="01:06:00.990" style="s2">conscious that I don&#39;t want to take up</p>

<p begin="01:06:00.990" end="01:06:07.440" style="s2">um but yeah thank you so much for this</p>

<p begin="01:06:17.130" end="01:06:23.700" style="s2">more people and in his beginning of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.380" end="01:06:25.950" style="s2">conversation and assuming because I</p>

<p begin="01:06:25.950" end="01:06:33.330" style="s2">and lift up was one dimension of our</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.320" end="01:06:35.970" style="s2">work and I&#39;m assuming that bill and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.330" end="01:06:38.310" style="s2">others that you will will pick up the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.970" end="01:06:42.620" style="s2">other dimensions because I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.310" end="01:06:44.940" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it can it can get really</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.620" end="01:06:47.820" style="s2">kind of straight like I keep hearing</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.940" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">people talking about we do mental model</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.820" end="01:06:52.980" style="s2">trainings we never use the word training</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:56.850" style="s2">and we don&#39;t a mental model is somebody</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.980" end="01:07:00.030" style="s2">else&#39;s explanation it&#39;s not a means to</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.850" end="01:07:03.660" style="s2">be able to build one&#39;s own so I wanna if</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.030" end="01:07:04.320" style="s2">we can just keep working away yeah no</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.660" end="01:07:05.970" style="s2">I&#39;m fine</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.320" end="01:07:08.010" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m starting this</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.970" end="01:07:10.080" style="s2">learning journey it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.010" end="01:07:12.750" style="s2">wonderful way of learning myself and</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.080" end="01:07:15.900" style="s2">then sharing the learning with other</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.750" end="01:07:17.600" style="s2">people they will hear what we said</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.900" end="01:07:20.590" style="s2">differently than we heard what we said</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.600" end="01:07:23.530" style="s2">but but yeah I&#39;m looking forward to</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.590" end="01:07:25.660" style="s2">this this multifaceted perspective on</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.530" end="01:07:27.280" style="s2">working the one thing that we maybe pick</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.660" end="01:07:31.120" style="s2">up some other time is is this question</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.280" end="01:07:33.100" style="s2">of now that there&#39;s such a buzz around</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.120" end="01:07:34.750" style="s2">regeneration like I mentioned this</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.100" end="01:07:37.720" style="s2">briefly with Bill yesterday as well like</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.750" end="01:07:43.930" style="s2">how do you avoid because so many people</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.720" end="01:07:46.900" style="s2">are now taking bits from whatever is out</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.930" end="01:07:49.000" style="s2">there already repackaging it in a clever</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.900" end="01:07:50.740" style="s2">way in the way that they&#39;ve always done</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.000" end="01:07:53.320" style="s2">that as consultants to just make</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.740" end="01:07:56.290" style="s2">something buzz worthy and the new thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.320" end="01:07:57.730" style="s2">and and then go out there and say sure I</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.290" end="01:08:00.460" style="s2">can help you become a regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.730" end="01:08:02.140" style="s2">cooperation and and on the one hand</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.460" end="01:08:03.340" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s exciting that at least the</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.140" end="01:08:05.140" style="s2">words out there and people are</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.340" end="01:08:08.140" style="s2">interested in it and it&#39;s begin it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.140" end="01:08:12.760" style="s2">opening a much wider wedge for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.140" end="01:08:14.560" style="s2">conversation but how do we bring invite</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.760" end="01:08:17.109" style="s2">people into a process of deepening that</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.560" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">even if it&#39;s just a small percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.109" end="01:08:21.670" style="s2">those people who are now tuning into</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:24.730" style="s2">this frequency realize that this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.670" end="01:08:25.899" style="s2">actually committing to a long practice</p>
