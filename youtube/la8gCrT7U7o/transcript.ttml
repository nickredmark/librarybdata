<p begin="00:00:03.799" end="00:00:15.300" style="s2">hi everyone welcome to the October</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.410" end="00:00:17.130" style="s2">version of the QA hopefully all my</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.300" end="00:00:28.050" style="s2">technology will work it&#39;s amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.130" end="00:00:30.569" style="s2">it ever does QA Oh apparently it is good</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.050" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">so let me catch you up to date on some</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.569" end="00:00:35.370" style="s2">news first that would be fun as far as</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:37.530" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned so the first thing I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.370" end="00:00:42.980" style="s2">to do is share something with you and</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.530" end="00:00:47.310" style="s2">that&#39;s this so I got this in the mail</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.980" end="00:00:49.080" style="s2">yesterday from penguin UK from an editor</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.310" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">Nick Skidmore who I&#39;ve been working with</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.080" end="00:00:56.310" style="s2">for several months and so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:59.190" style="s2">50th anniversary version of Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.310" end="00:01:01.410" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn &#39;s Gulag Archipelago in its</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.190" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">abridged form one volume of bridged form</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.410" end="00:01:08.399" style="s2">which he approved it&#39;s also published on</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">the sent in their centenary of his birth</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.399" end="00:01:14.490" style="s2">and I was invited to write a foreword to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:16.079" style="s2">it which I completed and which seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.490" end="00:01:18.630" style="s2">meet with the satisfaction of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.079" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">editors and also Solzhenitsyn&#39;s family</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.630" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">it&#39;s about 500 pages long which is much</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:28.399" style="s2">shorter than the original book which was</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">about eighteen hundred pages and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.399" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn approved the abridgement I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.329" end="00:01:35.069" style="s2">think I might have said that so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">remarkable piece of literature and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.069" end="00:01:41.639" style="s2">history and arguably the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:43.409" style="s2">influential historical document of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.639" end="00:01:47.219" style="s2">20th century you could make that case</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.409" end="00:01:48.959" style="s2">and so it was really unbelievably it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.219" end="00:01:50.429" style="s2">an unbelievable privilege to be asked to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.959" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">write the foreword and I hope that I did</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.429" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">a credible job we&#39;ll see about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:01:58.349" style="s2">on sale as of November 1st now I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:01:59.999" style="s2">prepared a youtube video for it where</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.349" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">I&#39;ve read the foreword and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.999" end="00:02:03.959" style="s2">content of the book to provide people</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:06.029" style="s2">with an introduction and I&#39;m hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.959" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">this will be something approximating a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.029" end="00:02:11.600" style="s2">literary event so I invite you to pick</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:14.020" style="s2">up the book if you&#39;d like to and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.600" end="00:02:16.870" style="s2">prepare to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.020" end="00:02:20.050" style="s2">shock to your core I suppose is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.870" end="00:02:20.620" style="s2">proper way of thinking about it so there</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.050" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">you go</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.620" end="00:02:27.570" style="s2">so that&#39;s that next thing I was in New</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:30.970" style="s2">York the other day yesterday literally</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.570" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2">finalizing what I hope is a deal for my</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.970" end="00:02:35.140" style="s2">second book and perhaps books after that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:39.100" style="s2">but certainly for the second book which</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.140" end="00:02:42.780" style="s2">is tentatively entitled 12 more rules</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.100" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">for life there you go</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.780" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">originally there were 42 rules and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.590" end="00:02:57.850" style="s2">haven&#39;t used them all up so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.810" end="00:02:59.110" style="s2">plenty of reason for continuing as far</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.850" end="00:03:00.880" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned and I&#39;ve written a fair</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.110" end="00:03:03.910" style="s2">bit of it and it seems to be going well</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.880" end="00:03:05.470" style="s2">and I&#39;m hoping that I can do a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.910" end="00:03:06.820" style="s2">job of the second book that&#39;s the goal</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.470" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I discussed with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.820" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">editorial team is that I want the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:15.460" style="s2">book to be substantially better than the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">last one was hopefully I can manage that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.460" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s well and good as well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.670" end="00:03:23.320" style="s2">hoping that I&#39;d have that book done by</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:25.810" style="s2">next September something approximating</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.320" end="00:03:27.850" style="s2">that maybe for publication the following</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.810" end="00:03:29.950" style="s2">January now I&#39;ve got a year after that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.850" end="00:03:32.220" style="s2">if I need it depending on what happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.950" end="00:03:34.360" style="s2">this year but that&#39;s the plan and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.220" end="00:03:40.230" style="s2">I&#39;m going to tell you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.360" end="00:03:43.180" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with me over the next I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.230" end="00:03:44.470" style="s2">suppose year really I might as well tell</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.180" end="00:03:46.420" style="s2">you that maybe you&#39;re you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.470" end="00:03:49.270" style="s2">interested in knowing so the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.420" end="00:03:51.670" style="s2">is is that tonight I&#39;m going with Tammy</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.270" end="00:03:53.590" style="s2">my wife who&#39;s been traveling me with me</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.670" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">this whole time we&#39;ve we&#39;ve finished 85</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:03:58.270" style="s2">cities in the tour so far and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:04:00.580" style="s2">gone really well I would say so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.270" end="00:04:02.320" style="s2">spoken to about 250,000 people I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.580" end="00:04:03.940" style="s2">travelling with Dave Rubin of the Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.320" end="00:04:07.390" style="s2">report and that&#39;s been entertaining he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.940" end="00:04:09.010" style="s2">very comical and has been a good adjunct</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.390" end="00:04:11.050" style="s2">to add a bit of levity and also a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.010" end="00:04:14.410" style="s2">certain degree of seriousness so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.050" end="00:04:17.650" style="s2">good so on Sunday I&#39;m speaking in Dublin</p>

<p begin="00:04:53.889" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">dr. oz again that&#39;s not finalized but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.990" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">seems probable then I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:02.500" style="s2">Washington to talk to some people there</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:04.210" style="s2">and then to Florida for a bit of a break</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.500" end="00:05:06.310" style="s2">from Canadian winter even though I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.210" end="00:05:09.640" style="s2">have experienced any of that so far this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.310" end="00:05:12.070" style="s2">year and I have a speaking engagement</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.640" end="00:05:15.190" style="s2">there as well and then in January</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.070" end="00:05:19.150" style="s2">possibly I&#39;ll be in California we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.190" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">applied for a tech incubator in</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.150" end="00:05:24.700" style="s2">California to further the development of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:27.100" style="s2">our educational software which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.700" end="00:05:29.260" style="s2">already at the prototype stage I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.100" end="00:05:31.180" style="s2">know for sure that will be accepted into</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.260" end="00:05:33.460" style="s2">the incubator and I don&#39;t know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.180" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">if we are accepted if that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.460" end="00:05:36.520" style="s2">route we&#39;re going to take because there</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:39.729" style="s2">are other options we&#39;re also working</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.520" end="00:05:43.150" style="s2">with a private school consortium to test</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.729" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">the software as we develop it because</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.150" end="00:05:46.090" style="s2">when you&#39;re developing a product this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">a good thing to know if you ever do</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.090" end="00:05:49.660" style="s2">build something you want to build a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:51.310" style="s2">product test it with your potential</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.660" end="00:05:52.870" style="s2">customers build it again because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.310" end="00:05:55.470" style="s2">made all sorts of mistakes test it with</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.870" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">your customers and so on so and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.470" end="00:06:00.669" style="s2">after that I&#39;m going to Australia and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:02.470" style="s2">New Zealand probably to talk in about a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.669" end="00:06:04.630" style="s2">dozen places there and then back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.470" end="00:06:07.030" style="s2">Europe in March and April and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.630" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">going to write non-stop I hope from May</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.030" end="00:06:10.990" style="s2">to September and then with any luck I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.370" end="00:06:13.900" style="s2">going to start the biblical series again</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.990" end="00:06:14.950" style="s2">with Exodus and so that&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.900" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">the plan</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.950" end="00:06:22.840" style="s2">so it&#39;s exciting and daunting and all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:26.440" style="s2">those things so now you&#39;re up to date</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.840" end="00:06:29.800" style="s2">and hopefully that was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.440" end="00:06:31.479" style="s2">I really am thrilled about this this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.800" end="00:06:36.190" style="s2">really something man it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.479" end="00:06:38.380" style="s2">something so and I&#39;m the solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.190" end="00:06:40.760" style="s2">family was happy with the forward so</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.380" end="00:06:45.750" style="s2">that was really</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.760" end="00:06:47.190" style="s2">positive and hopefully it&#39;ll bring a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.750" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">whole new audience to the book that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.190" end="00:06:49.770" style="s2">would be a good thing this is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:56.220" style="s2">something that we should ever forget</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.770" end="00:07:00.660" style="s2">ever okay so let&#39;s say let&#39;s go to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.220" end="00:07:03.180" style="s2">questions here any advice for a young</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.660" end="00:07:04.680" style="s2">counselor soon to finish his degree what</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.180" end="00:07:08.060" style="s2">do you wish you knew as a young</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.680" end="00:07:10.620" style="s2">therapist well let&#39;s start with advice</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.060" end="00:07:13.080" style="s2">well one thing I would say is you could</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.620" end="00:07:15.780" style="s2">go to my book list and read the books</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.080" end="00:07:18.180" style="s2">that are there there&#39;s at on my website</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.780" end="00:07:21.390" style="s2">there is a list of recommended books</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.180" end="00:07:22.830" style="s2">fiction nonfiction and the nonfiction is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.390" end="00:07:25.860" style="s2">categorized in different ways there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.830" end="00:07:28.140" style="s2">psychotherapy section I would say read</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.860" end="00:07:32.430" style="s2">those books that&#39;s that would be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.140" end="00:07:34.620" style="s2">those people young Freud Rogers I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.430" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">there&#39;s something by Adler unreel and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.620" end="00:07:40.830" style="s2">bur J some of the existentialists from</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:43.260" style="s2">the 1950s a lot of neuroscientists</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.830" end="00:07:46.280" style="s2">types very very smart people very very</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.260" end="00:07:49.950" style="s2">useful to know what they had to say so</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.280" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">then the next thing I would suggest and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.950" end="00:07:55.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard this from me before perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:59.760" style="s2">is that it&#39;s almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.800" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">overestimate the degree to which merely</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.760" end="00:08:04.200" style="s2">listening is helpful if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:06.390" style="s2">counselor lots of people have no one to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.200" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">listen to have no one that will listen</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.390" end="00:08:10.410" style="s2">to them and that&#39;s a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:12.860" style="s2">because people actually think by talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.410" end="00:08:15.000" style="s2">and so for many people who are isolated</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.860" end="00:08:16.440" style="s2">they have no one to talk to so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.000" end="00:08:18.570" style="s2">means they don&#39;t think and that means</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.440" end="00:08:21.750" style="s2">that their their thoughts aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.570" end="00:08:25.110" style="s2">straight and organized and you might</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.750" end="00:08:28.050" style="s2">think well why does that matter but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.110" end="00:08:32.630" style="s2">reason it matters is because the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.050" end="00:08:35.160" style="s2">analogy I would say to do thoughts is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.630" end="00:08:36.360" style="s2">that the best way of conceptualizing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.160" end="00:08:39.540" style="s2">structure of your thoughts is to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:43.500" style="s2">consider it in the same manner that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.540" end="00:08:45.030" style="s2">might consider a map and your map should</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.500" end="00:08:46.500" style="s2">be organized and things should be in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.030" end="00:08:48.630" style="s2">right place because otherwise when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.500" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">use the map to navigate in the world you</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.630" end="00:08:52.890" style="s2">don&#39;t end up where you want to be and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">you run into things that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.890" end="00:08:55.290" style="s2">to encounter</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.569" style="s2">and so it&#39;s actually extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.290" end="00:09:00.209" style="s2">necessary to get your thoughts in order</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.569" end="00:09:02.509" style="s2">since they help you simulate the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.209" end="00:09:05.189" style="s2">before you act in it and so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.509" end="00:09:07.170" style="s2">underestimate how important it is just</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.189" end="00:09:08.970" style="s2">to listen and then you think let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.170" end="00:09:09.959" style="s2">about listening to so someone comes to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.970" end="00:09:11.490" style="s2">you and they and they come to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.959" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">because they have a problem now you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.490" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know what their problem is and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:16.829" style="s2">neither do they all you know is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:19.259" style="s2">they have enough of a problem to come</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.829" end="00:09:21.209" style="s2">and talk to you so then they might have</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.259" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">a problem because really terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.209" end="00:09:25.079" style="s2">have happened to them and anyone with</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">any sense would have a problem and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.079" end="00:09:29.430" style="s2">then they have problems in lives in life</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">say or they have existential problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.430" end="00:09:33.259" style="s2">don&#39;t really psychological problems even</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:36.899" style="s2">though it might be psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.259" end="00:09:38.670" style="s2">demanding to adapt to the real problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.899" end="00:09:40.709" style="s2">you want to listen and you want to find</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.670" end="00:09:43.829" style="s2">out well what exactly is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.709" end="00:09:45.990" style="s2">space and how much of that is practical</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.829" end="00:09:48.750" style="s2">and how much of it is psychological so</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.990" end="00:09:51.000" style="s2">the first issue is you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.750" end="00:09:52.769" style="s2">the problem is and you want to ask a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.000" end="00:09:55.860" style="s2">of questions to find out what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.769" end="00:09:57.750" style="s2">and and also what it isn&#39;t because often</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.860" end="00:10:00.180" style="s2">people will come in and they&#39;re upset</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.750" end="00:10:02.069" style="s2">and they don&#39;t exactly know why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.180" end="00:10:04.230" style="s2">upset and they might be upset about a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.069" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">whole bunch of things and it isn&#39;t until</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.230" end="00:10:08.430" style="s2">after they talk through all the things</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:10.199" style="s2">they might be upset about that they find</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.430" end="00:10:12.649" style="s2">out what they&#39;re upset about and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.199" end="00:10:14.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not so another reason to listen</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.649" end="00:10:16.110" style="s2">especially at the stage of problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.519" end="00:10:18.660" style="s2">formulation is to help people decide</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.110" end="00:10:20.250" style="s2">what their problems aren&#39;t well then the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.660" end="00:10:22.079" style="s2">next thing you have to do to listen is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.250" end="00:10:22.829" style="s2">like okay well now we we know what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.079" end="00:10:28.889" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.829" end="00:10:31.470" style="s2">well what would your client view as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.889" end="00:10:34.740" style="s2">potential solution so assuming that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.470" end="00:10:37.110" style="s2">could be made better in some manner what</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.740" end="00:10:39.629" style="s2">would better look like so you need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.110" end="00:10:42.029" style="s2">develop Co develop a philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.629" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">what&#39;s better and so that&#39;s a goal or a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.029" end="00:10:46.050" style="s2">name and it&#39;s almost like a personalized</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:47.309" style="s2">definition of mental health but it might</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.050" end="00:10:50.730" style="s2">be better to think about it as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.309" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">personalized definition of of a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.730" end="00:10:55.740" style="s2">life and so that&#39;s the next thing you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.240" end="00:10:57.149" style="s2">have to listen about and then the last</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.740" end="00:10:59.250" style="s2">thing you have to listen about and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.149" end="00:11:01.429" style="s2">negotiate as well is okay well now we</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.250" end="00:11:03.569" style="s2">know what your problem is and we know</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.429" end="00:11:05.939" style="s2">hypothetically what the destination is</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.569" end="00:11:07.710" style="s2">with regards to solving that problem is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.939" end="00:11:11.340" style="s2">what are the strategies that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.710" end="00:11:13.470" style="s2">necessary to implement in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.340" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">that positive outcome occur and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.470" end="00:11:17.100" style="s2">that&#39;s something that you negotiate by</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:20.250" style="s2">listening every week it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.100" end="00:11:22.650" style="s2">here&#39;s the goal what steps could we take</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.250" end="00:11:25.290" style="s2">that you would implement that would move</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.650" end="00:11:27.330" style="s2">you towards that goal can you take those</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.290" end="00:11:29.130" style="s2">steps in the world will you do that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.330" end="00:11:31.140" style="s2">week and then watch whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.130" end="00:11:33.690" style="s2">do it and come back and report and also</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.140" end="00:11:35.370" style="s2">tell me and yourself whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.690" end="00:11:37.320" style="s2">implementing that actually worked and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.370" end="00:11:39.150" style="s2">then we can come back and we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.320" end="00:11:41.220" style="s2">discussion about whether you did it or</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.150" end="00:11:42.930" style="s2">not and if you didn&#39;t then how we could</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.220" end="00:11:45.180" style="s2">modify that and if you did how we could</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.930" end="00:11:47.280" style="s2">continue and expand it and if you did do</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.180" end="00:11:50.130" style="s2">it whether it worked and if it if it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.280" end="00:11:52.260" style="s2">what unexpected things occurred and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.130" end="00:11:55.170" style="s2">if any implications there are for</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.260" end="00:11:58.260" style="s2">understanding your problem and for your</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.170" end="00:11:58.830" style="s2">goal and so you know you you need it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.260" end="00:12:00.510" style="s2">map</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.830" end="00:12:02.100" style="s2">you have a starting point you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.510" end="00:12:04.500" style="s2">figure out what that is you have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.100" end="00:12:06.270" style="s2">destination point the desired future you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.500" end="00:12:08.400" style="s2">have to figure out what that is you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.270" end="00:12:09.900" style="s2">to implement and design strategies that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.400" end="00:12:11.460" style="s2">will move the person forward and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.900" end="00:12:13.800" style="s2">you have to test all those strategies</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.460" end="00:12:18.570" style="s2">very strategic thinking very practical</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.800" end="00:12:21.810" style="s2">thinking and so that&#39;s that&#39;s an outline</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.570" end="00:12:23.640" style="s2">of how to do effective psychotherapy I</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.810" end="00:12:25.910" style="s2">would say effective careful</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.640" end="00:12:28.410" style="s2">psychotherapy another bit of advice is</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.910" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">people often who are young counsellors</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.410" end="00:12:34.200" style="s2">are afraid and don&#39;t know how they can</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:35.970" style="s2">not take their clients problems home and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.200" end="00:12:38.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a couple of things to say about</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.970" end="00:12:41.820" style="s2">that the first is they&#39;re not your</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.670" end="00:12:44.910" style="s2">problems and it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.820" end="00:12:47.070" style="s2">remember that it&#39;s partly you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.910" end="00:12:48.810" style="s2">to steal your clients problems I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.070" end="00:12:51.330" style="s2">you might think well if I could take my</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.810" end="00:12:52.830" style="s2">clients problems on myself and lift the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.330" end="00:12:55.710" style="s2">burden from them all wouldn&#39;t that be</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.830" end="00:12:57.750" style="s2">better and the answer is well no because</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.710" end="00:13:00.150" style="s2">someone&#39;s problems are not that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.750" end="00:13:02.700" style="s2">distinguishable from their life and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.150" end="00:13:05.610" style="s2">you&#39;re there to do is facilitate their</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.650" end="00:13:13.950" style="s2">in there and steal it like let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.210" end="00:13:15.990" style="s2">give us a spectacular piece of advice</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.950" end="00:13:17.640" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to give advice now in</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.390" end="00:13:25.140" style="s2">way and they go do it and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.220" end="00:13:27.750" style="s2">solved it&#39;s like well the problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.140" end="00:13:30.090" style="s2">disappeared but they didn&#39;t learn how to</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.090" end="00:13:34.170" style="s2">so they&#39;re in worse shape with future</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.710" end="00:13:36.540" style="s2">problems and it&#39;s your victory in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.170" end="00:13:39.030" style="s2">sense instead of theirs and so you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:46.200" style="s2">also frees you up to some degree because</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.580" end="00:13:48.510" style="s2">it also means that you&#39;re not morally</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.510" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">carry them home and the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.310" end="00:13:56.670" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t do your client any</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">good for their problems to sink you you</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:42.200" style="s2">on any more than that so ok</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:53.310" style="s2">procrastination and instant</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.580" end="00:14:56.450" style="s2">gratification rule me nothing seems to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.310" end="00:14:58.580" style="s2">motivate me nothing seems to motivate me</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.450" end="00:15:01.170" style="s2">what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.580" end="00:15:05.880" style="s2">well I&#39;m gonna give you some practical</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.170" end="00:15:08.550" style="s2">advice I would say you need a plan like</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.880" end="00:15:11.010" style="s2">you need a plan and not just a plan you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.550" end="00:15:13.740" style="s2">need a reason to implement the plan you</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.010" end="00:15:15.540" style="s2">need both of those so something</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.740" end="00:15:18.450" style="s2">motivates you you already said instant</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.540" end="00:15:20.130" style="s2">gratification motivates you so you&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.450" end="00:15:23.310" style="s2">things for instant gratification</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.130" end="00:15:24.990" style="s2">now look instant gratification is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.310" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">particular form of reward it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.990" end="00:15:28.890" style="s2">incentive reward and it&#39;s mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:31.530" style="s2">dopaminergic circuitry the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.890" end="00:15:32.910" style="s2">circuitry that mediates reward as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.530" end="00:15:35.059" style="s2">consequence of using drugs like cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.910" end="00:15:38.149" style="s2">or any of the drugs that people abuse</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.059" end="00:15:39.919" style="s2">and so there are certain short-term</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.149" end="00:15:43.129" style="s2">activities that are pleasurable enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.919" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">so they produce an intrinsic they</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.129" end="00:15:46.369" style="s2">intrinsically produce a dopamine kick</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.109" style="s2">and a lot of that&#39;s instantaneous</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.369" end="00:15:48.709" style="s2">gratification like say eating when</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.109" end="00:15:50.629" style="s2">you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.709" end="00:15:52.399" style="s2">at least the taste and flavor of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.629" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">food because there&#39;s also a satiation</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.399" end="00:15:56.119" style="s2">element that comes along with food and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:57.409" style="s2">so there&#39;s those those pleasures that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.119" end="00:16:00.429" style="s2">speak for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.409" end="00:16:03.379" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at the long-run</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.429" end="00:16:07.069" style="s2">things that are rewards that are delayed</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.379" end="00:16:09.379" style="s2">don&#39;t produce as much of a dopamine kick</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.069" end="00:16:10.549" style="s2">so they&#39;re not as immediately gratifying</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.379" end="00:16:12.199" style="s2">and they&#39;re not as gripping in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.549" end="00:16:15.859" style="s2">present and the way that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.199" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">overcome that is to generate a vision of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.859" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">it&#39;s really it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a plan</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:22.969" style="s2">or a strategy it&#39;s a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:24.799" style="s2">vision that that that that justifies</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.969" end="00:16:27.199" style="s2">your life in some way that you deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.799" end="00:16:28.309" style="s2">believe it has to be that and it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.199" end="00:16:30.019" style="s2">be trivial because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.309" end="00:16:32.899" style="s2">procrastination and instant</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.019" end="00:16:35.929" style="s2">gratification are going to rule you so</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.899" end="00:16:37.669" style="s2">we developed this program called the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.929" end="00:16:39.259" style="s2">future authoring program and it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.669" end="00:16:41.659" style="s2">of the self authoring suite and I&#39;ll run</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.259" end="00:16:43.579" style="s2">through it very rapidly because even if</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.659" end="00:16:45.229" style="s2">you don&#39;t use that program although you</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.579" end="00:16:47.359" style="s2">could because that&#39;s what it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.229" end="00:16:49.579" style="s2">for and I think it makes it easier it</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.359" end="00:16:50.809" style="s2">outlines what&#39;s necessary in order to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.579" end="00:16:52.699" style="s2">overcome the problem that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.809" end="00:16:55.339" style="s2">describing so the first question you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.699" end="00:16:57.289" style="s2">might ask yourself is well what would</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.339" end="00:16:58.579" style="s2">you need to gain and you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.289" end="00:16:59.659" style="s2">real dialogue with yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.579" end="00:17:01.899" style="s2">understand this you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.659" end="00:17:04.509" style="s2">yourself warts-and-all your useless</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.899" end="00:17:07.459" style="s2">procrastinating instant gratification</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.509" end="00:17:09.529" style="s2">seeking self and you have to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.459" end="00:17:12.889" style="s2">and say alright you know you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.529" end="00:17:15.350" style="s2">to your inner badly behaved six-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.889" end="00:17:17.149" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay what is it that you would</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.350" end="00:17:20.360" style="s2">have to have in order to commit to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.149" end="00:17:23.329" style="s2">something in the long run what what kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.360" end="00:17:26.509" style="s2">of vision of the future would would</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.329" end="00:17:28.279" style="s2">justify sacrifices for you and you might</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.509" end="00:17:29.929" style="s2">say well you don&#39;t know it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.279" end="00:17:31.909" style="s2">fine that&#39;s why you have to break it</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.929" end="00:17:33.889" style="s2">down so let me ask you some questions so</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.909" end="00:17:35.749" style="s2">you might think well here&#39;s some things</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.889" end="00:17:38.049" style="s2">that people need in their life because</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.749" end="00:17:41.990" style="s2">your life is not going to be solid</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.980" end="00:17:53.480" style="s2">without managing some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.740" end="00:17:56.120" style="s2">most people need an intimate</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.480" end="00:17:57.410" style="s2">relationship a long-term intimate</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.120" end="00:18:02.150" style="s2">relationship because otherwise they get</p>

<p begin="00:20:51.910" end="00:20:56.350" style="s2">it was hard and it was long-term I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.340" end="00:20:58.660" style="s2">it was a long-term plan though I had to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.350" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">make a choice it was either continue the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.660" end="00:21:05.350" style="s2">fun which was fun I really enjoyed it or</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:08.140" style="s2">do this thing that I really believed was</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.140" end="00:21:11.860" style="s2">worthwhile to do the more worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.210" end="00:21:13.770" style="s2">thing which is why I stopped with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.860" end="00:21:15.730" style="s2">instant gratification like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.770" end="00:21:17.830" style="s2">stopping and this is true for most</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.730" end="00:21:19.510" style="s2">people especially young men who tend to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.830" end="00:21:23.170" style="s2">drink a fair bit and carouse around a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.510" end="00:21:25.540" style="s2">lot most young men stopped that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.170" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">thing at least to some degree around 25</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.540" end="00:21:28.060" style="s2">or 26 and the reason they do that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:29.590" style="s2">because they pick up other</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.060" end="00:21:31.780" style="s2">responsibilities they get a real job</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.590" end="00:21:33.220" style="s2">that has some future and they get a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.780" end="00:21:34.840" style="s2">relationship that&#39;s permanent they have</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.220" end="00:21:37.900" style="s2">a family and they decide well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.840" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">more important than the procrastination</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.900" end="00:21:43.420" style="s2">and the instant gratification okay so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.350" end="00:21:44.920" style="s2">make yourself a damn plan make it into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.420" end="00:21:46.390" style="s2">strategy you could use the future</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.920" end="00:21:49.660" style="s2">authoring program if you like I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.390" end="00:21:51.340" style="s2">highly recommend that do it badly you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.660" end="00:21:53.050" style="s2">might be intimidated by it you know I</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.340" end="00:21:54.610" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to plan it&#39;s like yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.050" end="00:21:56.980" style="s2">know you don&#39;t know how to plan make a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.610" end="00:22:00.430" style="s2">bad plan it&#39;s better than the one you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.980" end="00:22:03.430" style="s2">got so so do it badly and then try and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.430" end="00:22:05.950" style="s2">modify it as needs be and see if that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.430" end="00:22:08.110" style="s2">works you need a philosophy Kody that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.950" end="00:22:11.980" style="s2">the thing you know you&#39;re live in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.110" end="00:22:14.560" style="s2">shallow life and so short-term avoidance</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.980" end="00:22:16.029" style="s2">that&#39;s procrastination you&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.560" end="00:22:18.849" style="s2">because you don&#39;t think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.029" end="00:22:20.649" style="s2">enough you don&#39;t think that the negative</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.849" end="00:22:22.029" style="s2">consequences of not doing what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.649" end="00:22:23.529" style="s2">should do are severe enough you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.059" end="00:22:29.710" style="s2">the way is write about just exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.789" end="00:22:31.659" style="s2">kind of hell you&#39;d be likely to descend</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.429" end="00:23:21.309" style="s2">so alright alright what do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.450" end="00:23:23.259" style="s2">feminine hero journey is do you believe</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.309" end="00:23:24.999" style="s2">females have their own archetypal story</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.259" end="00:23:27.489" style="s2">to follow well yes they certainly do I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.999" end="00:23:32.589" style="s2">think the first of all they have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.489" end="00:23:34.690" style="s2">hero story like men do but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.589" end="00:23:36.429" style="s2">think the classic hero&#39;s story if</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.690" end="00:23:39.190" style="s2">imagine it this way the classic hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.429" end="00:23:41.769" style="s2">story is the archetypal male story with</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.190" end="00:23:43.169" style="s2">with the feminine lurking in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.769" end="00:23:46.049" style="s2">background because like men are</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.169" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">adventurous heroes all things considered</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.049" end="00:23:51.299" style="s2">fundamentally but they&#39;re also very</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:53.649" style="s2">maternal like men take care of children</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.299" end="00:23:56.649" style="s2">families for very long periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.649" end="00:23:57.999" style="s2">so as far as if you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.649" end="00:23:59.979" style="s2">from a purely biological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.999" end="00:24:04.589" style="s2">human males are very maternal</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.979" end="00:24:06.669" style="s2">so both males and females have a an</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.589" end="00:24:09.369" style="s2">aspect to them that&#39;s archetype</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.669" end="00:24:11.289" style="s2">masculine and architects eminent and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.369" end="00:24:13.629" style="s2">would say in the typical male the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.289" end="00:24:15.219" style="s2">archetypal a masculine dominates with</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.629" end="00:24:16.779" style="s2">the archetypal effeminate in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.219" end="00:24:19.389" style="s2">background and then the typical female</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.779" end="00:24:21.999" style="s2">it&#39;s the reverse and so although there</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.389" end="00:24:25.349" style="s2">might be some variation in that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.999" end="00:24:27.839" style="s2">you get the relatively rare female who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.839" end="00:24:32.950" style="s2">orientation to the world and you get the</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.990" end="00:25:44.590" style="s2">Newman in particular talked about he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.760" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">a union commentator he wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.590" end="00:25:47.080" style="s2">called origins and history of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:48.520" style="s2">consciousness which I would highly</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.080" end="00:25:50.140" style="s2">recommend that&#39;s on my list of</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.250" end="00:25:55.900" style="s2">brilliant book Newman talked about</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.580" style="s2">something called the crystallization of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.900" end="00:25:59.980" style="s2">the anima from the great mother</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.580" end="00:26:02.290" style="s2">archetype and so you might say that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.980" end="00:26:04.179" style="s2">men who&#39;ve been dominated by women a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.290" end="00:26:07.210" style="s2">young boy who&#39;s been dominated by his</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.179" end="00:26:10.600" style="s2">mother for example or a man for for who</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.210" end="00:26:13.870" style="s2">who for some reason is dominated and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.600" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">intimidated by the idea of the rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.870" end="00:26:18.010" style="s2">feminine and if you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:20.770" style="s2">that idea you could watch a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.010" end="00:26:23.320" style="s2">called crumb you&#39;ll see exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.770" end="00:26:25.030" style="s2">mean by dominated by the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.320" end="00:26:28.270" style="s2">rejecting feminine I&#39;ve never seen a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.030" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">better example of it that that then and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.270" end="00:26:33.580" style="s2">once laid out in that documentary crumb</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:35.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a brilliant documentary so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.580" end="00:26:37.990" style="s2">female is a hostile judge and very</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.620" end="00:26:40.360" style="s2">critical of men the feminine speaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.990" end="00:26:43.110" style="s2">archetype and so the man has to steel</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.360" end="00:26:46.230" style="s2">himself to face that reject</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.110" end="00:26:48.540" style="s2">to develop his character just like Bill</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.230" end="00:26:52.440" style="s2">Murray does in Groundhog Day exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.540" end="00:26:54.299" style="s2">same story and then free the individual</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.440" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">woman with whom he has a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.299" end="00:26:59.970" style="s2">from the archetypal judgmental feminine</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:02.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s like the male version of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.970" end="00:27:04.260" style="s2">Beauty and the Beast and so then and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.760" end="00:27:06.380" style="s2">female version obviously the hero</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.260" end="00:27:09.150" style="s2">archetype is the fact that women do have</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.380" end="00:27:10.890" style="s2">a heroic role to play in the world as</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.150" end="00:27:15.419" style="s2">well because they confront the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.890" end="00:27:18.840" style="s2">just like men do and Garner wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.419" end="00:27:21.270" style="s2">knowledge riches as a consequence but</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.840" end="00:27:23.610" style="s2">the way I look at it is that well for</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.270" end="00:27:25.260" style="s2">females the feminine archetype is at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.610" end="00:27:27.210" style="s2">forefront and the masculine at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.260" end="00:27:31.049" style="s2">background and and it&#39;s reversed for men</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.210" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s how it looks to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.049" end="00:27:36.900" style="s2">so you caught some Twitter flack for</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:38.970" style="s2">your comment on Brett Kavanaugh care to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.900" end="00:27:41.250" style="s2">address your comment and the blowback</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.970" end="00:27:43.530" style="s2">well I addressed the comment because I</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.250" end="00:27:45.419" style="s2">wrote a blog post and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.530" end="00:27:47.010" style="s2">probably the right way not only to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.419" end="00:27:48.510" style="s2">address it but that would have been the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.010" end="00:27:49.940" style="s2">right way to handle it to begin with so</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.510" end="00:27:52.620" style="s2">I&#39;ll address it</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.940" end="00:27:58.950" style="s2">sure I&#39;ll address it and I&#39;ll address</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.620" end="00:28:02.280" style="s2">the blowback as well look just because</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.950" end="00:28:06.179" style="s2">you have an idea doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.280" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">the only idea and just because you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.179" end="00:28:11.400" style="s2">an idea doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:14.250" style="s2">and so like it&#39;s weird for me in some</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.400" end="00:28:17.010" style="s2">sense to engage in public discourse</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.250" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">especially politically because you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.010" end="00:28:21.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in I&#39;ve been a researcher for</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:23.340" style="s2">a very long period of time and so most</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.090" end="00:28:26.520" style="s2">of the people that I&#39;ve talked to about</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.340" end="00:28:29.549" style="s2">serious ideas most of them many of them</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.520" end="00:28:32.130" style="s2">have been researchers graduate students</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.549" end="00:28:34.679" style="s2">for example and when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.130" end="00:28:36.660" style="s2">about a problem whatever it might be if</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.679" end="00:28:39.210" style="s2">your research oriented what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.660" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">kind of what you do if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.210" end="00:28:43.830" style="s2">therapist the way I laid out advice for</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:47.160" style="s2">a young therapist earlier it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.830" end="00:28:50.250" style="s2">well what does everybody think the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.160" end="00:28:51.900" style="s2">problem is and so you assume that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.250" end="00:28:53.460" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s like okay well we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.900" end="00:28:54.900" style="s2">big discussion but what everybody thinks</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.460" end="00:28:56.490" style="s2">the problem is well what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.900" end="00:28:58.410" style="s2">the real problem is</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.490" end="00:29:01.620" style="s2">what&#39;s the real problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.410" end="00:29:03.900" style="s2">Cavanaugh situation well one might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.620" end="00:29:05.550" style="s2">while Cavanaugh was accused of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.900" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">impropriety when he was a high school</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.550" end="00:29:11.040" style="s2">student and because of that he&#39;s not his</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:13.290" style="s2">suitability for the Supreme Court is in</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.040" end="00:29:15.510" style="s2">question maybe that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.290" end="00:29:17.400" style="s2">yeah maybe and maybe that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.510" end="00:29:18.780" style="s2">problem who the hell knows what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.400" end="00:29:22.830" style="s2">problem is so here&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.780" end="00:29:24.300" style="s2">possibilities we haven&#39;t had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.830" end="00:29:27.390" style="s2">reasonable discussion about what</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.300" end="00:29:30.090" style="s2">constitutes an acceptable statute of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.390" end="00:29:33.690" style="s2">limitations with regards to accusations</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.090" end="00:29:36.390" style="s2">of misbehavior between individuals it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.690" end="00:29:38.730" style="s2">like well can you accuse someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.390" end="00:29:41.490" style="s2">reasonably five years later ten years</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.730" end="00:29:44.309" style="s2">later fifteen years later forty years</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.490" end="00:29:45.540" style="s2">later like is there a limit do you is</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.309" end="00:29:48.120" style="s2">there a more do you have a moral</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.540" end="00:29:50.730" style="s2">obligation if you&#39;re going to accuse</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.120" end="00:29:53.820" style="s2">someone or even seek justice to do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.730" end="00:29:57.120" style="s2">within a reasonable period of time who</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.820" end="00:29:59.970" style="s2">don&#39;ts we don&#39;t so that&#39;s a problem um</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.120" end="00:30:01.980" style="s2">what exactly are the rules that govern</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.970" end="00:30:05.040" style="s2">the conduct of men and women when</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.980" end="00:30:07.260" style="s2">they&#39;re young when they&#39;re drinking are</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.040" end="00:30:08.070" style="s2">we gonna have that conversation no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.260" end="00:30:10.140" style="s2">not going to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.070" end="00:30:11.910" style="s2">either because no one wants to think of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.140" end="00:30:13.770" style="s2">that through and they especially don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.910" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">want to think it through with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.770" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">the complicating additional feature of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.820" style="s2">alcohol think about alcohol is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:25.950" style="s2">reason that people drink is so that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.820" end="00:30:27.690" style="s2">can act stupidly and have fun now the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.950" end="00:30:29.100" style="s2">problem with acting stupidly and having</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.690" end="00:30:31.980" style="s2">fun when you&#39;re sober is that it makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.100" end="00:30:34.530" style="s2">you anxious and so you don&#39;t do it but</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.980" end="00:30:37.140" style="s2">alcohol especially for people for whom</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.530" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">alcohol is a good drug ramps up the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.140" end="00:30:42.870" style="s2">excitement of impulsivity and quells the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:44.429" style="s2">anxiety and so people always drink often</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.870" end="00:30:45.780" style="s2">drink because they want to go out and be</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.429" end="00:30:47.280" style="s2">stupid and have fun and look I</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.780" end="00:30:49.530" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s something to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.280" end="00:30:51.090" style="s2">said for stupid fun but it&#39;s but one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.530" end="00:30:52.890" style="s2">the things that also needs to be said</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.090" end="00:30:54.840" style="s2">about it is it&#39;s bloody well dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.890" end="00:30:56.040" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t want to have that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.840" end="00:30:57.990" style="s2">conversation we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.040" end="00:30:59.910" style="s2">conversation on campuses we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.990" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">the rape crisis nobody talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.910" end="00:31:05.460" style="s2">alcohol sexual assault crisis if men and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:07.650" style="s2">women didn&#39;t drink together there&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.460" end="00:31:09.530" style="s2">virtually no sexual assault and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.650" end="00:31:11.740" style="s2">if people didn&#39;t drink at all there</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.530" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">almost no violent crime because alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.740" end="00:31:16.250" style="s2">contributes to violent crime in a manner</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.760" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">that you can hardly imagine but 50% of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.250" end="00:31:19.880" style="s2">people who are murdered are drunk and</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:21.680" style="s2">about 50% of the people who do the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.880" end="00:31:23.450" style="s2">murdering or drunk and that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.680" end="00:31:25.520" style="s2">an underestimate because the stats</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.450" end="00:31:27.860" style="s2">aren&#39;t kept that well and it also the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.520" end="00:31:30.200" style="s2">vent depends on how you define drunk so</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.860" end="00:31:33.530" style="s2">that could also be a problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.200" end="00:31:35.000" style="s2">well the Liberals left types let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.530" end="00:31:36.650" style="s2">them the left-leaning progressive types</p>

<p begin="00:31:49.580" end="00:31:53.480" style="s2">well is this about Kavanagh at all or is</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.950" end="00:31:56.330" style="s2">this about Roe and Wade and about</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.480" end="00:31:58.250" style="s2">abortion well who knows right it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.330" end="00:32:01.310" style="s2">all those things so it&#39;s an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.250" end="00:32:04.160" style="s2">complicated god-awful situation and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.310" end="00:32:05.870" style="s2">Eric Weinstein and Brett Weinstein we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.160" end="00:32:08.470" style="s2">tweeting about this and it was late at</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.870" end="00:32:10.970" style="s2">night and Eric said as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.470" end="00:32:14.390" style="s2">either way this is not gonna end well</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.970" end="00:32:16.130" style="s2">and I thought oh he said is there an</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.390" end="00:32:17.150" style="s2">alternative is there a way out of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.130" end="00:32:19.340" style="s2">and I thought oh that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.150" end="00:32:21.890" style="s2">question what might be a way out of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.340" end="00:32:23.860" style="s2">and I thought well Cavanaugh is in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.890" end="00:32:27.380" style="s2">rough position because he can&#39;t withdraw</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.860" end="00:32:29.720" style="s2">obviously and perhaps shouldn&#39;t without</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.720" end="00:32:34.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get nominated the same thing his</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.460" end="00:32:37.850" style="s2">life is basically over so but on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.280" end="00:32:42.380" style="s2">other hand he&#39;s tangled up in a scandal</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.850" end="00:32:45.110" style="s2">that&#39;s of sufficient murk and mud so</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.380" end="00:32:47.870" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t self-evident that he can</p>

<p begin="00:32:47.870" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">having every single one of his decisions</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:57.620" style="s2">a tremendous amount of social upheaval</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.150" end="00:33:00.140" style="s2">over the next two or three decades and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.620" end="00:33:02.870" style="s2">it isn&#39;t obvious that that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.140" end="00:33:07.040" style="s2">move forward now it might be fine I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.870" end="00:33:09.050" style="s2">there&#39;s been controversy around other</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.040" end="00:33:10.850" style="s2">Supreme Court justice nominations and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.050" end="00:33:13.430" style="s2">that seems to have basically sorted</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.850" end="00:33:14.390" style="s2">itself out and I already said just</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.430" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">because you&#39;re thinking something</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.390" end="00:33:19.520" style="s2">through doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:21.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a simulation so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.520" end="00:33:23.570" style="s2">well if I was in Cavanaugh&#39;s position</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.380" end="00:33:26.930" style="s2">and I felt that my</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.570" end="00:33:29.520" style="s2">candidacy had been compromised</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.930" end="00:33:31.230" style="s2">perhaps through no fault of my own I</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.520" end="00:33:33.930" style="s2">have not saying anything about his</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.230" end="00:33:35.510" style="s2">innocence or guilt but that my candidacy</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.930" end="00:33:38.250" style="s2">had been compromised by this</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.510" end="00:33:41.910" style="s2">interminable and ugly scandal and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.250" end="00:33:44.520" style="s2">meant that my tenure on the Supreme</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.910" end="00:33:47.280" style="s2">Court might be marked by culturally</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.520" end="00:33:49.950" style="s2">divisive controversy in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.280" end="00:33:53.520" style="s2">maybe it would be better for me to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.950" end="00:33:55.590" style="s2">nominated to say look it&#39;s too murky</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.520" end="00:33:57.960" style="s2">it&#39;s too muddy and I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.590" end="00:34:00.120" style="s2">country is best served by my accepting</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.960" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">the nomination then the Conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.120" end="00:34:05.040" style="s2">can nominate another candidate get their</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:07.830" style="s2">person on the Supreme Court so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.040" end="00:34:09.270" style="s2">no necessary loss there and perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.830" end="00:34:11.610" style="s2">could move forward with a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.270" end="00:34:16.860" style="s2">relative minimum of divisiveness now</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.610" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">look in my blog I laid out all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.860" end="00:34:21.870" style="s2">reasons why that isn&#39;t a good idea like</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:23.429" style="s2">here maybe if you just give me five</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.870" end="00:34:26.790" style="s2">seconds I can read some of them because</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.429" end="00:34:29.250" style="s2">I tried to make a steel man case for why</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.790" end="00:34:32.040" style="s2">my idea wasn&#39;t a good one my idea about</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.250" end="00:34:33.870" style="s2">him withdrawing so just give me one</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.040" end="00:34:35.460" style="s2">second and I&#39;ll read all the potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.870" end="00:34:47.070" style="s2">objections just so that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.460" end="00:34:48.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought them through so perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.070" end="00:34:50.340" style="s2">Democrat opposition would mount a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.570" end="00:34:52.500" style="s2">similar campaign against my putative</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.340" end="00:34:54.510" style="s2">successor well that&#39;s certainly possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.500" end="00:34:56.429" style="s2">I said well that would provide virtually</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.510" end="00:34:58.740" style="s2">unassailable evidence for the purely</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.429" end="00:35:01.110" style="s2">manipulative and political motivation of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.740" end="00:35:03.210" style="s2">the accusers forcing them to duplicate</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.110" end="00:35:04.920" style="s2">their strategy a second time that would</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.210" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">help reveal the machination for what</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.920" end="00:35:09.300" style="s2">they were in the manner that would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:11.010" style="s2">virtually and done undeniable perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.300" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">time is of the essence and there&#39;d be no</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.010" end="00:35:14.190" style="s2">way to place another candidate of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">conservative leaning on the bench before</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.190" end="00:35:20.180" style="s2">the November elections as they say</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.180" end="00:35:29.450" style="s2">okay and then other other arguments</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.560" end="00:35:29.450" style="s2">against my position here they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.980" end="00:35:39.350" style="s2">oh yes if Cavanaugh withdrew after being</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.010" end="00:35:41.270" style="s2">nominated here&#39;s what might happen it</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.350" end="00:35:43.820" style="s2">would be read as an admission of guilt</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.270" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">on his part it would embolden those who</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.820" end="00:35:47.390" style="s2">would use reputation destruction as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:49.700" style="s2">political maneuver it would weaken the</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.350" end="00:35:54.920" style="s2">indicate weakness on the part of the</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.920" end="00:35:58.850" style="s2">November elections it would mean that an</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.869" end="00:36:01.460" style="s2">innocent man has been successfully</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.850" end="00:36:03.770" style="s2">pilloried by a mob it would validate the</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.480" end="00:36:56.900" style="s2">was don&#39;t tweet complicated ideas in 140</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.590" end="00:36:59.030" style="s2">characters about contentious issues in</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.540" end="00:37:06.350" style="s2">the consequences of this for me is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.220" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve withdrawn quite a lot over the last</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.350" end="00:37:10.280" style="s2">three weeks from Twitter its Twitter is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:12.200" style="s2">a very dangerous platform and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.280" end="00:37:16.550" style="s2">taking a break from it while I&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.200" end="00:37:18.170" style="s2">its utility and so I because I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.550" end="00:37:19.850" style="s2">my son about this before and other</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.170" end="00:37:23.210" style="s2">members of my family and we had agreed</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.850" end="00:37:25.430" style="s2">that I wasn&#39;t going to post anything on</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.210" end="00:37:27.560" style="s2">Twitter that should be made into a blog</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.430" end="00:37:30.109" style="s2">but the problem with Twitter is that it</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.560" end="00:37:32.750" style="s2">and/or the problem with me who knows</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.109" end="00:37:35.109" style="s2">where the problem is is that Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.750" end="00:37:38.119" style="s2">invites and facilitates impulsive</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.610" end="00:40:12.180" style="s2">all right so the first thing is I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.670" end="00:40:15.180" style="s2">say well take the results as they are to</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.180" end="00:40:17.730" style="s2">some degree now it depends look you got</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.180" end="00:40:19.860" style="s2">to be careful because if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.730" end="00:40:23.250" style="s2">personality test like this and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.860" end="00:40:24.780" style="s2">depressed so you know the future looks</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.250" end="00:40:26.760" style="s2">really bleak to you the present looks</p>

<p begin="00:40:46.620" end="00:40:51.210" style="s2">consequence of that and so they might be</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.360" end="00:40:52.470" style="s2">more negative because of the mindset</p>

<p begin="00:40:59.360" end="00:41:03.300" style="s2">should I take the results as is and live</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.860" end="00:41:06.180" style="s2">trying to cope with them well one thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.300" end="00:41:09.030" style="s2">is you should at least give yourself</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.900" end="00:44:24.170" style="s2">general advice is find an environment</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:54.500" style="s2">a schedule like a Google Calendar to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.770" end="00:44:56.360" style="s2">start working on that because low</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.080" end="00:45:04.940" style="s2">might need to learn to relax a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.090" end="00:45:09.140" style="s2">bit and to make that a priority so and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.940" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re high in openness well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.140" end="00:45:12.440" style="s2">have a quick answer for what you do if</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:15.410" style="s2">you&#39;re high and openness oh I do I guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.440" end="00:45:19.430" style="s2">I do to some degree try to focus it on</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.410" end="00:45:21.110" style="s2">one thing to some degree on one thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.430" end="00:45:23.240" style="s2">and get good at that because when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:45:24.920" end="00:45:27.590" style="s2">become a dilettante so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.630" end="00:45:30.320" style="s2">you have to do if you&#39;re high in</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.590" end="00:45:33.050" style="s2">openness is develop true expertise in at</p>

<p begin="00:45:33.050" end="00:45:36.440" style="s2">somewhat arbitrarily given that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.610" end="00:45:38.660" style="s2">interested in everything commit to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.440" end="00:45:40.850" style="s2">something if you&#39;re low in openness and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.660" end="00:45:42.410" style="s2">a little closed off compared to what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.850" end="00:45:45.650" style="s2">should be a little narrow-minded let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.410" end="00:45:47.600" style="s2">say and conventional maybe you should</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.650" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">read a book a week join a book club</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.600" end="00:45:55.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing to do um that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:58.340" style="s2">that&#39;s a good start join a book club um</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.100" end="00:45:59.960" style="s2">and and and and open yourself up a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.340" end="00:46:02.360" style="s2">little bit go see a movie now and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.960" end="00:46:05.060" style="s2">as well that would also be helpful you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.360" end="00:46:06.290" style="s2">know and and that&#39;ll widen you out a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.060" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s important you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.290" end="00:46:10.310" style="s2">important for your career and all that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:11.870" style="s2">sort of thing you want to you know your</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.310" end="00:46:14.420" style="s2">temperaments puts you in a certain place</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.870" end="00:46:17.150" style="s2">in the distribution and it isn&#39;t so much</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.420" end="00:46:20.090" style="s2">that you want to move the place is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.150" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">you want to move the variability so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.090" end="00:46:24.080" style="s2">you can be what you need to be when the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:25.670" style="s2">situation demands and that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.080" end="00:46:27.740" style="s2">to blow in the wind it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.670" end="00:46:29.690" style="s2">adaptable instead of constrained tightly</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.740" end="00:46:32.090" style="s2">by your biological predisposition and</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.690" end="00:46:34.190" style="s2">you can learn that it&#39;s painstaking it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.090" end="00:46:39.910" style="s2">it requires a lot of effort but you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.190" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">learn it so my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.910" end="00:46:44.859" style="s2">school is now teaching gender as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:47.890" style="s2">social construct for sexist avoids</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.859" end="00:47:01.180" style="s2">naming boys and girls what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.890" end="00:47:04.270" style="s2">leaving is not an option well I guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.180" end="00:47:05.619" style="s2">the first question is I&#39;ll just take you</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.270" end="00:47:07.270" style="s2">at your word that leaving is not an</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.619" end="00:47:14.470" style="s2">option it certainly might not be an</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.270" end="00:47:17.619" style="s2">option um I would say your best bet and</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.470" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">this is a casual piece of advice because</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.619" end="00:47:23.890" style="s2">I don&#39;t know your particular situation</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:26.680" style="s2">is to find out how many parents</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.890" end="00:47:31.329" style="s2">there are around who are also not happy</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.680" end="00:47:36.309" style="s2">about this and then start to strategize</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.329" end="00:47:38.890" style="s2">I mean look to some degree what people</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.309" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">just define as gender is a social</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.890" end="00:47:45.309" style="s2">construct so let&#39;s look at it this way</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:47.920" style="s2">so there are things that make men men</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.309" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">and that make women women that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.920" end="00:47:55.599" style="s2">universal across cultures so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">except for tiny variations external</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.599" end="00:48:02.260" style="s2">genitalia so but then there are things</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:04.329" style="s2">that do vary across culture with regards</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.260" end="00:48:06.520" style="s2">to whether they&#39;re regarded as masculine</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.329" end="00:48:09.160" style="s2">or feminine male or female and those are</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.520" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">more learned so let&#39;s say that external</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.160" end="00:48:14.049" style="s2">genitalia is not a social construct it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:15.369" style="s2">not learned if we can&#39;t agree on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.049" end="00:48:17.740" style="s2">then we&#39;re not going to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.369" end="00:48:19.480" style="s2">a discussion at all so but there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.740" end="00:48:20.980" style="s2">some things about male behavior and some</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.480" end="00:48:23.079" style="s2">things about female behavior that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.980" end="00:48:25.480" style="s2">culture specific and learned and so to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.079" end="00:48:28.390" style="s2">that degree gender is a social construct</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.480" end="00:48:33.099" style="s2">so so you know you have to give the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.390" end="00:48:34.599" style="s2">devil his due but the problem isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.099" end="00:48:36.250" style="s2">teaching that gender is a social</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.599" end="00:48:39.279" style="s2">construct the problem is teaching the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.250" end="00:48:41.500" style="s2">gender is only a social construct and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.279" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">that&#39;s just wrong it&#39;s absolutely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.500" end="00:48:44.440" style="s2">as soon as someone&#39;s doing that then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:47.799" style="s2">know that you&#39;re dealing with an</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.440" end="00:48:49.750" style="s2">ideologue and the research evidence on</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.799" end="00:48:50.710" style="s2">that for example is crystal clear apart</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.750" end="00:48:52.569" style="s2">from the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.710" end="00:48:53.270" style="s2">morphological differences between men</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.569" end="00:48:56.390" style="s2">and women which</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.270" end="00:48:58.760" style="s2">quite obvious you could name a variety</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.390" end="00:49:01.460" style="s2">of the men have wider jaws they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.760" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">larger teeth they can bite harder they</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.460" end="00:49:05.420" style="s2">have thicker skulls as women certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:07.580" style="s2">can attest to from a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.420" end="00:49:09.020" style="s2">perspective they are more powerful in</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.020" end="00:49:15.710" style="s2">harder there they can throw more</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.650" end="00:50:55.910" style="s2">know of psychologically is that men are</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.530" end="00:50:57.530" style="s2">more prone to be interested in things</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.910" end="00:50:59.060" style="s2">and women are more prone to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.530" end="00:51:00.380" style="s2">interested in people and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.060" end="00:51:02.510" style="s2">quite a large difference by</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.380" end="00:51:05.180" style="s2">Psychological standards and there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.510" end="00:51:06.580" style="s2">any evidence that that is socially</p>

<p begin="00:51:06.580" end="00:51:10.270" style="s2">evidence is that as you make societies</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.770" end="00:51:11.980" style="s2">more egalitarian those differences</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.270" end="00:51:14.020" style="s2">actually get bigger rather than smaller</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.980" end="00:51:16.450" style="s2">and even the London Times three weeks</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.560" end="00:51:51.670" style="s2">side problem is is you don&#39;t know what</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.020" end="00:51:58.690" style="s2">mount a campaign you enoyed about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.590" end="00:52:00.850" style="s2">well write down exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.690" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">annoyed about what bothers you about</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.850" end="00:52:06.550" style="s2">this okay what would you like to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:07.840" style="s2">happen because you need to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.550" end="00:52:10.060" style="s2">problem is and you need to know what</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.840" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">this solution is then you have to start</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.060" end="00:52:15.010" style="s2">thinking about strategy and one strategy</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:16.780" style="s2">is you need some allies you need some</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.010" end="00:52:19.360" style="s2">people on your side now if this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.780" end="00:52:21.490" style="s2">bothering you the probability that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.360" end="00:52:23.620" style="s2">bothering most people is very high</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.490" end="00:52:27.390" style="s2">because it&#39;s very rare especially with</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.620" end="00:52:30.070" style="s2">something like this I mean I would say</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.390" end="00:52:32.320" style="s2">and I think the data support this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.070" end="00:52:34.810" style="s2">that the overwhelming majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.320" end="00:52:37.690" style="s2">do not believe that gender is a social</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.810" end="00:52:40.150" style="s2">construct that there are four sexes and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.690" end="00:52:42.550" style="s2">that avoiding naming boys and girls is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.150" end="00:52:45.130" style="s2">good idea so you&#39;ve got unless you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.550" end="00:52:47.950" style="s2">a very progressive place in which case</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.130" end="00:52:50.620" style="s2">mmm that&#39;s its own problem you got to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.950" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">find some people who would be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.620" end="00:52:55.210" style="s2">go to bat with you and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:52:57.070" style="s2">find it&#39;s a political struggle it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.210" end="00:52:59.800" style="s2">bit of a war it&#39;s like okay who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.070" end="00:53:01.660" style="s2">pushing this who&#39;s the ringleaders for</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.800" end="00:53:03.310" style="s2">this you know it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.660" end="00:53:04.420" style="s2">possible that most of the teachers don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.310" end="00:53:07.390" style="s2">want to do this either but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.420" end="00:53:09.730" style="s2">afraid to say anything so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.390" end="00:53:12.280" style="s2">this is probably a two-year campaign and</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.730" end="00:53:13.540" style="s2">you have to decide if this is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.280" end="00:53:14.980" style="s2">that you want to put your time and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.540" end="00:53:17.740" style="s2">effort into and if you do you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.980" end="00:53:20.190" style="s2">conduct it like a like a war you know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.740" end="00:53:22.589" style="s2">without the violence obviously but but</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.190" end="00:53:25.589" style="s2">it&#39;s the right metaphor it&#39;s like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.589" end="00:53:27.390" style="s2">the set of problems who&#39;s causing them</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.589" end="00:53:29.910" style="s2">what do you want to have happen as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.390" end="00:53:31.319" style="s2">constant as an alternative how are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.910" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">gonna tackle this you&#39;re gonna talk to</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.319" end="00:53:35.160" style="s2">your to your local public authorities</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:36.869" style="s2">school authorities you&#39;re gonna talk to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.160" end="00:53:38.670" style="s2">the local politicians you know talk to</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.869" end="00:53:40.440" style="s2">the principal are you gonna face down</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.670" end="00:53:41.910" style="s2">the teachers are you gonna do that with</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.440" end="00:53:44.280" style="s2">more than one of you are you gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.910" end="00:53:46.290" style="s2">your arguments in order you know are and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.280" end="00:53:48.780" style="s2">and then on a more personal front what</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.290" end="00:53:50.790" style="s2">are you going to do with your daughter</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.780" end="00:53:52.380" style="s2">how are you going to educate her let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.790" end="00:53:54.930" style="s2">say you decide not to take this on on</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.380" end="00:53:56.700" style="s2">the political or public front then you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.930" end="00:53:58.410" style="s2">have to have conversation with her and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.700" end="00:54:00.329" style="s2">find out what she thinks you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.410" end="00:54:02.220" style="s2">because she&#39;ll be doubtful and dubious</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.329" end="00:54:04.710" style="s2">about all of this so a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.220" end="00:54:08.099" style="s2">should be asking her questions you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.710" end="00:54:11.880" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s the best I can do with</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.099" end="00:54:15.020" style="s2">that would you consider adding a realist</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.880" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">of recommended movies to your website</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.020" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">yes I&#39;ve thought about that also a</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:24.480" style="s2">recommended list of books for for young</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:27.900" style="s2">people it&#39;s on the hypothetical list of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">things to do but I haven&#39;t done it yet</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.900" end="00:54:34.980" style="s2">so and I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s likely to</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:36.630" style="s2">make it up the priority list for a while</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.980" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">because I&#39;m pretty booked out for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.630" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">next who knows how long a while um can I</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:46.079" style="s2">understand myself or other big five to s</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:47.880" style="s2">be retaken after some time eg one to two</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.079" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">years and be fairly accurate I ask</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.880" end="00:54:52.230" style="s2">because I believe I have changed well</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:54.500" style="s2">you might have changed I mean look first</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.230" end="00:54:57.510" style="s2">of all people do change as they mature</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.500" end="00:54:59.790" style="s2">personality is relatively stable across</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.510" end="00:55:02.520" style="s2">time but relatively stable doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.790" end="00:55:05.190" style="s2">completely stable it means that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.520" end="00:55:07.140" style="s2">if you were extremely extroverted the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.190" end="00:55:09.770" style="s2">probability that in five years you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.140" end="00:55:12.510" style="s2">going to be extremely introverted is</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.770" end="00:55:15.390" style="s2">very low but if you were extremely</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.510" end="00:55:18.230" style="s2">extroverted it&#39;s conceivable that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.390" end="00:55:21.390" style="s2">know in one or two years you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.230" end="00:55:24.109" style="s2">moderately extroverted you can move and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.390" end="00:55:27.390" style="s2">some of that&#39;s some of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.109" end="00:55:29.940" style="s2">situational some of it&#39;s learning some</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.390" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">of it&#39;s maturation so one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.940" end="00:55:33.819" style="s2">reliable findings in the personality</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:37.390" style="s2">literature is that as people get older</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.819" end="00:55:40.329" style="s2">they get more conscientious more</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.390" end="00:55:42.219" style="s2">agreeable and more emotionally stable</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.329" end="00:55:44.650" style="s2">less neurotic and that those three</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.219" end="00:55:47.499" style="s2">traits clump to make a super trait</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.650" end="00:55:49.660" style="s2">called we called it stability so people</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.499" end="00:55:51.699" style="s2">get more stable as they get older you</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.660" end="00:55:53.739" style="s2">know and I&#39;ve seen people learn to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.699" end="00:55:55.660" style="s2">more conscientious that&#39;s for sure that</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.739" end="00:55:58.569" style="s2">happens that happens I think whenever</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.660" end="00:56:00.789" style="s2">you take people who are who are young</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.569" end="00:56:03.579" style="s2">and sort of flighty and put them through</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.789" end="00:56:04.959" style="s2">a rigorous apprenticeship program you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.579" end="00:56:07.390" style="s2">know where they discipline themselves</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.959" end="00:56:10.259" style="s2">and I&#39;ve seen people become certainly</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.390" end="00:56:14.259" style="s2">become less lower in neuroticism and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.259" end="00:56:17.829" style="s2">less agreeable for that matter so so yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.259" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">you can take them sure take it again two</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.829" end="00:56:21.309" style="s2">years later and and and see you know the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:23.559" style="s2">other thing you can do if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.309" end="00:56:25.690" style="s2">curious about your personality is have</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.559" end="00:56:28.690" style="s2">some other people take the personality</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.690" end="00:56:30.069" style="s2">test about you because you know some</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.690" end="00:56:31.930" style="s2">things about your personality and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.069" end="00:56:33.880" style="s2">they&#39;re accurate to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.930" end="00:56:36.729" style="s2">self-report has some degree of accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.880" end="00:56:38.289" style="s2">but then you can get information from</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.729" end="00:56:41.289" style="s2">other people as well and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.289" end="00:56:43.390" style="s2">another way of determining you know of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.289" end="00:56:47.880" style="s2">helping of helping get an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.390" end="00:56:50.829" style="s2">picture of who you are so you can change</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.880" end="00:56:52.989" style="s2">the more dramatic to change the more</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.829" end="00:56:56.289" style="s2">effort is required that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.989" end="00:56:58.690" style="s2">thinking about it so we know for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.289" end="00:57:00.969" style="s2">that you can change IQ with shift and</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.690" end="00:57:02.949" style="s2">socioeconomic status so imagine that you</p>

<p begin="00:57:02.949" end="00:57:07.869" style="s2">and you know you put one twin into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.799" end="00:57:09.969" style="s2">relatively well-off family and one twin</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.869" end="00:57:11.380" style="s2">into a relatively poor family and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.969" end="00:57:13.539" style="s2">assume that being rich has some</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.380" end="00:57:15.910" style="s2">advantages with regards to intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.539" end="00:57:17.859" style="s2">development you need a three standard if</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.910" end="00:57:20.440" style="s2">I remember correctly you need a three</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.859" end="00:57:22.499" style="s2">standard deviation might be four but you</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.440" end="00:57:26.079" style="s2">need a three or four standard deviation</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.499" end="00:57:27.809" style="s2">move upward in socioeconomic status to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.079" end="00:57:31.239" style="s2">produce a one standard deviation</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.809" end="00:57:33.219" style="s2">increase in IQ so you have to move from</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.239" end="00:57:35.859" style="s2">something like the fifth percentile I</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.219" end="00:57:38.049" style="s2">might have the stats a bit wrong because</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.859" end="00:57:40.059" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do this on the fly you</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.049" end="00:57:42.969" style="s2">have to move from the bottom fifth</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.059" end="00:57:46.329" style="s2">percentile to the top fifth percentile</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.969" end="00:57:47.740" style="s2">in wealth to move from average</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.329" end="00:57:50.560" style="s2">intelligence to eighth</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.740" end="00:57:53.080" style="s2">fifth percentile in intelligence so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.560" end="00:57:55.330" style="s2">can change as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.080" end="00:57:57.790" style="s2">situation but the bigger that changed</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.330" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">the more costly and that could be costly</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.790" end="00:58:03.700" style="s2">in terms of resources or effort so</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:06.460" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you like doing a podcast with</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.700" end="00:58:08.920" style="s2">Elon Musk let&#39;s start an initiative for</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.460" end="00:58:10.690" style="s2">this yes I would like to do a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.920" end="00:58:14.080" style="s2">with Elon Musk I know people who know</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.690" end="00:58:16.600" style="s2">him but we&#39;ve never met yes I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.080" end="00:58:18.369" style="s2">that would be ridiculously fun so if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.600" end="00:58:20.230" style="s2">want to start an initiative for that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.369" end="00:58:23.020" style="s2">go right ahead and who knows maybe it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.230" end="00:58:25.840" style="s2">bear fruit um I am going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.020" end="00:58:27.760" style="s2">concentrating more on my podcast in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.840" end="00:58:29.710" style="s2">few months I&#39;m contracting with a</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:32.110" style="s2">professional company to develop it so</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.710" end="00:58:34.150" style="s2">that it well for a variety of reasons so</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.110" end="00:58:37.360" style="s2">that it moves higher up on the priority</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.150" end="00:58:40.450" style="s2">list so I have a better studio so that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.360" end="00:58:42.070" style="s2">have some staff to help me schedule</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.450" end="00:58:43.930" style="s2">interviews there&#39;s lots of people I want</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.070" end="00:58:47.080" style="s2">to talk to authors and scientists and</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.930" end="00:58:49.510" style="s2">politicians and and and so I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.080" end="00:58:52.359" style="s2">excited about that so so and I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.510" end="00:58:54.250" style="s2">love to talk to Elon Musk so I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.359" end="00:58:58.330" style="s2">that would be ridiculously fun I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.250" end="00:59:01.540" style="s2">would love to find out I&#39;d like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.330" end="00:59:03.310" style="s2">him about his thought process and also</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.540" end="00:59:05.530" style="s2">I&#39;m really curious about how in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.310" end="00:59:07.780" style="s2">world he manages to do multiple</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.530" end="00:59:10.330" style="s2">impossible things because doing one</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.780" end="00:59:12.820" style="s2">impossible thing is impossible but doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.330" end="00:59:15.070" style="s2">like five impossible things is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.820" end="00:59:17.470" style="s2">product of five impossibilities and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.070" end="00:59:19.180" style="s2">just seems like hyper impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.470" end="00:59:20.260" style="s2">he&#39;s managed it you know I mean think</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.180" end="00:59:23.380" style="s2">about it think about what he did he</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.260" end="00:59:25.750" style="s2">built an electric car which is like hard</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.380" end="00:59:28.390" style="s2">and then he built a rocket and then he</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.750" end="00:59:32.170" style="s2">blasted the car into space on his rocket</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.390" end="00:59:35.200" style="s2">like that that&#39;s not that&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.170" end="00:59:38.020" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t happen but it did happen</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.200" end="00:59:39.190" style="s2">and he did it and so I would really I</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.020" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">would love to talk to him I think that</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.190" end="00:59:43.840" style="s2">would be extremely extremely interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:49.540" style="s2">how do you fight a monster without</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.840" end="00:59:50.760" style="s2">becoming one yourself you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.540" end="00:59:52.990" style="s2">become a monster</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.760" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">by fighting with a monster but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.990" end="00:59:57.310" style="s2">actually a good thing to become a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="00:59:58.780" style="s2">monster you see the difference is and</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.310" end="01:00:00.990" style="s2">really this is the answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.780" end="01:00:05.620" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.990" end="01:00:07.780" style="s2">you could stay naive and that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.620" end="01:00:10.710" style="s2">because you&#39;re vulnerable and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.780" end="01:00:13.690" style="s2">useful if you&#39;re naive so that&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.710" end="01:00:15.220" style="s2">situation so let&#39;s say well instead of</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.690" end="01:00:17.020" style="s2">being naive you decide you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.220" end="01:00:21.070" style="s2">go confront the monster okay well the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.020" end="01:00:22.960" style="s2">problem with that is that you become the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.070" end="01:00:24.640" style="s2">monster all right so how do you deal</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.960" end="01:00:27.850" style="s2">with that and the answer is to do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.640" end="01:00:30.990" style="s2">voluntarily to do it voluntarily because</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.850" end="01:00:33.910" style="s2">if you develop your monstrousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.990" end="01:00:38.200" style="s2">voluntarily then perhaps you can bring</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.910" end="01:00:42.610" style="s2">it under civilized control right you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.200" end="01:00:45.310" style="s2">integrate those those that capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.610" end="01:00:47.200" style="s2">mayhem and destruction that you develop</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.310" end="01:00:50.260" style="s2">within yourself you can integrate that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.200" end="01:00:54.160" style="s2">within a comprehensive and properly</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.260" end="01:00:56.320" style="s2">directed practical philosophy and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:01:00.400" style="s2">that means that you&#39;re disciplined you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.320" end="01:01:04.300" style="s2">know like a warrior isn&#39;t a monster so</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.400" end="01:01:06.940" style="s2">you have to you have to align you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.300" end="01:01:09.550" style="s2">to discipline your monstrosity and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.940" end="01:01:10.960" style="s2">do that by developing it voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.550" end="01:01:12.910" style="s2">look you see this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.960" end="01:01:14.740" style="s2">happening all the time in classic hero</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.910" end="01:01:19.180" style="s2">stories like if you look at the story of</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.740" end="01:01:22.030" style="s2">the hobbit for example like Bilbo</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.180" end="01:01:24.100" style="s2">I think Bilbo is the Hobbit right</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.030" end="01:01:32.950" style="s2">Frodo&#39;s the next one let me just look</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.100" end="01:01:36.810" style="s2">that up yeah okay it&#39;s Bilbo good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.950" end="01:01:40.140" style="s2">what I thought now Bilbo when he starts</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.810" end="01:01:42.430" style="s2">when this Hobbit starts the book</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.140" end="01:01:44.500" style="s2">Bilbo lives in this little protected</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.430" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">area so it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the castle</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.500" end="01:01:49.690" style="s2">that the Buddha grows up in all the bad</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.440" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">things are outside of it and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.690" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">for that actually is because the kingdom</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:56.350" style="s2">is guarded by these descendants of great</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">kings the Striders who they&#39;re hobbits</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.350" end="01:02:00.070" style="s2">have some contempt for cuz they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.000" end="01:02:02.740" style="s2">look like tramps Aragorn is one of them</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.070" end="01:02:04.960" style="s2">so the descendants of great kings patrol</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.740" end="01:02:07.090" style="s2">the borders and keep the naive</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.960" end="01:02:08.770" style="s2">inhabitants of the Shire safe and</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.090" end="01:02:09.940" style="s2">they&#39;re naive and they go about their</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.770" end="01:02:11.080" style="s2">day to day work and nothing really</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.940" end="01:02:12.940" style="s2">threatens them and there&#39;s no monsters</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.080" end="01:02:14.200" style="s2">around and because they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.940" end="01:02:16.390" style="s2">real challenges and</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.200" end="01:02:18.790" style="s2">they&#39;re peaceful in their wealth and</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.390" end="01:02:20.590" style="s2">security they think they&#39;re good but</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.790" end="01:02:23.590" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re just naive and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.590" end="01:02:26.260" style="s2">undisciplined and relatively weak and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.590" end="01:02:27.940" style="s2">they&#39;re not prepared for anything when</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.260" end="01:02:29.830" style="s2">all hell breaks loose they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.940" end="01:02:32.470" style="s2">they&#39;re like they&#39;re like they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.830" end="01:02:36.180" style="s2">bait they&#39;re like prey you know so and</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.470" end="01:02:39.250" style="s2">of course the wizard Gandalf knows this</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.180" end="01:02:41.890" style="s2">now despite the fact that the shire-folk</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.250" end="01:02:44.560" style="s2">are rather small and a bit comical and</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.890" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">tremendously naive they do have a latent</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.560" end="01:02:49.690" style="s2">ability for courage and and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:51.940" style="s2">forthrightness and Gandalf can really</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.690" end="01:02:55.360" style="s2">see this in the one Hobbit Bilbo and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.940" end="01:02:59.350" style="s2">he tells Bilbo that darkness is brewing</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.360" end="01:03:01.450" style="s2">on the outs in the Outlands outside of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.350" end="01:03:03.640" style="s2">protected territory absolutely classic</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.450" end="01:03:06.970" style="s2">mythological representation it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.640" end="01:03:08.860" style="s2">same in the Lion King where Mustafa</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.970" end="01:03:10.540" style="s2">tells Simba that his kingdom is</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.860" end="01:03:12.250" style="s2">everything that the light falls on and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.540" end="01:03:14.140" style="s2">that he&#39;s not to journey outside of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.250" end="01:03:15.700" style="s2">domain right that&#39;s the elephant</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.140" end="01:03:17.950" style="s2">graveyard and death and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.700" end="01:03:19.660" style="s2">that&#39;s outside of the shire let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.950" end="01:03:21.880" style="s2">it&#39;s outside of paradise it&#39;s outside of</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.660" end="01:03:24.810" style="s2">the walled city it&#39;s outside of your</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.880" end="01:03:29.350" style="s2">domain of knowledge well that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.810" end="01:03:31.540" style="s2">that&#39;s where that&#39;s where malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.350" end="01:03:32.980" style="s2">and chaos Bruce now you see that again</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.540" end="01:03:35.470" style="s2">and in the Lion King because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.980" end="01:03:38.080" style="s2">where scar and the hyenas go off to to</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.470" end="01:03:40.480" style="s2">conspire and turn into what are</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.080" end="01:03:44.590" style="s2">essentially jackbooted Nazis before they</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.480" end="01:03:47.110" style="s2">take over the pride land same idea okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.590" end="01:03:51.580" style="s2">well so what happens to Bilbo when he</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.110" end="01:03:53.980" style="s2">goes off to confront the dragon um he</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.580" end="01:03:57.550" style="s2">has to become a thief right which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.980" end="01:03:59.620" style="s2">very picky it&#39;s very it&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.550" end="01:04:01.090" style="s2">ethically because while Bilbo wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.620" end="01:04:03.870" style="s2">thief and you think what&#39;s better to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.090" end="01:04:06.940" style="s2">to not be a thief than to be a thief and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.870" end="01:04:09.250" style="s2">the answer to that it&#39;s very hard answer</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.940" end="01:04:17.890" style="s2">very complicated answer and it&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.250" end="01:04:20.260" style="s2">to be dealt with lightly it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.890" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">not good to be moral if the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.260" end="01:04:25.120" style="s2">your moral is because you cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:28.140" style="s2">otherwise that&#39;s the naivety issue right</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.120" end="01:04:30.360" style="s2">so naivety is not morality</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.140" end="01:04:33.180" style="s2">and if you&#39;re terrified to be a thief</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.360" end="01:04:33.930" style="s2">and you have no skill at it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.180" end="01:04:36.060" style="s2">not a thief</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.930" end="01:04:37.800" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re good now if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.060" end="01:04:40.110" style="s2">could be the best thief in the world man</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.800" end="01:04:42.240" style="s2">you were one sneaky character and and</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.110" end="01:04:43.890" style="s2">and fast on your feet and a real</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.240" end="01:04:45.720" style="s2">strategic thinker and capable of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.890" end="01:04:47.970" style="s2">breaking rules when necessary and</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.720" end="01:04:50.400" style="s2">scaling walls and climbing houses and</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.970" end="01:04:52.800" style="s2">infiltrating parties and plotting for</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.400" end="01:04:54.780" style="s2">the long run and then you decided not to</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.800" end="01:04:56.700" style="s2">do it well then then that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.780" end="01:04:58.890" style="s2">different story then you&#39;re a moral</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.700" end="01:05:02.190" style="s2">animal right so you need that capacity</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.890" end="01:05:03.750" style="s2">for criminality you need the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.190" end="01:05:05.370" style="s2">for criminality you need the capacity of</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.750" end="01:05:08.430" style="s2">evil and you need to have mastered that</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.370" end="01:05:09.870" style="s2">and that&#39;s what makes you good and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.430" end="01:05:12.150" style="s2">well that&#39;s what happens in the Hobbit</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.870" end="01:05:15.000" style="s2">is that Bilbo has to develop his dark</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.150" end="01:05:18.030" style="s2">side his shadow and he does that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.000" end="01:05:19.620" style="s2">know and and well he&#39;s a thief in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.030" end="01:05:21.930" style="s2">variety of ways he ends up stealing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.620" end="01:05:24.150" style="s2">ring which is really interesting and of</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.930" end="01:05:27.360" style="s2">course that leads into the Lord of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.150" end="01:05:30.180" style="s2">Rings so and and and but you know the</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.360" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">look he doesn&#39;t get away scot-free from</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.180" end="01:05:33.660" style="s2">developing his dark side like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:35.430" style="s2">touched by evil from then on in he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.660" end="01:05:37.020" style="s2">the ring problem and that&#39;s a big one</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.430" end="01:05:38.550" style="s2">that thing that might possess him</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.020" end="01:05:40.470" style="s2">because he&#39;s got too close to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.550" end="01:05:41.700" style="s2">like Harry Potter Potter and his scar</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.470" end="01:05:43.530" style="s2">and the fact that he has a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.700" end="01:05:45.960" style="s2">Voldemort in him it&#39;s exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.530" end="01:05:49.370" style="s2">idea or the strange affinity that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.960" end="01:05:53.100" style="s2">Joker insists upon and Joker in Batman</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.370" end="01:05:55.380" style="s2">um when when Bilbo comes back to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.100" end="01:05:57.660" style="s2">shire like he&#39;s never one of the hobbits</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.380" end="01:06:00.060" style="s2">again he&#39;s always an outsider he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.660" end="01:06:01.860" style="s2">glimmer of magic and danger about him</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.060" end="01:06:04.370" style="s2">and that makes people respect him but</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.860" end="01:06:06.630" style="s2">they also they also think that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.370" end="01:06:09.210" style="s2">unconventional in an unacceptable way</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.630" end="01:06:11.430" style="s2">and you know kind of make a wide berth</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.210" end="01:06:13.950" style="s2">around him because now he&#39;s contaminated</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.430" end="01:06:15.090" style="s2">with with evil and the unknown even</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.950" end="01:06:17.100" style="s2">though that makes him a much better</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.090" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">character all things considered and a</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.100" end="01:06:20.820" style="s2">real fighter in the battle between good</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:22.680" style="s2">and evil and the person who&#39;s gone out</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.820" end="01:06:26.460" style="s2">and confronted the dragon and got the</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.680" end="01:06:28.440" style="s2">treasure all of that so well the pathway</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.460" end="01:06:30.960" style="s2">- from naivety to the full development</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.440" end="01:06:33.150" style="s2">of character is associated with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.960" end="01:06:34.800" style="s2">development in the Union sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.150" end="01:06:36.510" style="s2">shadow and that&#39;s that capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.800" end="01:06:40.800" style="s2">mayhem and malevolence that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.510" end="01:06:42.070" style="s2">brought under control so yes it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.800" end="01:06:46.660" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.070" end="01:06:48.100" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated and and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.660" end="01:06:49.480" style="s2">mean that you&#39;re justified in going out</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.100" end="01:06:51.100" style="s2">and breaking rules because you think</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.480" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">that you&#39;re building your character you</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.100" end="01:06:58.930" style="s2">know it&#39;s not that simple if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:07:00.910" style="s2">if you look at stories like Harry Potter</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.930" end="01:07:05.080" style="s2">you know all of Harry&#39;s crew breaks</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.910" end="01:07:06.460" style="s2">rules but they only break a rule when</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.080" end="01:07:09.040" style="s2">not breaking it would break a</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.460" end="01:07:10.660" style="s2">higher-order rule and that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.040" end="01:07:15.130" style="s2">morally ambivalent right because the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.660" end="01:07:17.050" style="s2">best pathway forward is to violate no</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.130" end="01:07:18.940" style="s2">conventions to do the right thing and</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.050" end="01:07:20.800" style="s2">violate new conventions nope no</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.940" end="01:07:24.550" style="s2">conventions but now and then you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.800" end="01:07:26.710" style="s2">terrible situation where you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.550" end="01:07:29.800" style="s2">do a small bad thing or a large bad</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.710" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2">thing or you can allow a large bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.800" end="01:07:37.630" style="s2">to happen by by by not by by failing to</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:40.240" style="s2">break a rule that often happens in Harry</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.630" end="01:07:42.670" style="s2">Potter so then you&#39;re in in trouble and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.240" end="01:07:44.830" style="s2">part of being wise and oriented towards</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.670" end="01:07:46.900" style="s2">the good is to know when breaking a rule</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.830" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">is the right thing to do even though you</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.900" end="01:07:55.180" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t break rules so Canada has</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:08:01.270" style="s2">legalized marijuana what are your</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.180" end="01:08:03.370" style="s2">thoughts it&#39;s about time that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.270" end="01:08:08.680" style="s2">thoughts I think that once a certain</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.370" end="01:08:11.140" style="s2">number of people break a law then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.680" end="01:08:16.140" style="s2">not reasonable to have the law that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.140" end="01:08:16.140" style="s2">part of it it isn&#39;t obvious to me that</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.190" end="01:08:24.339" style="s2">it was irrational in some sense to have</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.750" end="01:08:26.140" style="s2">for marijuana to be illegal especially</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.339" end="01:08:27.490" style="s2">given that alcohol is legal because they</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.140" end="01:08:30.279" style="s2">all calls way more dangerous than</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.490" end="01:08:33.910" style="s2">marijuana I&#39;m more or less libertarian</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.279" end="01:08:35.710" style="s2">on this front it&#39;s like smoke your damn</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.910" end="01:08:37.660" style="s2">pot and try not to act like too much of</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.710" end="01:08:40.660" style="s2">a [ __ ] when you&#39;re stoned that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.660" end="01:08:41.259" style="s2">it looks like to me so and I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.660" end="01:08:43.200" style="s2">feel that way</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.259" end="01:08:47.700" style="s2">across the spectrum of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.200" end="01:08:51.040" style="s2">altering substances it&#39;s like you you I</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.700" end="01:08:54.370" style="s2">think that the danger of restricting</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.040" end="01:08:55.409" style="s2">people&#39;s freedoms unnecessarily is more</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.370" end="01:08:57.449" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.409" end="01:09:00.179" style="s2">than the danger of not restricting them</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.449" end="01:09:03.080" style="s2">and so you&#39;re entitled to go to hell in</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.179" end="01:09:05.880" style="s2">a handbasket in your own manner and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.080" end="01:09:09.270" style="s2">hopefully but I do think that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.880" end="01:09:11.069" style="s2">going to engage or indulge in your</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.270" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">favorite drug of abuse that you should</p>

<p begin="01:09:16.799" end="01:09:23.699" style="s2">be then I would also say with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.199" end="01:09:26.370" style="s2">drug trade in general is that here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.699" end="01:09:28.500" style="s2">bunch of consequences of the war on</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.370" end="01:09:30.150" style="s2">drugs lot of them unexpected first of</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.500" end="01:09:32.310" style="s2">all terrible incarceration rate</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.150" end="01:09:34.799" style="s2">especially in the United States that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.310" end="01:09:36.690" style="s2">not so good second is the dumping of</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.799" end="01:09:38.520" style="s2">hundreds of millions or billions of</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.690" end="01:09:40.620" style="s2">dollars into the hands of like serious</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.520" end="01:09:42.480" style="s2">criminals and the destabilization of</p>

<p begin="01:09:44.670" end="01:09:50.310" style="s2">then the enriching of people who are</p>

<p begin="01:09:50.310" end="01:09:53.489" style="s2">criminals and to give them that much</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.049" end="01:09:56.070" style="s2">power is a bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.489" end="01:09:58.110" style="s2">so maybe the government has to tax and</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.070" end="01:09:59.699" style="s2">regulate like it does with cigarettes</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.110" end="01:10:03.270" style="s2">and it does with alcohol and to some</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.699" end="01:10:07.050" style="s2">degree it does with gambling then the</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.270" end="01:10:12.929" style="s2">next issue is one of the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.050" end="01:10:16.290" style="s2">now of the the the classification of</p>

<p begin="01:10:18.750" end="01:10:22.889" style="s2">and so what they do is they keep making</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.670" end="01:10:25.110" style="s2">variants of addictive drugs and now</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.889" end="01:10:27.300" style="s2">instead of a dozen drugs of abuse which</p>

<p begin="01:10:30.179" end="01:10:37.290" style="s2">more addictive than the original drugs</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.699" end="01:10:39.780" style="s2">and so it isn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.290" end="01:10:41.280" style="s2">good policy to me and I know that places</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.780" end="01:10:44.670" style="s2">like Portugal for example have</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.280" end="01:10:47.219" style="s2">decriminalized every drug of abuse and</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.670" end="01:10:51.420" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.219" end="01:10:53.420" style="s2">catastrophe so well we&#39;ll see right we</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.420" end="01:10:56.159" style="s2">legalize marijuana yesterday there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.420" end="01:10:59.159" style="s2">the streets aren&#39;t full of stoned people</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.159" end="01:11:02.130" style="s2">bumping into walls nothing&#39;s changed I</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.159" end="01:11:04.650" style="s2">hope it works I hope that the government</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.130" end="01:11:08.010" style="s2">regulates it properly that they derive</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.650" end="01:11:09.300" style="s2">tax revenue from it and that people use</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.010" end="01:11:12.030" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.300" end="01:11:14.790" style="s2">and that people use alcohol a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.030" end="01:11:18.930" style="s2">less that would be good because alcohol</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.790" end="01:11:20.880" style="s2">is a very dangerous drug so okay so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.930" end="01:11:23.550" style="s2">going to go for eight more minutes I</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.880" end="01:11:25.710" style="s2">have to stop comparatively early today</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.550" end="01:11:28.680" style="s2">because I have to pack and then I have</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.710" end="01:11:31.940" style="s2">to go to Dublin and so just to warn you</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.680" end="01:11:31.940" style="s2">all so</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.460" end="01:12:09.989" style="s2">do you have any advice on how to vet a</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.860" end="01:12:15.600" style="s2">potential marriage partner during the</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.989" end="01:12:19.409" style="s2">dating relationship phase god that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.600" end="01:12:21.719" style="s2">hard question okay so while I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.409" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">you what I&#39;ve observed as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.719" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">of watching you know all the married</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">people successful and unsuccessful who I</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:33.350" style="s2">know but also watching all my clients</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:33.350" style="s2">and giving this a fair bit of thought</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.420" end="01:12:47.820" style="s2">here here&#39;s some of what&#39;s necessary for</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.739" end="01:12:51.090" style="s2">a successful marriage you have to trust</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.820" end="01:12:53.010" style="s2">the person that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.090" end="01:12:54.030" style="s2">make mistakes because you&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.010" end="01:12:56.820" style="s2">mistakes and so are they but</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.030" end="01:12:59.429" style="s2">fundamentally you have to trust them and</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.820" end="01:13:02.790" style="s2">what that means is that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.429" end="01:13:04.320" style="s2">trust that if things go wrong if they</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.790" end="01:13:07.949" style="s2">make a mistake they&#39;ll do what was</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.320" end="01:13:10.290" style="s2">necessary in conjunction with you to set</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.949" end="01:13:12.179" style="s2">it right you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.290" end="01:13:13.650" style="s2">negotiate with the person and those two</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.179" end="01:13:16.949" style="s2">things are tied very very close together</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.650" end="01:13:20.040" style="s2">so if you you guys have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.949" end="01:13:24.350" style="s2">have a conversation about what it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.040" end="01:13:24.350" style="s2">that you want to do come to a conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.400" end="01:13:30.330" style="s2">moderate your differences move forward</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.380" end="01:13:33.120" style="s2">and have that work you have to be able</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.330" end="01:13:36.390" style="s2">to fight and make up both of those if</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.120" end="01:13:39.929" style="s2">you can&#39;t fight with your potential</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.390" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">marriage partner then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.929" end="01:13:44.210" style="s2">communicating because there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:46.170" style="s2">bloody way that you&#39;re gonna get along</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.210" end="01:13:47.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no way you&#39;re gonna agree on</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.170" end="01:13:51.960" style="s2">everything that&#39;s just not going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.400" end="01:13:53.969" style="s2">happen so you you have to be honest with</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.960" end="01:13:55.620" style="s2">one another enough to have some conflict</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.969" end="01:13:58.890" style="s2">but then you have to be able to make up</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.620" end="01:14:00.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge deal man because well then</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.890" end="01:14:01.170" style="s2">you get to have conflict and solve</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.120" end="01:14:06.840" style="s2">problems and make up</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.170" end="01:14:09.810" style="s2">so trust negotiation conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.840" end="01:14:11.580" style="s2">the next thing I would say is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.810" end="01:14:13.170" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of nice if you&#39;re attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.580" end="01:14:16.110" style="s2">each other you know if there&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.170" end="01:14:17.639" style="s2">sexual attraction there it isn&#39;t obvious</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.110" end="01:14:18.790" style="s2">to me that that&#39;s something that can be</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.639" end="01:14:21.250" style="s2">conjured up it</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.790" end="01:14:24.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist I haven&#39;t seen that happen</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.250" end="01:14:27.670" style="s2">successfully it&#39;s that seems to depend</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.100" end="01:14:29.860" style="s2">on factors that aren&#39;t really under</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.670" end="01:14:31.900" style="s2">voluntary control you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.860" end="01:14:33.070" style="s2">obviously people can modify themselves</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.900" end="01:14:35.830" style="s2">to some degree to be more or less</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.070" end="01:14:37.960" style="s2">attractive staying in physical shape and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.830" end="01:14:40.270" style="s2">and and that sort of thing dressing</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.960" end="01:14:43.230" style="s2">nicely and and and having a certain</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.270" end="01:14:45.430" style="s2">amount of sex appeal and charisma and</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.230" end="01:14:47.440" style="s2">provocative nough stats all there but</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.430" end="01:14:49.690" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s all well and good and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.440" end="01:14:52.120" style="s2">important but I do believe that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.690" end="01:14:54.100" style="s2">spark that&#39;s outside of voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.120" end="01:14:56.770" style="s2">control is a necessary precondition for</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.100" end="01:14:59.470" style="s2">a long-lasting relationship I do believe</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.770" end="01:15:02.230" style="s2">though that if it&#39;s there you still have</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.470" end="01:15:03.580" style="s2">to work very hard to maintain it as hard</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.230" end="01:15:06.810" style="s2">in your marriage as you would when</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.580" end="01:15:09.610" style="s2">you&#39;re dating and you need to know that</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.810" end="01:15:11.320" style="s2">then I it&#39;s also helpful if you actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.610" end="01:15:13.300" style="s2">like the person you know if they&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.320" end="01:15:15.460" style="s2">friend that you actually like to go do</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.300" end="01:15:17.230" style="s2">things with them sort of independent of</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.460" end="01:15:20.080" style="s2">the romantic element you know if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.230" end="01:15:22.330" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to want to do everything</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.080" end="01:15:25.210" style="s2">together but you should have some things</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.330" end="01:15:28.030" style="s2">that you like to do in common so some</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.210" end="01:15:30.220" style="s2">similarity and personality is useful the</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.030" end="01:15:32.560" style="s2">personality scale is useful for that</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.220" end="01:15:34.840" style="s2">like look here here it&#39;s really hard for</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.560" end="01:15:37.210" style="s2">an extreme extrovert and an extreme</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.840" end="01:15:38.860" style="s2">introvert to live together because the</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.210" end="01:15:40.240" style="s2">extreme extrovert wants to be with</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.860" end="01:15:43.240" style="s2">people all the time and the extreme</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.240" end="01:15:46.510" style="s2">introvert is immediately exhausted by</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.240" end="01:15:49.000" style="s2">that and it&#39;s neither of those things</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.510" end="01:15:52.390" style="s2">are precisely under voluntary control</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.000" end="01:15:54.700" style="s2">um it&#39;s really hard for someone super</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.390" end="01:15:57.370" style="s2">agreeable and super disagreeable to get</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.700" end="01:15:59.470" style="s2">along together because the agreeable</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.370" end="01:16:01.540" style="s2">person isn&#39;t going to be able to stand</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.470" end="01:16:03.040" style="s2">up very well to the disagreeable person</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.540" end="01:16:04.960" style="s2">and the disagreeable person is going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.040" end="01:16:09.130" style="s2">think that the agreeable person is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.960" end="01:16:10.990" style="s2">pushover that&#39;s rough it&#39;s very hard for</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.130" end="01:16:12.550" style="s2">someone hi and openness and someone very</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.990" end="01:16:14.440" style="s2">low and openness to be together because</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.550" end="01:16:15.820" style="s2">the open person is like fascinated by</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.440" end="01:16:17.350" style="s2">ideas and really interested in</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.820" end="01:16:19.210" style="s2">aesthetics and art and philosophy and</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.350" end="01:16:21.220" style="s2">poetry and all of that and the person</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.210" end="01:16:23.500" style="s2">who&#39;s low and openness it&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.220" end="01:16:28.830" style="s2">color blind to that it&#39;s not in their</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.500" end="01:16:31.180" style="s2">realm of involuntary interest</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.830" end="01:16:32.620" style="s2">conscientiousness the same thing if if</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.180" end="01:16:34.600" style="s2">you if you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.620" end="01:16:37.480" style="s2">conscientious person very diligent nose</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.600" end="01:16:40.690" style="s2">to the grindstone industrious and</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.480" end="01:16:42.840" style="s2">orderly and your partner can wile away</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.690" end="01:16:46.240" style="s2">the time with no problem whatsoever and</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.840" end="01:16:49.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mind a mess and disorder then</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.240" end="01:16:51.700" style="s2">that&#39;s the the conscientious person is</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.810" end="01:16:53.800" style="s2">going to think that the unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.700" end="01:16:56.260" style="s2">person is useless and the unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.800" end="01:16:58.090" style="s2">person is going to think that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.260" end="01:17:01.120" style="s2">conscientious person is an uptight</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.090" end="01:17:03.880" style="s2">tyrant and that&#39;s very very hard to</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:06.490" style="s2">overcome it&#39;sit&#39;s like a fatal flaw</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.880" end="01:17:08.320" style="s2">so those extreme personality differences</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.490" end="01:17:09.700" style="s2">across more than one or two traits is</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.320" end="01:17:12.940" style="s2">gonna make your relationship</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.700" end="01:17:15.130" style="s2">extraordinarily difficult so the only</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.940" end="01:17:18.310" style="s2">place where that might be different is</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.130" end="01:17:22.030" style="s2">that you know you probably don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.310" end="01:17:23.440" style="s2">both be high in neuroticism so like if</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.030" end="01:17:25.180" style="s2">one of you is high in neuroticism and</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.440" end="01:17:28.810" style="s2">the other isn&#39;t that&#39;s kind of a nice</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.180" end="01:17:30.340" style="s2">balance because one of you will be a</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.810" end="01:17:32.620" style="s2">little alert to threat and the other one</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.340" end="01:17:34.480" style="s2">will calm the one who&#39;s alert to threat</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.620" end="01:17:36.130" style="s2">down if you&#39;re both low in neuroticism</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.480" end="01:17:37.750" style="s2">well then that&#39;s not gonna be too much</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.130" end="01:17:40.150" style="s2">of a problem although you might be a</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.750" end="01:17:42.490" style="s2">little bit less risk-averse than you</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.150" end="01:17:44.230" style="s2">should be but mostly you want a fair bit</p>

<p begin="01:17:44.230" end="01:17:49.030" style="s2">then I guess the other thing is is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.320" end="01:17:52.210" style="s2">well do you have something like a shared</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.030" end="01:17:57.220" style="s2">vision of the future you know like how</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.210" end="01:17:59.380" style="s2">are you going to mediate the inevitable</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.220" end="01:18:02.650" style="s2">conflict between whose career takes</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.380" end="01:18:04.390" style="s2">priority and and what about kids do you</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.650" end="01:18:06.010" style="s2">both want kids and if you do want kids</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.390" end="01:18:06.610" style="s2">when do you want them and how many do</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.010" end="01:18:08.830" style="s2">you want</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.610" end="01:18:11.410" style="s2">and what&#39;s your sense about who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.830" end="01:18:12.520" style="s2">responsible for what win with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.410" end="01:18:14.140" style="s2">the kids and the same when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.520" end="01:18:16.630" style="s2">running a household it&#39;s like do you</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.140" end="01:18:18.370" style="s2">have some sense of do you have enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.630" end="01:18:20.980" style="s2">shared belief so that running a</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.370" end="01:18:22.840" style="s2">household together is something that is</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.980" end="01:18:24.730" style="s2">with a peaceful household and a</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.840" end="01:18:29.170" style="s2">productive household is within the realm</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.730" end="01:18:32.910" style="s2">of possibility so there that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.170" end="01:18:34.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like to me so</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.910" end="01:18:40.150" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.780" end="01:18:42.580" style="s2">so you said you act as if God exists do</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.150" end="01:18:44.680" style="s2">you also act as if the devil exists man</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.580" end="01:18:46.389" style="s2">I think I probably act even more as if</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.680" end="01:18:48.850" style="s2">the devil exists because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.389" end="01:18:51.280" style="s2">in some sense it&#39;s a lot more easy for</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.850" end="01:18:53.800" style="s2">me and I think it is for most people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.280" end="01:18:56.619" style="s2">it&#39;s easy it&#39;s easier for me to believe</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.800" end="01:18:58.869" style="s2">in the reality of malevolence and evil</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.619" end="01:19:02.500" style="s2">and to be terrified about that getting a</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.869" end="01:19:04.869" style="s2">grip on me than it is to be optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.500" end="01:19:08.050" style="s2">and naive about the possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.869" end="01:19:11.199" style="s2">transcendent good like it it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.050" end="01:19:12.940" style="s2">it it&#39;s not that I am skeptical about</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.199" end="01:19:16.239" style="s2">the reality of transcendent good I mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.940" end="01:19:17.949" style="s2">fundamentally I believe that good is</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.239" end="01:19:20.320" style="s2">more powerful than evil I do believe</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.949" end="01:19:22.480" style="s2">that but there&#39;s something palpable</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.320" end="01:19:23.590" style="s2">about evil that is and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.480" end="01:19:25.270" style="s2">undeniable</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.590" end="01:19:27.550" style="s2">it&#39;s like well you can debate about</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.270" end="01:19:29.380" style="s2">whether or not heaven exists you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.550" end="01:19:30.909" style="s2">and you could even be skeptical but you</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.380" end="01:19:32.770" style="s2">can&#39;t debate about whether the Gulag</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.909" end="01:19:34.750" style="s2">Archipelago exists and you can&#39;t debate</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.770" end="01:19:37.960" style="s2">about arsh wits and you can&#39;t debate</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.750" end="01:19:39.639" style="s2">about the fact that people&#39;s proclivity</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.960" end="01:19:42.100" style="s2">towards blindness and malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.639" end="01:19:43.810" style="s2">produced those horrors and the horrors</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.100" end="01:19:45.369" style="s2">that people often encounter in their day</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.810" end="01:19:49.060" style="s2">to day world and in the relationship so</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.369" end="01:19:52.360" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy for someone like me to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.060" end="01:19:55.480" style="s2">a believer in evil and to try to turn</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.360" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">away from that and so and but but</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.480" end="01:20:01.540" style="s2">through deep contemplation you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.239" end="01:20:03.400" style="s2">come to the conclusion that the ability</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.540" end="01:20:07.090" style="s2">of human beings to turn away from evil</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.400" end="01:20:09.369" style="s2">and to pursue good is more powerful than</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.090" end="01:20:13.389" style="s2">malevolence itself but that&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.369" end="01:20:19.600" style="s2">its funny that&#39;s more of a that fills me</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.389" end="01:20:22.360" style="s2">with with hope and end and awe</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.600" end="01:20:24.610" style="s2">I I guess is the right word when I can</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.360" end="01:20:28.750" style="s2">bring it to mind and think that we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.610" end="01:20:31.510" style="s2">in fact defeat malevolence but sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.750" end="01:20:36.340" style="s2">on a moment-to-moment basis the</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.510" end="01:20:42.219" style="s2">malevolence is so palpable and so real</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.340" end="01:20:45.190" style="s2">that it&#39;s a more powerful it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.219" end="01:20:47.230" style="s2">powerful motivator for for avoidance I</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.190" end="01:20:49.510" style="s2">don&#39;t mean avoidance of responsibility I</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.230" end="01:20:51.580" style="s2">mean avoidance of walking down that path</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.510" end="01:20:52.590" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s probably in keeping</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.580" end="01:20:55.060" style="s2">with the cycle of well-known</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.590" end="01:20:57.040" style="s2">psychological doctrine that people are</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.060" end="01:20:59.500" style="s2">more loss averse than they are gain</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.040" end="01:21:02.980" style="s2">sensitive you know so a loss of</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.500" end="01:21:05.110" style="s2">Eck&#39;s it upsets you more to lose five</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.980" end="01:21:07.210" style="s2">dollars than it does make you happy to</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.110" end="01:21:10.870" style="s2">gain five dollars that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.210" end="01:21:12.460" style="s2">well-known psychological fact and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.870" end="01:21:14.080" style="s2">because we&#39;re more sensitive to</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.460" end="01:21:17.080" style="s2">punishment and negative emotion and</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.080" end="01:21:21.310" style="s2">that&#39;s because well you can die in agony</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.080" end="01:21:24.460" style="s2">but you can only be so happy so yes I</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.310" end="01:21:26.170" style="s2">certainly act as if the devil exists I</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.460" end="01:21:29.550" style="s2">would say and I think I probably</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.170" end="01:21:31.630" style="s2">believed in the devil so to speak</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.550" end="01:21:34.120" style="s2">speaking metaphorically before I</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.630" end="01:21:36.400" style="s2">believed in God speaking metaphorically</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.120" end="01:21:40.150" style="s2">I became convinced of the reality of</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.400" end="01:21:41.980" style="s2">evil and that really and not only that</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.150" end="01:21:45.880" style="s2">not only convinced of the reality of</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.980" end="01:21:47.590" style="s2">evil but also convinced that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.880" end="01:21:49.750" style="s2">was destined to play their part in that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.590" end="01:21:52.150" style="s2">including me and that it would be better</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.750" end="01:21:53.650" style="s2">if I played the least part in that as</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.150" end="01:21:55.780" style="s2">possible you know and that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.650" end="01:21:58.750" style="s2">brings us back to this book you know as</p>

<p begin="01:22:42.850" end="01:22:46.350" style="s2">overwhelming experience for example to</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.890" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">go out and do these lectures they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.350" end="01:22:50.590" style="s2">unbelievably positive experiences to see</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:53.460" style="s2">all these thousands of people come out</p>
