<p begin="00:00:06.819" end="00:00:15.190" style="s2">attitude towards psychedelics was overly</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.809" end="00:00:16.960" style="s2">I think restrictive I think he had you</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.190" end="00:00:18.310" style="s2">know he wrote some famous letters I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.960" end="00:00:20.020" style="s2">actually released some videos on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.310" end="00:00:21.789" style="s2">channel a video on this channel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.020" end="00:00:23.589" style="s2">been watched over a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.789" end="00:00:25.230" style="s2">times regarding what Jung said about</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.589" end="00:00:28.029" style="s2">psychedelics it was something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.230" end="00:00:30.759" style="s2">caught on and people are very interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.029" end="00:00:34.510" style="s2">in it and you read those comments and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.759" end="00:00:36.550" style="s2">some people you know resonate with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.510" end="00:00:38.350" style="s2">wisdom of the words and other people</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.550" end="00:00:39.610" style="s2">like young and really missing missing</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.350" end="00:00:42.280" style="s2">the point here and of course he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.610" end="00:00:43.480" style="s2">writing before there had been of Gordon</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.280" end="00:00:45.700" style="s2">not even the psychedelic Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.480" end="00:00:48.460" style="s2">even the actual the the sixties</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.700" end="00:00:50.740" style="s2">themselves or at least we couldn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.460" end="00:00:53.200" style="s2">them in in hindsight things were still</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.740" end="00:00:56.110" style="s2">in development and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.200" end="00:00:57.910" style="s2">mescaline and what-have-you and while</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.110" end="00:00:59.980" style="s2">his view I think is fairly too</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.910" end="00:01:01.870" style="s2">restrictive and although from also from</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.980" end="00:01:08.410" style="s2">the anthropological sense as you as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.870" end="00:01:10.330" style="s2">mentioned there is a sense that the one</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.410" end="00:01:12.670" style="s2">of the key issues he speaks to is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.330" end="00:01:14.890" style="s2">importance of well if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.670" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">sort of touch the sphere where the paint</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.890" end="00:01:19.440" style="s2">is made as he turns it if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:22.300" style="s2">to take this rocket ship to some of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.440" end="00:01:25.330" style="s2">material then there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.300" end="00:01:27.370" style="s2">of responsibility in terms of you better</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.330" end="00:01:30.159" style="s2">be prepared to have to really integrate</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.370" end="00:01:32.020" style="s2">this in a way that&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.159" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">destructive of you fundamentally and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.020" end="00:01:37.210" style="s2">right as we as we&#39;ve mentioned this this</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:38.979" style="s2">integration is something that yes of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.210" end="00:01:40.540" style="s2">course takes place within and we can do</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.979" end="00:01:42.760" style="s2">inner work and in a practice but this</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.540" end="00:01:45.610" style="s2">also takes place in relationship and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.760" end="00:01:48.070" style="s2">relationships of context and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.610" end="00:01:50.200" style="s2">issue was with the sixties is that well</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.070" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">yeah we can say certain things about</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.200" end="00:01:55.690" style="s2">Timothy Leary and then and sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:57.909" style="s2">inappropriate kind of crack down as</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.690" end="00:01:59.620" style="s2">motivated by whether economic reasons</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.909" end="00:02:02.020" style="s2">like stupid political reason like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.620" end="00:02:08.440" style="s2">whole bunch of stuff there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.020" end="00:02:11.980" style="s2">sense in which we were as a culture sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.440" end="00:02:14.739" style="s2">of quite cut off from an integration</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.980" end="00:02:17.300" style="s2">with those traditions of our history</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.739" end="00:02:20.510" style="s2">which could be though</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.300" end="00:02:22.580" style="s2">context which could help ground the kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.510" end="00:02:25.220" style="s2">of appropriate integration of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.580" end="00:02:27.470" style="s2">material and so mm-hmm sure having a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.220" end="00:02:30.860" style="s2">kind of spiritual traditionalist</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.470" end="00:02:33.110" style="s2">framework the sort of ritual and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.860" end="00:02:35.900" style="s2">know often maybe shamanistic but sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.110" end="00:02:37.490" style="s2">the initiation framework and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.900" end="00:02:40.220" style="s2">containment that comes with traditional</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.490" end="00:02:44.780" style="s2">practice yes yes yeah and I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.220" end="00:02:47.240" style="s2">sort of presents that the the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.780" end="00:02:49.130" style="s2">that as in this house party you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.240" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">mentioned there&#39;s a certain like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.130" end="00:02:58.990" style="s2">the moment we find ourselves in is one</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:03:01.220" style="s2">that I think opens itself to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.990" end="00:03:03.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a clearing there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.220" end="00:03:05.960" style="s2">available energy there&#39;s this important</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.770" end="00:03:09.710" style="s2">need to to integrate that which has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.960" end="00:03:14.360" style="s2">broken apart and there&#39;s a kind of Wild</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.710" end="00:03:16.520" style="s2">West nurse to some structures that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.360" end="00:03:19.130" style="s2">may come may form now we have loads of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.520" end="00:03:23.690" style="s2">wisdom traditions the lessons in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.130" end="00:03:25.130" style="s2">in a way right well I mean in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.690" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">as you alluded to there was more</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.130" end="00:03:29.300" style="s2">conventional structure but as regards</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:31.580" style="s2">this stuff the 60s had an extremely Wild</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.300" end="00:03:34.130" style="s2">West kind of approach right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.580" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">that&#39;s that and that was the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.130" end="00:03:38.660" style="s2">critique of the the D contextualization</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:40.880" style="s2">and the dis embeddedness of psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.660" end="00:03:42.140" style="s2">in that period right not respecting I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.880" end="00:03:44.420" style="s2">mean you know that a notion of set and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.140" end="00:03:46.970" style="s2">setting but like there already was set</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.420" end="00:03:48.770" style="s2">in setting that was back there it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.970" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">like you have to ask you know the mass</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.770" end="00:03:55.010" style="s2">attack or something what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:56.360" style="s2">with the mushrooms yeah but I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.010" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">you there&#39;s a lot of available energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.360" end="00:04:07.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s extremely open yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">yeah I I hear you on that so an</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.900" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">interesting question I have for you is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.670" end="00:04:17.510" style="s2">and maybe it might be worthwhile to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.410" end="00:04:19.520" style="s2">speak to alchemy a little bit and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.510" end="00:04:21.500" style="s2">kind of mystery that alchemy is shrouded</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.520" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">in and of course Young took a great</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.500" end="00:04:28.280" style="s2">interest in alchemy I myself have found</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:31.330" style="s2">such incredibly helpful and instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.280" end="00:04:35.030" style="s2">and continually</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.330" end="00:04:37.640" style="s2">right possibilities but found in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.030" end="00:04:41.210" style="s2">phrase solve a at coagula which of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.640" end="00:04:42.680" style="s2">course maps so well on to you know how</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.210" end="00:04:48.860" style="s2">we could think from a cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.680" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">perspective and so there&#39;s the alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.860" end="00:04:55.670" style="s2">piece and then there&#39;s the shroud of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:58.940" style="s2">mystery of that I&#39;m interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.670" end="00:05:01.790" style="s2">relationship between young and mystery</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.940" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">societies and I&#39;m also interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.790" end="00:05:06.580" style="s2">that frame being something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">helpful II brought into this and ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.580" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">conversations which can help us</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">understand how to appropriately relate</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:19.250" style="s2">to mystery now right and what the so</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:21.080" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll stop there yeah yeah yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.250" end="00:05:22.850" style="s2">think that actually does really usefully</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.080" end="00:05:25.850" style="s2">tie together and for the psychedelics to</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.850" end="00:05:27.350" style="s2">I mean you know when we talk about there</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.850" end="00:05:30.050" style="s2">having you know having an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.350" end="00:05:33.110" style="s2">cultural context in which can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.050" end="00:05:35.930" style="s2">interpret one&#39;s you know spiritual and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.110" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">initiatory and psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.930" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s true that having something to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:43.460" style="s2">that is highly effective right having</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:46.340" style="s2">something that allows you to to construe</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.460" end="00:05:48.530" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to you and and a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.340" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">making use of it and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.530" end="00:05:52.700" style="s2">right but the tendency very often for</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:56.030" style="s2">people that make that critique I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.700" end="00:06:00.440" style="s2">is to then lapse into a kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.030" end="00:06:02.360" style="s2">sort of retro of shamanism right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.440" end="00:06:05.210" style="s2">like what we have to do is is go back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.360" end="00:06:07.040" style="s2">the original indigenous model now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.210" end="00:06:09.740" style="s2">not to say that the original indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.040" end="00:06:12.020" style="s2">model isn&#39;t a good one right it might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.740" end="00:06:15.860" style="s2">highly effective but like at some point</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.020" end="00:06:17.960" style="s2">somebody made that up right like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.860" end="00:06:20.510" style="s2">experimental process that somebody made</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.960" end="00:06:21.950" style="s2">up some humans made up or you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.510" end="00:06:23.210" style="s2">guess if you have a if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.950" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">different sort of metaphysical frame</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.210" end="00:06:27.740" style="s2">maybe it was delivered to them by by</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:29.330" style="s2">being or beings but the point is like at</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.740" end="00:06:31.070" style="s2">some point they didn&#39;t have it you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.330" end="00:06:32.540" style="s2">at some point some humans got into</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.070" end="00:06:34.370" style="s2">Mexico and the ate mushrooms for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.540" end="00:06:35.720" style="s2">first time and when they did they</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.370" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">started figuring out what the hell they</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.720" end="00:06:39.380" style="s2">were going to do with what was hitting</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:42.710" style="s2">them right there was a real time</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.380" end="00:06:44.040" style="s2">experimental interpretation that means</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.710" end="00:06:47.370" style="s2">that we should</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.040" end="00:06:49.500" style="s2">ignore the practical wisdoms of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.370" end="00:06:51.990" style="s2">humans that have come before us they</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.500" end="00:06:54.060" style="s2">weren&#39;t stupid right they just didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.630" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">correspondingly right we can draw useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.970" style="s2">insights from that but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:48.600" style="s2">necessarily mean if we stop there now</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.970" end="00:07:50.220" style="s2">the Western ethos a lot of a time</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.600" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">unfortunately around these things is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.220" end="00:07:54.930" style="s2">what I like to call a fast food atom</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:57.270" style="s2">bomb ethos right so in the Andes they</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.590" end="00:08:06.360" style="s2">that&#39;s good but no we concentrate it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.050" end="00:08:09.030" style="s2">down to a white powder and then further</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.360" end="00:08:11.820" style="s2">turning into smokeable rocks like we</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.820" end="00:08:15.870" style="s2">essence and then consuming them that</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.610" end="00:08:20.970" style="s2">concentrated into a thing that tastes</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.040" end="00:08:27.090" style="s2">deadlier than food right we saw the</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">the core of the instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.630" end="00:08:38.940" style="s2">technological impulse in sort of the</p>

<p begin="00:08:44.340" end="00:08:48.600" style="s2">sometimes how it gets and you get hints</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.130" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">of that in sort of the Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.600" end="00:08:54.050" style="s2">micro dosing culture which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:56.460" style="s2">the joke right and it&#39;s it&#39;s not a fair</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.050" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">caricature in some ways but like in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.460" end="00:08:59.460" style="s2">sixties it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:02.190" style="s2">turn on tune in drop out right leave</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.460" end="00:09:03.990" style="s2">society and now it&#39;s like take small</p>

<p begin="00:09:03.990" end="00:09:09.720" style="s2">productivity coding for Microsoft or</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.120" end="00:09:11.550" style="s2">whatever you know so there are lessons</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.720" end="00:09:12.360" style="s2">to be pulled from the original context</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.550" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.360" end="00:09:16.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that innovation stops there</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:18.390" style="s2">it means that we respect those models</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.170" end="00:09:19.830" style="s2">and then we innovate and we combine them</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.390" end="00:09:21.840" style="s2">which is what humans do and what we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.830" end="00:09:23.580" style="s2">always done and that&#39;s especially so</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.840" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">when you consider that like it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.580" end="00:09:28.410" style="s2">well and good to go and consult</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">indigenous models for you know ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.410" end="00:09:33.930" style="s2">or for you know psilocybin mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:36.060" style="s2">right but what about LSD it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.930" end="00:09:37.860" style="s2">exist in nature does that mean we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.060" end="00:09:39.900" style="s2">have a relationship with it does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.860" end="00:09:41.610" style="s2">that it&#39;s not a useful tool do we just</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.900" end="00:09:43.800" style="s2">use the same tools since we would use</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.610" end="00:09:45.690" style="s2">for a natural component like the answer</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.800" end="00:09:48.150" style="s2">is we have to make it up and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.690" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">make it up based on what we already know</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.150" end="00:09:52.680" style="s2">and some good inferences and an</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:54.740" style="s2">experimental mindset right we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.680" end="00:09:56.850" style="s2">kind of experiment and make it up and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.740" end="00:09:58.470" style="s2">the reason that I bring this up within</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.850" end="00:09:59.940" style="s2">the alchemical framework is that one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.470" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">the things that I love most about</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.940" end="00:10:09.089" style="s2">alchemy as a kind of counterculture</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">expression of spirituality within the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.089" end="00:10:11.820" style="s2">whole period in which it&#39;s operating</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:13.860" style="s2">because it&#39;s always it&#39;s never the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.820" end="00:10:15.660" style="s2">dominant right alchemy as always</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.860" end="00:10:18.110" style="s2">hermetic could tell the sidelines it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.660" end="00:10:21.180" style="s2">always Gnostic it&#39;s always the weirdo</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.110" end="00:10:22.830" style="s2">spirituality but it&#39;s also deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.180" end="00:10:26.070" style="s2">experimental intrinsically inherently</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.830" end="00:10:27.630" style="s2">and not that you you don&#39;t discover the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.070" end="00:10:30.089" style="s2">alchemists secret recipe and then follow</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.630" end="00:10:33.000" style="s2">all the steps right that&#39;s amateur</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.089" end="00:10:35.490" style="s2">cooking is following the recipe cooking</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.000" end="00:10:38.190" style="s2">is about learning what the components of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.490" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">the operations are you want to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.190" end="00:10:43.220" style="s2">to cook in the kitchen you learn how the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:46.500" style="s2">functions of ingredients work you learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.220" end="00:10:48.839" style="s2">what it means to be sour and what salt</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.500" end="00:10:51.089" style="s2">is good for and right and you learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.839" end="00:10:53.490" style="s2">after you learn how to sautee and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.089" end="00:10:55.500" style="s2">learn how to braise and you learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.490" end="00:10:57.180" style="s2">that you learn operations and you learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.500" end="00:10:59.490" style="s2">things and then you just get in there</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.180" end="00:11:01.380" style="s2">and sometimes you turn out a meal and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.490" end="00:11:03.089" style="s2">it&#39;s frankly it&#39;s dog share because</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.380" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve overstepped yourself and put in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.089" end="00:11:07.020" style="s2">too much tarragon or something but like</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:09.420" style="s2">its intrinsically experimental and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.020" end="00:11:10.710" style="s2">transformational in the way that like</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.420" end="00:11:12.870" style="s2">cooking is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.710" end="00:11:20.340" style="s2">alchemy is like that except what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.870" end="00:11:21.840" style="s2">cooking is being and when I say when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.340" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">say that alchemy and cooking I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.840" end="00:11:24.360" style="s2">really mean that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:27.030" style="s2">you know a lot of people have taken up</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.360" end="00:11:28.950" style="s2">baking in the pandemic and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.030" end="00:11:32.040" style="s2">that was really interesting symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.950" end="00:11:34.050" style="s2">interesting as a neo Union but also just</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.040" end="00:11:38.910" style="s2">like really interesting when I took a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.050" end="00:11:41.220" style="s2">baking 1517 years ago what really threw</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.910" end="00:11:43.740" style="s2">me was how alchemical baking really was</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.220" end="00:11:46.080" style="s2">you take a bunch of garbage that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.740" end="00:11:49.020" style="s2">basically isn&#39;t food and stir it</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.080" end="00:11:50.940" style="s2">together in a bowl and then mysteriously</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.020" end="00:11:52.920" style="s2">there are magical invisible things in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.940" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">there that produce gas or something I</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.920" end="00:11:55.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know you have to punch it a few</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:57.540" style="s2">times when it gets too big and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.830" end="00:12:00.420" style="s2">eventually you put it in under some heat</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.540" end="00:12:02.520" style="s2">and it comes out as perfect golden light</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.420" end="00:12:05.640" style="s2">spongy things that resemble neither</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.520" end="00:12:07.290" style="s2">flour nor water like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.640" end="00:12:08.430" style="s2">deeply magical when you get good at</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.290" end="00:12:09.900" style="s2">making when you could goose like</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.430" end="00:12:10.500" style="s2">pastries and stuff that&#39;s just pure</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.900" end="00:12:15.070" style="s2">sorcery</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.500" end="00:12:18.370" style="s2">right now alchemy similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.070" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">that&#39;s formation all kind of approach to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.370" end="00:12:21.490" style="s2">things and you can see it because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:22.779" style="s2">chemical defects are difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.490" end="00:12:24.910" style="s2">translate in part because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.779" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">records of experiments written in an</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:31.240" style="s2">they&#39;re borrowing from the previous</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.050" end="00:12:33.970" style="s2">masters but basically what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.240" end="00:12:36.069" style="s2">they get a few core precepts right they</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.970" end="00:12:37.509" style="s2">get Solvay at Caligula and these things</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.069" end="00:12:40.180" style="s2">are heuristics they&#39;re guidelines they</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.509" end="00:12:42.220" style="s2">just like try to remember right you get</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.180" end="00:12:44.290" style="s2">the axiom of Maria prophet ISA right the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.220" end="00:12:45.730" style="s2">one baguettes the two the two baguettes</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.290" end="00:12:48.130" style="s2">the three which gets the fourth that is</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.130" end="00:12:53.199" style="s2">day and contemplate what that means you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.370" end="00:12:55.300" style="s2">know you get some of the you know you</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.199" end="00:12:57.639" style="s2">get salt you get sulphur you get mercury</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.300" end="00:12:59.500" style="s2">you get the four elements you get the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.639" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">various sort of astrological things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.500" end="00:13:02.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff you can absorb in</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:05.050" style="s2">operations but at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.980" end="00:13:07.810" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is experimental an</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.050" end="00:13:09.339" style="s2">idiosyncratic you start out and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.810" end="00:13:11.399" style="s2">if the goal is to turn the primal</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.339" end="00:13:14.380" style="s2">material the base matter into</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.399" end="00:13:17.110" style="s2">philosophical gold right it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.380" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">question one what&#39;s the base matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.110" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">well what&#39;s most base and then people</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:25.779" style="s2">find all kinds of things you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:27.699" style="s2">dirt dead bodies lead you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.779" end="00:13:29.649" style="s2">most base like and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.699" end="00:13:31.149" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s like starting from</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.649" end="00:13:32.769" style="s2">this weird thing it&#39;s like having a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.149" end="00:13:34.810" style="s2">formula but not knowing what any of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.769" end="00:13:37.329" style="s2">components in it mean right so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.810" end="00:13:40.029" style="s2">imitative it&#39;s not imitative in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.329" end="00:13:43.029" style="s2">ritual sense that absorbing a standard</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.029" end="00:13:44.949" style="s2">catechism or something is imitative you</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.029" end="00:13:46.690" style="s2">go to church you learn it wrote wrote</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.949" end="00:13:48.699" style="s2">like I&#39;m not Catholic but my mom&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.690" end="00:13:51.370" style="s2">Catholic so I went to Catholic Church as</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.699" end="00:13:52.839" style="s2">a kid and I consider Catholicism quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.370" end="00:13:56.860" style="s2">beautiful I lift I wish they&#39;d stuck</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.839" end="00:13:58.329" style="s2">with the Latin but anyway um but you</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.860" end="00:13:59.980" style="s2">know you learn the routine you learn</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.329" end="00:14:01.329" style="s2">when you stand up you learn when you sit</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.980" end="00:14:02.980" style="s2">down you learn when you shake horns you</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.329" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">learn when they open the book you learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.980" end="00:14:06.370" style="s2">when you go up and eat the bread like</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:10.510" style="s2">they&#39;re right and that&#39;s a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.370" end="00:14:12.910" style="s2">of spiritual ritual thing but alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.510" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t that there are some rituals in it</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.910" end="00:14:18.370" style="s2">maybe but then after that it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:20.319" style="s2">fundamentally experimental and if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.370" end="00:14:22.420" style="s2">believe Young&#39;s account the core of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.319" end="00:14:23.470" style="s2">alchemy at least in this particular form</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.420" end="00:14:25.089" style="s2">because for sure there were people that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.470" end="00:14:27.310" style="s2">were just doing chemistry experiments</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.089" end="00:14:28.570" style="s2">and they produced lots of the dyes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.310" end="00:14:30.220" style="s2">glassblowing techniques</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.570" end="00:14:32.590" style="s2">they had important contributions science</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.220" end="00:14:33.910" style="s2">and technology and there were the people</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.590" end="00:14:35.620" style="s2">who really just thought that they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.910" end="00:14:38.230" style="s2">actually gonna get for real gold out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.620" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">it and they also did all kinds of work</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.230" end="00:14:41.140" style="s2">and got good funding from the king of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:43.510" style="s2">Prague and right so there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.140" end="00:14:45.180" style="s2">people at various levels of control but</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.510" end="00:14:48.940" style="s2">for the people who are the like deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.180" end="00:14:52.210" style="s2">imagistic spiritual alchemists there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.940" end="00:14:54.960" style="s2">always this microcosm macrocosm aspect</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.210" end="00:14:58.450" style="s2">which is that in some way altering</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.960" end="00:15:00.820" style="s2">myself alters the world and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.450" end="00:15:02.680" style="s2">the world alters myself and you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.820" end="00:15:04.360" style="s2">treat that you know you can step back</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.680" end="00:15:06.340" style="s2">and scoff at it from a modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.360" end="00:15:08.080" style="s2">perspective and treat it as though</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.340" end="00:15:11.700" style="s2">that&#39;s like I don&#39;t know some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.080" end="00:15:15.880" style="s2">dumb superstition or like you know weird</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.700" end="00:15:18.130" style="s2">unverifiable or you can kind of and say</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.880" end="00:15:20.530" style="s2">well what would that mean charitably and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.130" end="00:15:22.150" style="s2">if you start doing that I&#39;ve had good</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.530" end="00:15:24.130" style="s2">luck using cognitive science could do it</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.150" end="00:15:27.280" style="s2">I try to sort of inhabit what would that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.130" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">mean and like if you do that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.280" end="00:15:31.810" style="s2">obviously trivially true like of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:33.370" style="s2">we project ourselves into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.810" end="00:15:35.830" style="s2">environment people project all the time</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.370" end="00:15:39.130" style="s2">we take it as a matter of course right</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.830" end="00:15:41.790" style="s2">we have to you know I&#39;m I often say to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.130" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">my students for instance right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.790" end="00:15:48.790" style="s2">fascinated by people&#39;s responses to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:50.410" style="s2">movies right so we go from moral panic</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.790" end="00:15:52.270" style="s2">in for a few years around violence and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.410" end="00:15:54.010" style="s2">movies are kids seeing too much violence</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.270" end="00:15:56.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t know why I grew up on the most</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.010" end="00:15:58.750" style="s2">violent gory sex-filled</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.440" end="00:16:01.270" style="s2">swearing it imaginably failed films I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.750" end="00:16:01.830" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to it well I mean I&#39;m that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.270" end="00:16:04.540" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.830" end="00:16:07.030" style="s2">but actually maybe I&#39;ve just explained a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.540" end="00:16:11.110" style="s2">lot anyway but what I mean is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.030" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">think it&#39;s damaged in burnable way and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.110" end="00:16:15.160" style="s2">sort of I&#39;m puzzled when people suggest</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:16.120" style="s2">that even though it might be sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.160" end="00:16:17.770" style="s2">right there are some kids who are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.120" end="00:16:20.620" style="s2">be really sensitive to it you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.770" end="00:16:22.870" style="s2">to freak kids out but anyway um you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.620" end="00:16:24.670" style="s2">so would people get into fiction okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.870" end="00:16:28.350" style="s2">when you&#39;re watching a movie and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.670" end="00:16:32.680" style="s2">following along and you&#39;re invested okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.350" end="00:16:34.390" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not real but who is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.680" end="00:16:36.580" style="s2">who&#39;s the you that knows that it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.390" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">real on one level you know it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.580" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">but on another level you clearly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:41.960" style="s2">because if you did you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:45.380" style="s2">experience emotional reaction</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.960" end="00:16:47.330" style="s2">to what was happening right like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.380" end="00:16:48.830" style="s2">just it&#39;s just really obviously true</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.330" end="00:16:50.390" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the best arguments for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.830" end="00:16:53.750" style="s2">psychodynamic hypothesis that I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.390" end="00:16:55.130" style="s2">think of and it&#39;s like yeah on one level</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.750" end="00:16:58.040" style="s2">if I turn to you in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.130" end="00:17:00.140" style="s2">movie and I say are werewolves real you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.040" end="00:17:02.810" style="s2">will say no werewolves are not real</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.140" end="00:17:05.240" style="s2">although who knows really but werewolves</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.810" end="00:17:07.580" style="s2">are not real aliens are not real right</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.240" end="00:17:10.430" style="s2">Marvel superheroes are not real and yet</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.580" end="00:17:12.530" style="s2">you are you will experience highs and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.430" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">lows of emotional connection and notably</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.530" end="00:17:15.860" style="s2">the predictability of that stuff doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:17.450" style="s2">matter either right stories can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.860" end="00:17:19.670" style="s2">highly predictable a good</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.450" end="00:17:21.890" style="s2">well-constructed rom-com always has the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.670" end="00:17:24.589" style="s2">same structure boy meets girl boy loses</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.890" end="00:17:26.120" style="s2">girl boy gets girl back and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.589" end="00:17:29.060" style="s2">that the beauty of that structure is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.120" end="00:17:31.430" style="s2">works every time if you do it right like</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.060" end="00:17:33.530" style="s2">we just like we just like that and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.430" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">like that structure so your investment</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.530" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">in a story right and some people will</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:39.980" style="s2">say things like well movies today are so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:43.160" style="s2">realistic your brain can&#39;t tell the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.980" end="00:17:45.740" style="s2">difference and that&#39;s horseshit it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.160" end="00:17:47.060" style="s2">true because if I go to the park and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.740" end="00:17:49.610" style="s2">watch Shakespeare in the Park</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.060" end="00:17:52.610" style="s2">right where the here in Toronto we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.610" end="00:17:55.130" style="s2">a large Park High Park at the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.610" end="00:17:56.540" style="s2">the city edge anyway we have this big</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.130" end="00:17:58.010" style="s2">park and there&#39;s sort of a natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.540" end="00:17:59.720" style="s2">amphitheater and they stage Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.010" end="00:18:00.890" style="s2">in the summer so you can go and sit on</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.720" end="00:18:03.170" style="s2">the limestone and watch them put on</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.890" end="00:18:04.760" style="s2">these Shakespeare productions I can get</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.170" end="00:18:06.200" style="s2">emotionally invested in Shakespeare in</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.760" end="00:18:07.640" style="s2">the park and maybe he can tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.200" end="00:18:11.240" style="s2">that&#39;s because my brain is mistaking</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.640" end="00:18:13.310" style="s2">what&#39;s happening on stage for reality in</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.240" end="00:18:14.900" style="s2">that sense it&#39;s not because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.310" end="00:18:17.240" style="s2">realistic I can&#39;t tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.900" end="00:18:19.160" style="s2">lissa preposterous it&#39;s obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.240" end="00:18:22.220" style="s2">realistic what I&#39;m emotionally invested</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.160" end="00:18:25.940" style="s2">right why because some other part of my</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.220" end="00:18:28.070" style="s2">mind takes that very seriously okay so</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.940" end="00:18:30.710" style="s2">that&#39;s projection in a nutshell same</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.070" end="00:18:32.510" style="s2">thing you know you have a shitty bearing</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.710" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">you take it out on your partner or your</p>

<p begin="00:19:00.719" end="00:19:05.999" style="s2">right so the idea is given that this</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.809" end="00:19:08.069" style="s2">projection exists the essence of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.999" end="00:19:10.469" style="s2">alchemical project is projection in</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.969" end="00:20:22.139" style="s2">so so we talked at the outset but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.849" end="00:20:24.329" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll make the cut that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.139" end="00:20:25.769" style="s2">I&#39;m an old-school role player so</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.329" end="00:20:27.689" style="s2">role-playing games like Dungeons &amp;</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.769" end="00:20:30.419" style="s2">Dragons I&#39;ve been playing these things</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.689" end="00:20:32.579" style="s2">since I was four or five and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.419" end="00:20:34.769" style="s2">running games as a dungeon master which</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.579" end="00:20:39.019" style="s2">is not primarily an S&amp;M kink thing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.769" end="00:20:42.119" style="s2">this context since since I was like 10</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.019" end="00:20:44.009" style="s2">since I was like 10 and I&#39;m not a I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.119" end="00:20:46.259" style="s2">not a forever DM as they say but</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.009" end="00:20:49.049" style="s2">certainly I run a lot and have run for</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.259" end="00:20:51.389" style="s2">many many thousands of hours my actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.049" end="00:20:54.479" style="s2">if I if I had to say that I had one sort</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.479" end="00:20:57.749" style="s2">terms of hours spent it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.579" end="00:20:59.549" style="s2">role-playing I&#39;ve spent more hours</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.749" end="00:21:00.869" style="s2">playing role-playing games writing</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.549" end="00:21:02.279" style="s2">role-playing games running role-playing</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.869" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">games that I have virtually any other</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.279" end="00:21:06.239" style="s2">activity and deeply infuses the way that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:07.920" style="s2">I think about other things the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.239" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">role-playing games are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.920" end="00:21:14.490" style="s2">because the DNA of things like Dungeons</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:16.710" style="s2">&amp; Dragons has come to be in the past of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.490" end="00:21:18.660" style="s2">the years deeply influential on other</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.710" end="00:21:21.270" style="s2">aspects of recreational culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.660" end="00:21:23.160" style="s2">it definitely informs mass cultural</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.270" end="00:21:24.750" style="s2">phenomena like the popularity of Lord of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.160" end="00:21:26.280" style="s2">the Rings right not the book which</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.750" end="00:21:28.170" style="s2">precedes the m.d. right and is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.280" end="00:21:30.470" style="s2">influence on but the way that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.170" end="00:21:33.090" style="s2">catches in the culture Game of Thrones</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.470" end="00:21:36.090" style="s2">right there there are so many things now</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.090" end="00:21:38.580" style="s2">and like the the broad adoption of geek</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.090" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">culture they start dominance in fact of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.580" end="00:21:42.120" style="s2">geek culture in the pop culture sphere</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.350" end="00:21:44.250" style="s2">right that it&#39;s super heroes and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.120" end="00:21:46.740" style="s2">monsters and space aliens all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.250" end="00:21:48.210" style="s2">was just pure geekery one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.740" end="00:21:51.150" style="s2">that it&#39;s also inflected is that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.210" end="00:21:54.540" style="s2">language the mechanical language of D&amp;D</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.150" end="00:21:55.890" style="s2">has spread out so like Pokemon how many</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.540" end="00:21:57.960" style="s2">kids in the world have played pokémon</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.890" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">while Pokemon have hit points HP that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.960" end="00:22:02.460" style="s2">the nd they&#39;ve got levels that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.140" style="s2">empty being be innovated a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.460" end="00:22:06.420" style="s2">things that we now think of a central to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.140" end="00:22:09.420" style="s2">the kind of game play where you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.420" end="00:22:11.730" style="s2">adopting persona where you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.420" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">pac-man who it&#39;s I&#39;m not sure what pet</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.730" end="00:22:17.010" style="s2">men&#39;s motivations are right instead you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:18.570" style="s2">have this a customizable person and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.010" end="00:22:20.520" style="s2">want to live in their life I reach out</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.570" end="00:22:23.880" style="s2">recently because of lockdown had the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.520" end="00:22:25.530" style="s2">pleasure to finish the witcher 3 which i</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.880" end="00:22:28.220" style="s2">don&#39;t get a chance to buy a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.530" end="00:22:30.630" style="s2">videogames but i have to say it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.220" end="00:22:33.350" style="s2">maybe triumphs in the human spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.630" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">strong but it was very compelling right</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.350" end="00:22:37.830" style="s2">280 hours I put into this thing right</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:40.260" style="s2">and I got other things I got to do like</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.830" end="00:22:41.730" style="s2">it was that kind of compelling and where</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.260" end="00:22:44.190" style="s2">it was compelling it was compelling</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.730" end="00:22:45.900" style="s2">because it borrows these structures from</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.190" end="00:22:50.760" style="s2">conventional tabletop role-playing okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.900" end="00:22:52.440" style="s2">so so the story I want to tell so I run</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.760" end="00:22:53.910" style="s2">a lot of role-playing games and I run a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.440" end="00:22:56.580" style="s2">lot of different kinds and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.910" end="00:22:59.940" style="s2">game that I run for a bunch of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.580" end="00:23:03.090" style="s2">colleagues at the University which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.940" end="00:23:05.340" style="s2">called godlike and godlike isn&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.090" end="00:23:07.710" style="s2">hunting monsters with swords the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.340" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">basic setup of godlike is superheroes in</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.710" end="00:23:12.510" style="s2">world war ii okay so if you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:14.100" style="s2">the first Captain America movie except</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.510" end="00:23:14.760" style="s2">with all of the Avengers and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.100" end="00:23:18.270" style="s2">fighting Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.760" end="00:23:20.370" style="s2">that&#39;s godlike so a bunch of profs and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.270" end="00:23:21.400" style="s2">people right these are people who have</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.370" end="00:23:23.680" style="s2">often Akemi and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.400" end="00:23:25.150" style="s2">in history and superhero films get</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.680" end="00:23:26.980" style="s2">together and we&#39;ve been playing this</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.150" end="00:23:28.750" style="s2">game for five years right try to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.980" end="00:23:31.960" style="s2">together every once in a while and they</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.750" end="00:23:33.820" style="s2">battle Nazis across across Europe with</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.960" end="00:23:35.170" style="s2">super heroic persona I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.820" end="00:23:37.660" style="s2">name names because I know some people</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.170" end="00:23:39.640" style="s2">are are concerned about the impact that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.660" end="00:23:42.130" style="s2">this might have on the perception of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.640" end="00:23:45.610" style="s2">their career so I won&#39;t name names but</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.130" end="00:23:47.860" style="s2">the point is this in the second act of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.610" end="00:23:49.870" style="s2">this long game and like five years is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.860" end="00:23:51.910" style="s2">long time the players have been going</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.870" end="00:23:53.590" style="s2">through this is going someplace where</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.910" end="00:23:54.550" style="s2">the players have been going through a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.590" end="00:23:56.830" style="s2">long thing where they were going through</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.550" end="00:23:58.570" style="s2">the Pacific and the crux of it turned</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.830" end="00:24:01.000" style="s2">out that the villains were a group of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.570" end="00:24:03.640" style="s2">breakaway sect of apocalyptic Buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.000" end="00:24:05.530" style="s2">okay who we&#39;re trying to cleanse the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.640" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">world by dragging it into the lowest of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.530" end="00:24:08.980" style="s2">Ichi Hill that&#39;s what it turned out the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:10.990" style="s2">big plot was that doesn&#39;t matter that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:12.280" style="s2">much they work their way through the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.990" end="00:24:13.960" style="s2">Buddhist temple and finally they come</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.280" end="00:24:16.150" style="s2">across these sort of doomsday device</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.960" end="00:24:18.040" style="s2">that these apocalyptic heretical</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.150" end="00:24:21.400" style="s2">Buddhists have come up with which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.040" end="00:24:23.260" style="s2">called the black Buddha okay and so they</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.400" end="00:24:25.180" style="s2">come on it&#39;s this massive black statue</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.260" end="00:24:27.220" style="s2">which is composed of kind of liquid</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.180" end="00:24:29.470" style="s2">agony as I described it right which</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.220" end="00:24:30.550" style="s2">they&#39;ve been drawing out of people to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.470" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">create something and the idea is to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.550" end="00:24:36.250" style="s2">create a kind of singularity of so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:40.780" style="s2">suffering that it like drags the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.250" end="00:24:43.060" style="s2">down to hell and cleanses okay so fine</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.780" end="00:24:44.680" style="s2">so the day that I was supposed to run</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.060" end="00:24:48.070" style="s2">this game this final game where they</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.680" end="00:24:51.580" style="s2">dealt with the black Buddha I was not in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.070" end="00:24:54.510" style="s2">a good place I was depressed and and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.580" end="00:24:58.150" style="s2">was experiencing really deep waves of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.510" end="00:24:59.800" style="s2">nihilism and anxiety and depression some</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.150" end="00:25:02.260" style="s2">around the environment some around</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.800" end="00:25:04.210" style="s2">politics some around my own aging and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.260" end="00:25:05.710" style="s2">the imminence of death like the sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.210" end="00:25:07.990" style="s2">things human beings deal with but I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.710" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">having a pretty bad run and I was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.990" end="00:25:11.860" style="s2">burnt out with work that didn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:13.540" style="s2">I felt like I was pointed the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.860" end="00:25:17.020" style="s2">but I had been going through a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.540" end="00:25:19.030" style="s2">bleak stretch and I had cancelled the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.020" end="00:25:21.070" style="s2">game the last time because I felt so</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.030" end="00:25:23.020" style="s2">terrible but again it&#39;s coming out to us</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.070" end="00:25:25.210" style="s2">like I can&#39;t just keep canceling like I</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.020" end="00:25:29.290" style="s2">have to get out there and do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.210" end="00:25:30.970" style="s2">right so so first off in the morning I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.290" end="00:25:33.220" style="s2">like I can&#39;t handle this I&#39;m life&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.970" end="00:25:34.210" style="s2">just in a good place I can&#39;t I can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.220" end="00:25:35.830" style="s2">out and perform</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.210" end="00:25:38.379" style="s2">in this way I can&#39;t do spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.830" end="00:25:40.899" style="s2">storytelling interactive storytelling in</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.379" end="00:25:44.950" style="s2">this way and then I made this decision</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.899" end="00:25:46.179" style="s2">and I was like no I am gonna go I am</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.950" end="00:25:48.789" style="s2">gonna go and what I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.179" end="00:25:50.499" style="s2">going to pour myself into this thing so</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.789" end="00:25:53.559" style="s2">here&#39;s what happens they get to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.499" end="00:25:55.749" style="s2">black Buddha and they at first they do</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.559" end="00:25:57.220" style="s2">all the things that players do basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.749" end="00:26:00.369" style="s2">in these kinds of games they shoot at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.220" end="00:26:02.200" style="s2">and that does nothing so embrace this</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.369" end="00:26:04.450" style="s2">pass this over to rebel you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.200" end="00:26:07.809" style="s2">can&#39;t shoot existential horror to death</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.450" end="00:26:09.340" style="s2">so but then gradually because they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.809" end="00:26:10.690" style="s2">smart bunch and they&#39;re concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.340" end="00:26:13.659" style="s2">this sort of thing somebody finally</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.690" end="00:26:15.940" style="s2">realizes right oh the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.659" end="00:26:18.940" style="s2">transform this thing is from within and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.940" end="00:26:21.009" style="s2">so one after another players are like I</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.940" end="00:26:24.749" style="s2">jump inside of it and they jump their</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.009" end="00:26:28.210" style="s2">characters in and at this moment I I</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.749" end="00:26:30.580" style="s2">began to run a kind of I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.210" end="00:26:32.529" style="s2">psycho-spiritual gauntlet on them which</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.580" end="00:26:37.059" style="s2">is to say that I started to issue this</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.529" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">like stream of consciousness for grind</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.059" end="00:26:41.049" style="s2">which was partly based on the concerns</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:42.610" style="s2">of their characters right because their</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.049" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">characters made for a few years their</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.610" end="00:26:45.759" style="s2">characters have well-developed</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">biographies and stuff right so it</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.759" end="00:26:49.149" style="s2">started by drilling into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:50.860" style="s2">deep concerns of the characters like one</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.149" end="00:26:53.740" style="s2">of the characters wife had recently left</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.860" end="00:26:55.899" style="s2">him for a dentist and so I got at that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.740" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">character by questioning the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.899" end="00:27:01.269" style="s2">love but I mean I did it not just is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:03.519" style="s2">love real I did it with the full force</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.269" end="00:27:05.769" style="s2">of everything that I could bring to bear</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.519" end="00:27:07.749" style="s2">in terms of philosophical nihilism and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.769" end="00:27:10.389" style="s2">materialism about love just being</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.749" end="00:27:12.580" style="s2">chemicals and reproduction of robots and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.389" end="00:27:16.299" style="s2">right all that stuff love is not real a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.580" end="00:27:17.830" style="s2">blast oh another character right not</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.299" end="00:27:19.779" style="s2">just the character but also the player</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.830" end="00:27:21.759" style="s2">is deeply concerned with questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.779" end="00:27:24.399" style="s2">around enlightenment right and around</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.759" end="00:27:26.440" style="s2">spiritual alignment and I blasted that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.399" end="00:27:29.320" style="s2">character with enlightenment is a lie</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.440" end="00:27:31.990" style="s2">it&#39;s self delusion it&#39;s brain rotting</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.320" end="00:27:33.429" style="s2">masturbation it&#39;s just your meditation</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.990" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">it&#39;s disturbing yourself off and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.429" end="00:27:36.639" style="s2">checking over the world and like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:39.029" style="s2">brought everything I had to bear and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.639" end="00:27:41.409" style="s2">watch them sort of twist on the pin and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.029" end="00:27:42.970" style="s2">the responses that the players gave in</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.409" end="00:27:44.679" style="s2">those contexts they rapidly figured out</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.970" end="00:27:47.620" style="s2">the game here the game is I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.679" end="00:27:50.290" style="s2">vomit I&#39;m gonna vomit the worst</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.620" end="00:27:53.110" style="s2">blackest things that I can imagine right</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.290" end="00:27:56.020" style="s2">and your job is you are going to summon</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.110" end="00:27:57.940" style="s2">from within your character right and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.020" end="00:27:59.590" style="s2">your own experience something to counter</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.940" end="00:28:01.570" style="s2">that and that&#39;s what they did they</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.590" end="00:28:04.450" style="s2">started giving you the counter-arguments</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.570" end="00:28:06.430" style="s2">well no love is real because dead know</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.450" end="00:28:08.470" style="s2">like enlightenment and wisdom a real</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.430" end="00:28:10.780" style="s2">thing and gradually they sort of shrank</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.470" end="00:28:14.260" style="s2">the black boot away until eventually it</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.780" end="00:28:16.090" style="s2">evaporated and then their characters</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.260" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">walked out quite stunned and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.090" end="00:28:19.780" style="s2">we&#39;re apt to the scene shortly</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:22.540" style="s2">thereafter the players themselves look</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.780" end="00:28:24.250" style="s2">shaken right and they were a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.540" end="00:28:26.590" style="s2">them contacted me afterwards and relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.250" end="00:28:31.240" style="s2">what was that like</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.590" end="00:28:32.620" style="s2">right but notably they really felt that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.240" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">there was something powerful that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.620" end="00:28:37.059" style="s2">had gotten from that there was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:40.790" style="s2">ritual participatory transformative</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.059" end="00:28:43.559" style="s2">experience that goes way beyond</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.790" end="00:28:44.850" style="s2">like I don&#39;t want to give people the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.559" end="00:28:48.630" style="s2">idea this is what&#39;s happening in every</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.850" end="00:28:50.040" style="s2">D&amp;D game I&#39;m a weirdo but but right</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.630" end="00:28:52.530" style="s2">there was this powerful thing that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.040" end="00:28:56.850" style="s2">participated in but also quite notable</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.530" end="00:28:59.340" style="s2">for me was that I left feeling better</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.850" end="00:29:01.290" style="s2">and feeling transformed and why because</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.340" end="00:29:04.679" style="s2">rather than sitting in the dark and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.290" end="00:29:07.260" style="s2">wrestling my own demons I put my demons</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.679" end="00:29:10.380" style="s2">on the table and bodied them and I let</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.260" end="00:29:11.970" style="s2">my friends fight them and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.380" end="00:29:13.650" style="s2">have just done that if I had just sat</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.970" end="00:29:15.690" style="s2">there crying at the table and going</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.650" end="00:29:16.950" style="s2">everything seems bleak we&#39;ve all had</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.690" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">that experience where I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.950" end="00:29:19.830" style="s2">and our friends are like well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:22.590" style="s2">that bad but that&#39;s not what I did</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.830" end="00:29:24.300" style="s2">instead right and I&#39;m not saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.590" end="00:29:26.550" style="s2">like some genius war move it was mostly</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.300" end="00:29:29.220" style="s2">intuition but the observation that I had</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.550" end="00:29:31.320" style="s2">after the fact was right i externalized</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.220" end="00:29:34.260" style="s2">it into something that was symbolic and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.320" end="00:29:35.970" style="s2">then symbolically speaking my friends</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.260" end="00:29:38.340" style="s2">banded together to take the demon on</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.970" end="00:29:40.890" style="s2">with everything they had and I in turn</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.340" end="00:29:42.840" style="s2">was the devil&#39;s advocate I spoke for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.890" end="00:29:44.610" style="s2">demon and not just blasting what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.840" end="00:29:46.080" style="s2">characters believe or what their players</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.610" end="00:29:47.760" style="s2">know sorry what their characters believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:50.250" style="s2">but also the players what mattered at</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:51.510" style="s2">them now you got to be careful with this</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.250" end="00:29:53.850" style="s2">kind of stuff that would be down tree</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.510" end="00:29:56.070" style="s2">crossing in lots of contexts right like</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.850" end="00:29:58.260" style="s2">it almost gots the line with therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.070" end="00:30:01.559" style="s2">techniques and I&#39;m aware of that but at</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.260" end="00:30:04.950" style="s2">the same time I think that marks are</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.559" end="00:30:06.750" style="s2">really powerful it points at something</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.950" end="00:30:09.150" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s something that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.750" end="00:30:11.370" style="s2">yet well understood but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.150" end="00:30:13.140" style="s2">central to my understanding of alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.370" end="00:30:15.809" style="s2">and projection what I call narrative</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.140" end="00:30:17.400" style="s2">alchemy the idea that characters are a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.809" end="00:30:19.620" style="s2">much better substrate for inner</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.400" end="00:30:22.110" style="s2">transformation ultimately speaking than</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.620" end="00:30:24.120" style="s2">chemicals chemicals are predictable but</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.110" end="00:30:26.970" style="s2">so are characters to some extent and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.120" end="00:30:28.740" style="s2">characters absorb our projections more</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.970" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">easily that&#39;s what we&#39;re sad when the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.740" end="00:30:33.480" style="s2">Harry Potter books end and it&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:35.130" style="s2">why people pestered Sherlock Holmes or</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.480" end="00:30:36.840" style="s2">Arthur Conan Doyle to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.130" end="00:30:39.059" style="s2">Sherlock Holmes but they couldn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.840" end="00:30:41.160" style="s2">the idea that this fictional person and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.059" end="00:30:43.080" style="s2">it&#39;s why indeed fictional resurrections</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.160" end="00:30:45.540" style="s2">are so powerful that they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.080" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">dominant spiritual feature of huge</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.540" end="00:30:50.570" style="s2">slices of the planets idea about what</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:50.570" style="s2">religion and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.730" end="00:30:59.230" style="s2">characters so anyway sorry that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.639" end="00:31:01.659" style="s2">of a that&#39;s kind of a long tour but but</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.230" end="00:31:03.159" style="s2">but what I&#39;m saying about alchemy is you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.659" end="00:31:05.919" style="s2">know it&#39;s easy to get locked into</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.159" end="00:31:09.399" style="s2">looking at alchemy in its previous forms</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.919" end="00:31:11.380" style="s2">right as this set of things but the real</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.399" end="00:31:13.330" style="s2">key is to dig into that stuff and figure</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.380" end="00:31:15.399" style="s2">out phenomenologically what is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.330" end="00:31:17.350" style="s2">talking about and then to use the best</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.399" end="00:31:19.149" style="s2">science you&#39;ve got because the alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.350" end="00:31:22.269" style="s2">is the alchemists were using the best</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.149" end="00:31:25.179" style="s2">science they had and young intern is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.269" end="00:31:27.629" style="s2">using the best science he had but it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.179" end="00:31:30.940" style="s2">a hundred years ago almost in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.629" end="00:31:32.350" style="s2">we&#39;ve got some serious advances and if</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.940" end="00:31:33.820" style="s2">you start putting this stuff into</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.350" end="00:31:36.490" style="s2">dialogue with that right</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.820" end="00:31:38.710" style="s2">so like Solvay at coagula it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.490" end="00:31:41.950" style="s2">example right just dissolve and bring</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.710" end="00:31:43.750" style="s2">together I take that as an alchemical</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.950" end="00:31:45.580" style="s2">thing and I take it to mean right</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.750" end="00:31:47.470" style="s2">differentiation and integration it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.580" end="00:31:49.690" style="s2">dayit coagula but i also take that</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:51.700" style="s2">further i think about it in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.690" end="00:31:53.559" style="s2">patterns of structural dissociation that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.700" end="00:31:55.419" style="s2">we see in regular brain functioning in</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.559" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">neural connectivity that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.419" end="00:31:58.330" style="s2">constant areas that are integrating</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.730" style="s2">together and the way that they integrate</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.330" end="00:32:02.049" style="s2">together changes our entire experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.730" end="00:32:04.210" style="s2">of consciousness in the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.049" end="00:32:06.490" style="s2">I mean basically right if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.210" end="00:32:08.110" style="s2">the neural mappings of you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.490" end="00:32:09.940" style="s2">something like psilocybin for instance</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.110" end="00:32:12.370" style="s2">right so radical changes in your sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.940" end="00:32:13.809" style="s2">of being and potential and reality well</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.370" end="00:32:16.210" style="s2">you know it shuts the default mode</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.809" end="00:32:17.500" style="s2">Network off and then you know things</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.210" end="00:32:19.240" style="s2">have to write differently and so you get</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.500" end="00:32:20.500" style="s2">synesthesia whose areas that aren&#39;t used</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.240" end="00:32:22.360" style="s2">to communicating suddenly are</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.500" end="00:32:24.549" style="s2">communicating and right so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.360" end="00:32:27.190" style="s2">a weirdly considered house party you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.549" end="00:32:29.379" style="s2">know and and so all of a sudden you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.190" end="00:32:31.480" style="s2">got a whole new world right and like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.379" end="00:32:33.429" style="s2">stroke of insight sometimes people have</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.480" end="00:32:35.289" style="s2">a sudden you know like a brain in salt</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.429" end="00:32:37.690" style="s2">or something sudden that can reveal an</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.289" end="00:32:39.100" style="s2">entire dimension to their experience my</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.690" end="00:32:40.809" style="s2">procedures which have been linked to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.100" end="00:32:42.549" style="s2">religious experience in some research</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.809" end="00:32:43.690" style="s2">right same thing you know some</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.549" end="00:32:44.889" style="s2">electrical event things are connected</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.690" end="00:32:46.629" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.889" end="00:32:50.200" style="s2">see everything differently things</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.629" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">connected differently so this constant</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.200" end="00:32:56.139" style="s2">flux and flow of the inner landscape in</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">a way I see alchemy as being trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.139" end="00:32:59.980" style="s2">understand the phenomenology and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:01.419" style="s2">mechanisms of what&#39;s happening there and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.980" end="00:33:03.669" style="s2">cognitive science is a brilliant tool</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.419" end="00:33:04.059" style="s2">for that but cognitive science needs</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.669" end="00:33:06.489" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.059" end="00:33:08.469" style="s2">nology to attach to to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.489" end="00:33:10.899" style="s2">understand the inner experience of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.469" end="00:33:12.849" style="s2">and then in turn to use that to look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.899" end="00:33:15.369" style="s2">the works that people have been doing it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.849" end="00:33:17.919" style="s2">from this problem for you know a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.369" end="00:33:19.929" style="s2">thousand years and see what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.919" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">they&#39;ve been doing and then look at that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.929" end="00:33:23.559" style="s2">and say great that&#39;s a pretty good idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:26.830" style="s2">now how can we improve that or how can</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.559" end="00:33:30.759" style="s2">we refine it or how can we streamline it</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.830" end="00:33:34.479" style="s2">you know and that that&#39;s sort of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.759" end="00:33:36.099" style="s2">vision of it yeah you know and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.479" end="00:33:38.169" style="s2">something that applies not just to your</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.099" end="00:33:40.899" style="s2">work because when you do in our work</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.169" end="00:33:42.639" style="s2">that caches that outside of you and some</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.899" end="00:33:43.989" style="s2">inner work is about your relationships I</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.639" end="00:33:45.849" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the whole jam with therapy</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.989" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like well one thing you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.849" end="00:33:49.149" style="s2">have to accept is that repairing your</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:52.570" style="s2">relationship with your mother is going</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.149" end="00:33:56.619" style="s2">to affect you but also right it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.570" end="00:33:59.769" style="s2">to take you doing things with your own</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.619" end="00:34:01.179" style="s2">inner model of your mother and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.769" end="00:34:03.849" style="s2">actually when the locus of work is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.179" end="00:34:07.599" style="s2">usually and it&#39;s just hard for people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.849" end="00:34:08.859" style="s2">wrap their head around but yeah sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.599" end="00:34:11.319" style="s2">kind of went off on a bit of a tear</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.859" end="00:34:14.369" style="s2">there but I get enthusiastic no I</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.319" end="00:34:18.819" style="s2">appreciate it and it&#39;s really good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.369" end="00:34:23.409" style="s2">so some particularly powerful themes and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.819" end="00:34:25.149" style="s2">here I wonder if we can weave in mmm</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.409" end="00:34:27.190" style="s2">let&#39;s see if it might be possible to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.149" end="00:34:29.740" style="s2">weave in some themes relating to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.190" end="00:34:32.710" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone relating to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.740" end="00:34:34.899" style="s2">cycloid relating to the illness mundus</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.710" end="00:34:39.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s your job but I&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.899" end="00:34:42.279" style="s2">something okay and also a mercurius</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.960" end="00:34:45.039" style="s2">we&#39;re getting the heavy the heavy deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.279" end="00:34:47.379" style="s2">esoteric stuff okay yeah but but it but</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.039" end="00:34:49.809" style="s2">I want to ground it in this because</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.379" end="00:34:56.679" style="s2">you&#39;ve if I think service dust here with</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.809" end="00:35:00.029" style="s2">with and like a real live example of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.679" end="00:35:02.380" style="s2">five year journey of deep play and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.029" end="00:35:06.579" style="s2">transformation through play that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.380" end="00:35:10.599" style="s2">this five year five year story that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.579" end="00:35:12.730" style="s2">participated in creating culminating in</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.599" end="00:35:17.370" style="s2">at least this particular chapter with</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.730" end="00:35:21.570" style="s2">the this event of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.370" end="00:35:24.030" style="s2">liquid agony and an opportunity both for</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.570" end="00:35:26.760" style="s2">you and for your fellow players to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.030" end="00:35:28.850" style="s2">relate on either side although both of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.760" end="00:35:31.890" style="s2">you relating to both sides because of</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.850" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">dynamism of that relationship of how we</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.890" end="00:35:37.380" style="s2">come to terms with and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:39.270" style="s2">transform through be that which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.380" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">before and be that which is after a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.270" end="00:35:46.020" style="s2">confrontation with all that within us</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:48.120" style="s2">might struggle against various</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.020" end="00:35:50.820" style="s2">vicissitudes of being and struggle</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.120" end="00:35:54.630" style="s2">against the the void of meaninglessness</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.820" end="00:35:58.410" style="s2">we we can face as existential finite</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.630" end="00:36:03.660" style="s2">beings and yet still then feel into and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.410" end="00:36:06.570" style="s2">touch together that which can ground us</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.660" end="00:36:10.020" style="s2">in its groundlessness a kind of love a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.570" end="00:36:13.020" style="s2">kind of a meaning in being here together</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.020" end="00:36:15.660" style="s2">and a deep appreciation for that whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.020" end="00:36:19.230" style="s2">process so truly alchemy as I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.660" end="00:36:21.330" style="s2">you define and how resonates very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.230" end="00:36:25.260" style="s2">with me this way as the art of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.330" end="00:36:28.500" style="s2">transformation and so with this as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.260" end="00:36:32.670" style="s2">framing what what strikes me is that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.500" end="00:36:34.350" style="s2">alignment of the characters and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.670" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">yourself as sort of hold her in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.350" end="00:36:39.330" style="s2">space but importantly the structures of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:43.230" style="s2">that game that&#39;s been created that in</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.330" end="00:36:45.150" style="s2">the alignment then is not only that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.230" end="00:36:46.410" style="s2">inner alignment to be found within the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.150" end="00:36:48.270" style="s2">individual but that there was an</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.410" end="00:36:49.700" style="s2">appropriateness of relationship which</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.270" end="00:36:51.840" style="s2">yes blurs the boundaries but</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.700" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">appropriately looks to blur the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.840" end="00:36:55.860" style="s2">boundaries between this kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.420" style="s2">could be a therapeutic environment but</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.860" end="00:36:59.610" style="s2">then also a kind of deep play but</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.420" end="00:37:03.690" style="s2">something transformative you know such</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.610" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">subtlety and mastery required to utilize</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.690" end="00:37:07.950" style="s2">this boundary appropriately is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:10.830" style="s2">particularly for the kinds of world</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.950" end="00:37:13.350" style="s2">building and culture making on the cusp</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.830" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">and in front of us right now because too</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.350" end="00:37:16.770" style="s2">much therapy and we&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">different but without coming from that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.770" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">appropriateness of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:23.340" style="s2">capacity capacity what is proximal to</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve created in ourselves which can</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.600" end="00:39:40.650" style="s2">step into novel territory but this</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:41.880" style="s2">clearing that we&#39;re a part of the harken</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.650" end="00:39:44.940" style="s2">back to earlier parts in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.880" end="00:39:45.240" style="s2">conversation I think it it um it begs of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.940" end="00:39:47.310" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.240" end="00:39:50.100" style="s2">it begs of us to create something</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.310" end="00:39:53.400" style="s2">together which is capable of attending</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.100" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">to and transforming artfully in relation</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.400" end="00:39:58.440" style="s2">to the chaos that&#39;s swirling around us</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:01.110" style="s2">and through there there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.440" end="00:40:03.270" style="s2">opportunity for genuine thriving and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.110" end="00:40:06.140" style="s2">creation but also something that can</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.270" end="00:40:08.610" style="s2">hold as well the reality of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.140" end="00:40:14.690" style="s2">requirement we have to be together also</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.610" end="00:40:18.930" style="s2">in our suffering now okay so there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.690" end="00:40:23.810" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s say there are errors along</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.930" end="00:40:26.369" style="s2">the way there are paths which may be</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.810" end="00:40:28.140" style="s2">real paths to walk but that do</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.369" end="00:40:29.910" style="s2">importantly do not further and we might</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.140" end="00:40:33.660" style="s2">need to wind our way back to something</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.910" end="00:40:35.810" style="s2">that is more wholesome and degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.660" end="00:40:38.369" style="s2">and moving towards let&#39;s say the light</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.810" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">but to hold that an appropriate relation</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.369" end="00:40:44.490" style="s2">and something which can appear as though</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:46.380" style="s2">a mirage there to differentiate them</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.490" end="00:40:49.310" style="s2">between mirages and the real water in</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.380" end="00:40:51.810" style="s2">the desert hey I wondered the role that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.310" end="00:40:53.490" style="s2">Mercurius could play in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.810" end="00:40:55.230" style="s2">thing like this because what we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.490" end="00:40:57.600" style="s2">touching if we are touching that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.230" end="00:41:00.869" style="s2">echo of our time which stands before us</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.600" end="00:41:04.380" style="s2">hey like through the liquid agony then</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.869" end="00:41:06.840" style="s2">connected it to the game that which</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.380" end="00:41:09.600" style="s2">makes possible that transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.840" end="00:41:12.990" style="s2">movement toward something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.600" end="00:41:15.390" style="s2">directionality is moving together we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.990" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">also as well speaking in the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.390" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">of the self the landscape of of God and</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:26.490" style="s2">the sacred as we as we encounter it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:28.320" style="s2">what what can happen is that we can that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.490" end="00:41:30.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a relation to hold very much</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.320" end="00:41:32.100" style="s2">appropriately right this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.180" end="00:41:33.660" style="s2">between ego and self and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.100" end="00:41:35.730" style="s2">constellation of these archetypes these</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.660" end="00:41:37.950" style="s2">alignment of players has to be such that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.730" end="00:41:39.960" style="s2">they bring their appropriate skills and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.950" end="00:41:42.119" style="s2">talents to bear in a certain formation</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.960" end="00:41:44.520" style="s2">with certain timing knowing that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.119" end="00:41:47.880" style="s2">are playing roles and are over the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.520" end="00:41:50.490" style="s2">but do not necessarily write they do not</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.880" end="00:41:53.730" style="s2">stand for the whole absent their</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.490" end="00:41:58.140" style="s2">relations and they&#39;re just so the part</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.730" end="00:41:59.089" style="s2">they play their part and I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.140" end="00:42:01.849" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.089" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">of the trickster and I I could say much</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.849" end="00:42:07.729" style="s2">on this maybe for further conversations</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:09.140" style="s2">but how and and I interested in linking</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.729" end="00:42:10.249" style="s2">this with the kind of philosopher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.140" end="00:42:13.039" style="s2">stone which you might have to give an</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.249" end="00:42:16.249" style="s2">articulation of but what what is it we</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.039" end="00:42:19.279" style="s2">have to be wary of or what&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.249" end="00:42:21.049" style="s2">playing we can do that ultimately plays</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.279" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">with ourselves in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.049" end="00:42:27.170" style="s2">prevents an appropriate revealing of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.319" end="00:42:32.329" style="s2">water and can be instead mirages yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.170" end="00:42:33.950" style="s2">right so I&#39;m writing a book which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.329" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">been sort of collecting chunks on and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.950" end="00:42:39.289" style="s2">planto sort of earnest over the summer</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:41.059" style="s2">which which relates to a bunch of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.289" end="00:42:42.829" style="s2">material and the working title of my</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.059" end="00:42:45.109" style="s2">book which is a bit tongue-in-cheek but</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.829" end="00:42:48.609" style="s2">not that tongue-in-cheek which is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.109" end="00:42:52.420" style="s2">a good metaphor for serious play is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.609" end="00:42:55.039" style="s2">shape-shifting a practical guide now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.420" end="00:42:58.369" style="s2">really trying to tap into something</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.039" end="00:43:00.259" style="s2">about Mercurius and the way that I I</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.369" end="00:43:03.079" style="s2">mean to talk about my curious okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.259" end="00:43:07.369" style="s2">what&#39;s more curious my curious is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.079" end="00:43:10.309" style="s2">funny intercessory or bridging figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.369" end="00:43:11.979" style="s2">within symbolism you sometimes encounter</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.309" end="00:43:15.140" style="s2">and with dream but the idea is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.979" end="00:43:17.539" style="s2">curiously another male nor female and is</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.140" end="00:43:19.640" style="s2">possibly you know sort of the Son of God</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.539" end="00:43:22.130" style="s2">and the devil sometimes expressed that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.640" end="00:43:24.309" style="s2">way he has a paradoxical quality and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.130" end="00:43:27.019" style="s2">shifting quality this right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.309" end="00:43:29.210" style="s2">mercurial he&#39;s more curious but more</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.019" end="00:43:32.210" style="s2">than just sort of mercury the speedster</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.210" end="00:43:35.719" style="s2">or Hermes the wise he&#39;s got this trick</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.210" end="00:43:37.700" style="s2">story twinkle and as I smirk you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.719" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">kind of thing going on he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.700" end="00:43:42.170" style="s2">interesting figure and we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:43.819" style="s2">separately at some point about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.170" end="00:43:45.229" style="s2">appearance of this figure in dreams if</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.819" end="00:43:46.849" style="s2">people are interested a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.229" end="00:43:48.950" style="s2">account of my curious you should track</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.849" end="00:43:49.849" style="s2">down there&#39;s a comic a dream comic by</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.950" end="00:43:53.390" style="s2">Rick Veidt</p>

<p begin="00:43:56.569" end="00:44:02.509" style="s2">but in the last couple of years he</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.769" end="00:44:04.849" style="s2">issued issue 22 and 23 where there was a</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.509" end="00:44:06.140" style="s2">20-year gap in producing this comic when</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.849" end="00:44:08.869" style="s2">he came back it turns out he&#39;s hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.140" end="00:44:11.299" style="s2">Union and so this is a awesome comic</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.550" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">an awesome mercurius let me say so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.619" end="00:44:29.720" style="s2">mercury assists this figure and macarius</p>

<p begin="00:44:37.550" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">you have to consider it is right for us</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:47.150" style="s2">at the conscious level things are almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:50.119" style="s2">necessarily intrinsically polarized and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.150" end="00:44:53.750" style="s2">aspectual okay so we tend to see through</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.119" end="00:44:56.650" style="s2">some pairs of opposites and and in some</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.650" end="00:45:00.619" style="s2">differences so if you look at like that</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.470" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty consistent finding in</p>

<p begin="00:45:44.329" end="00:45:49.640" style="s2">at length I actually was just on another</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.240" end="00:45:50.990" style="s2">podcast awhile ago a Ben voices podcast</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.640" end="00:45:53.299" style="s2">we did an episode I talked a bit about</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.299" end="00:45:55.490" style="s2">check that out and a bit about some</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.410" end="00:45:56.890" style="s2">other experiments let&#39;s fans but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.490" end="00:45:59.480" style="s2">point is okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.890" end="00:46:01.520" style="s2">that&#39;s your conscious level you get</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.480" end="00:46:03.650" style="s2">these polarizations and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.520" end="00:46:06.079" style="s2">things seem opposite is you&#39;re capable</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.650" end="00:46:08.150" style="s2">of switching construal on that so you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.079" end="00:46:10.040" style="s2">know man and woman are often presented</p>

<p begin="00:46:10.040" end="00:46:13.970" style="s2">are they opposite are they opposite like</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.960" end="00:46:16.190" style="s2">black and white or opposite are they</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.970" end="00:46:18.500" style="s2">opposite like positive and negative or</p>

<p begin="00:46:21.799" end="00:46:25.099" style="s2">genetics there are some differences and</p>

<p begin="00:46:25.099" end="00:46:29.730" style="s2">they cause misunderstand</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:31.260" style="s2">right routine misunderstanding but</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.730" end="00:46:32.580" style="s2">people also exaggerate those differences</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.350" end="00:46:38.700" style="s2">that&#39;s in my opinion just not true right</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.170" end="00:46:40.620" style="s2">there&#39;s much more in common the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.700" end="00:46:43.370" style="s2">thing those for other kinds of identity</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.620" end="00:46:46.200" style="s2">differences between humans you know I</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.010" end="00:47:00.390" style="s2">so peculiar until somebody told me they</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.140" end="00:47:03.120" style="s2">loved my accent and I said I don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.600" end="00:47:15.270" style="s2">newscaster anyway it&#39;s right so like</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.110" end="00:47:17.130" style="s2">tiny differences but the differences</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.270" end="00:47:19.410" style="s2">become the point of differentiation so</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.410" end="00:47:23.010" style="s2">opposites well you can treat them as</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.330" end="00:47:24.450" style="s2">cosmic opposites you can treat them as</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.010" end="00:47:26.310" style="s2">where THOG and almost like you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.450" end="00:47:28.140" style="s2">relate them in different ways but some</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.310" end="00:47:30.900" style="s2">people treat them as exclusive opposites</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.140" end="00:47:33.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the realm of consciousness at the</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.440" end="00:48:06.690" style="s2">and pre polarized it contains all things</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.530" end="00:48:09.120" style="s2">and all possibilities right it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.680" end="00:48:29.190" style="s2">like what&#39;s in the middle and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:31.230" style="s2">is Mercurius mercurius is a funny</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.560" end="00:48:48.490" style="s2">sort of show you psychically how there</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.349" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">can be an admixture of these two things</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.490" end="00:48:53.690" style="s2">polarization and non polarization which</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.690" end="00:48:57.230" style="s2">think about my curious it shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.640" end="00:48:58.130" style="s2">lots of ways but one of the big things</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.230" end="00:49:00.410" style="s2">about him is he&#39;s got that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.130" end="00:49:01.790" style="s2">shape-shifting quality and he predicts</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.410" end="00:49:04.030" style="s2">of that because if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.790" end="00:49:06.109" style="s2">it&#39;s like if the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.030" end="00:49:08.300" style="s2">whatever you want to mean that to mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.109" end="00:49:09.859" style="s2">philosophically speaking and or in terms</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.859" end="00:49:14.210" style="s2">cognition or however right the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.109" end="00:49:16.820" style="s2">being is a lot of potential and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.210" end="00:49:19.640" style="s2">your actual state is a lot of actuality</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.820" end="00:49:21.140" style="s2">right and so necessarily it&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.640" end="00:49:23.480" style="s2">that the state of potential is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.140" end="00:49:26.030" style="s2">shapeshifter right it contains an adult</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.800" end="00:51:12.330" style="s2">old enough that I find some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.020" end="00:51:14.610" style="s2">conventions of anime hard to track</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.330" end="00:51:17.370" style="s2">whereas lots of my students and friends</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.610" end="00:51:20.040" style="s2">and loved ones right like anime like I</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.370" end="00:51:21.270" style="s2">was speaking to some siblings of a</p>

<p begin="00:51:21.270" end="00:51:27.150" style="s2">and I said something and they did this</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.970" end="00:51:28.650" style="s2">they went like this and I went blank and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.150" end="00:51:30.630" style="s2">I was like what are you doing and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.650" end="00:51:32.040" style="s2">went like this again and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.630" end="00:51:34.470" style="s2">their sister said oh they&#39;re making the</p>

<p begin="00:51:34.470" end="00:51:39.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve said something embarrassing</p>

<p begin="00:51:39.720" end="00:51:43.050" style="s2">I watch anime it&#39;s just that much</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.730" end="00:51:45.600" style="s2">farther I mean I grew up on enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.050" end="00:51:47.730" style="s2">Western animation that I look and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.600" end="00:51:49.830" style="s2">don&#39;t I can&#39;t track facial expressions</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.730" end="00:51:51.210" style="s2">and stuff I don&#39;t understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.830" end="00:51:52.590" style="s2">conventional is it&#39;s like looking at</p>

<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:52:00.780" style="s2">to be able to get invested but then you</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.110" end="00:52:03.290" style="s2">know play that as as not play is central</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.780" end="00:52:05.940" style="s2">to all this stuff ritual is play</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.290" end="00:52:07.410" style="s2">metaphors are intrinsically play they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.940" end="00:52:09.690" style="s2">both themselves and not themselves</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.410" end="00:52:11.850" style="s2">that&#39;s what play is when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.690" end="00:52:14.550" style="s2">play we talk about animals prance around</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.850" end="00:52:16.350" style="s2">and pretending acting as though they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.550" end="00:52:18.300" style="s2">threatening but they&#39;re not threatening</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.350" end="00:52:20.040" style="s2">that&#39;s the point they&#39;re practicing but</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.300" end="00:52:22.920" style="s2">but they have to be they have to take it</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.040" end="00:52:24.930" style="s2">seriously you can&#39;t half-ass right same</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.920" end="00:52:27.120" style="s2">thing I mean play is so essential this</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.930" end="00:52:29.070" style="s2">is Vygotsky but play and imitation are</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.120" end="00:52:31.890" style="s2">so essential to internalization and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.070" end="00:52:33.900" style="s2">development right because we imitate and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.890" end="00:52:36.660" style="s2">take in other practices and that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.900" end="00:52:38.970" style="s2">essential that that we will do things</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.660" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">that other animals won&#39;t do so do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.970" end="00:52:45.630" style="s2">know like the chimp box no okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:47.430" style="s2">cool experiment so they they take a box</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.630" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s got like cranks and wheels and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.430" end="00:52:51.510" style="s2">whatever and what they do is they put it</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:53.070" style="s2">down in front of that chimp okay and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.510" end="00:52:54.060" style="s2">they turn the crank and they push the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.070" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">button and they do the whale and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.060" end="00:52:58.290" style="s2">pull this little tray and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:52:59.730" style="s2">peanut inside and chimps like peanuts so</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.290" end="00:53:01.290" style="s2">they do this a couple of times and chips</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.730" end="00:53:02.520" style="s2">are smart they&#39;ll watch a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.290" end="00:53:03.750" style="s2">times and then they understand the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.520" end="00:53:05.670" style="s2">sequence and they&#39;ll do the thing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.750" end="00:53:07.810" style="s2">get the peanut and you could do the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.670" end="00:53:08.980" style="s2">thing with toddler human toddler</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.810" end="00:53:10.870" style="s2">right you could show them in this box</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.980" end="00:53:12.190" style="s2">you turn the crank you do the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.870" end="00:53:14.410" style="s2">do the operations you pull the little</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.190" end="00:53:16.030" style="s2">trail there&#39;s candy and the kid will eat</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.410" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">the candy you do it a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.030" end="00:53:20.440" style="s2">the chimp will get it the kid will get</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:21.970" style="s2">it okay fine then the second phase the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.440" end="00:53:24.040" style="s2">experiment is you do the same thing in</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.970" end="00:53:27.340" style="s2">the box the mechanics of the box are the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.040" end="00:53:29.230" style="s2">same except it&#39;s transparent the box is</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.340" end="00:53:31.230" style="s2">transient you can see through and if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.230" end="00:53:33.400" style="s2">see through you can see that the tray is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.230" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">disconnected from all this mechanism the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.400" end="00:53:37.540" style="s2">mechanism is totally superfluous to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:38.740" style="s2">tray so then you do the same thing you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.540" end="00:53:40.900" style="s2">turn the crank you pull the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.740" end="00:53:43.630" style="s2">open the little tray and then you go</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.900" end="00:53:45.400" style="s2">back and what happens is the chimp looks</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.630" end="00:53:45.790" style="s2">at this looks at you like you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.400" end="00:53:47.980" style="s2">idiot</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.790" end="00:53:49.570" style="s2">pulls the tray up and then eats the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.980" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">peanut because it&#39;s just like what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.570" end="00:53:55.810" style="s2">you dumb but the kid will continue to go</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:57.400" style="s2">through all the operations and eat the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.810" end="00:54:00.100" style="s2">candy even once they have seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.400" end="00:54:02.170" style="s2">transparently through the box now the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.100" end="00:54:03.250" style="s2">sort of short form interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.170" end="00:54:06.430" style="s2">that is Wow</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.250" end="00:54:08.080" style="s2">kids are stupid right he&#39;s like chimps</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.430" end="00:54:10.390" style="s2">are smarter than toddlers it would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.080" end="00:54:13.930" style="s2">the low-grade but that&#39;s deeply mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.390" end="00:54:15.850" style="s2">because that&#39;s wrong the fact is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.930" end="00:54:18.340" style="s2">the kid has internalized the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.850" end="00:54:19.720" style="s2">because humans have intrinsically and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.340" end="00:54:22.420" style="s2">this takes us back to the Gosling&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.720" end="00:54:24.760" style="s2">right the geese and the Gosling&#39;s humans</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.420" end="00:54:27.340" style="s2">have a capacity for imitation of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.760" end="00:54:29.530" style="s2">that kid is doing is making a bet a bet</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.340" end="00:54:31.540" style="s2">that although they do not understand the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.530" end="00:54:34.150" style="s2">actions that you the adult are doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.540" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">that there&#39;s a reason for them but</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.150" end="00:54:37.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a payoff to imitating you even</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:39.430" style="s2">though they don&#39;t know what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.780" end="00:54:41.170" style="s2">you can see that with kids all the time</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.430" end="00:54:42.940" style="s2">they do their little tea parties and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.170" end="00:54:44.710" style="s2">they&#39;ll imitate adult actions they</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.940" end="00:54:47.380" style="s2">cannot possibly have an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.710" end="00:54:48.730" style="s2">but they mean my eldest niece she was</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.380" end="00:54:50.260" style="s2">the only child in the mix for a while</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.730" end="00:54:51.610" style="s2">with the whole period of time where</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.260" end="00:54:55.420" style="s2">every time she sat down on the couch she</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.610" end="00:54:56.860" style="s2">would go and I couldn&#39;t understand this</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.420" end="00:54:59.110" style="s2">until I realized that she was a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.860" end="00:55:01.780" style="s2">around old exhausted adults who when</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.110" end="00:55:03.880" style="s2">they would sit down would go ah and she</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.780" end="00:55:05.740" style="s2">just picked it up we love this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.880" end="00:55:08.110" style="s2">when kids do it it&#39;s like Oh a kid said</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.740" end="00:55:10.120" style="s2">but the point is they&#39;re internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.110" end="00:55:11.830" style="s2">things and they&#39;re making a bat and play</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.120" end="00:55:14.140" style="s2">is all about that internalization and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.830" end="00:55:15.460" style="s2">play is essential like it Brides a fine</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.140" end="00:55:19.060" style="s2">line think about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.460" end="00:55:21.190" style="s2">tickling tickling is an interesting form</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.060" end="00:55:23.140" style="s2">of play because if you&#39;re walking home</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.190" end="00:55:24.910" style="s2">from the puppet three a.m. and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.140" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">jumps out of a dark alley and grabs your</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.910" end="00:55:29.950" style="s2">ribs you do not experience that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:32.859" style="s2">tickling yes you experienced an attack</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.950" end="00:55:34.510" style="s2">if somebody that you don&#39;t like puts the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.859" end="00:55:36.760" style="s2">hands on your ribs you don&#39;t experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.510" end="00:55:39.130" style="s2">it as tickling you experience it as an</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.760" end="00:55:41.740" style="s2">attack tickling is a thing that happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.130" end="00:55:44.230" style="s2">when somebody threatens you but they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.740" end="00:55:45.609" style="s2">not threatening you trust them and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.230" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">then you experience this funny</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.609" end="00:55:50.740" style="s2">paradoxical feeling tickling is weird</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:52.650" style="s2">it&#39;s unpleasant but also it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.740" end="00:55:55.630" style="s2">pleasant right</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.650" end="00:55:57.670" style="s2">that&#39;s a very pure instance of play in</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.630" end="00:55:59.109" style="s2">its paradoxical nature it&#39;s as as not</p>

<p begin="01:08:39.080" end="01:08:42.020" style="s2">deeply respect somebody and think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.000" end="01:08:43.460" style="s2">their role</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.020" end="01:08:44.870" style="s2">that you can respect some of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.460" end="01:08:48.170" style="s2">choices and recognize that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.870" end="01:08:51.890" style="s2">yours right and that you can recognize</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.170" end="01:08:54.470" style="s2">that that what they&#39;re doing is in some</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.890" end="01:08:58.400" style="s2">sense in all but the smallest cases</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.470" end="01:09:02.029" style="s2">their best stab at the best way to live</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.400" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">given the damage that they have we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.029" end="01:09:08.359" style="s2">all got damage we&#39;re all traumatized so</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.880" end="01:09:09.950" style="s2">yeah so yeah celeritas and friendship is</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.359" end="01:09:11.870" style="s2">my prescription for how to make this</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.950" end="01:09:13.640" style="s2">stuff fly and that&#39;s why I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.870" end="01:09:14.990" style="s2">house party the interfaith dialogue is</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.640" end="01:09:16.940" style="s2">an interesting metaphor but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.990" end="01:09:18.230" style="s2">abstract and the goal in the interfaith</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.940" end="01:09:20.150" style="s2">dialogue presumably is to create</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.230" end="01:09:21.549" style="s2">friendships because that&#39;s when people</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.150" end="01:09:24.470" style="s2">are going to want to talk about stuff</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.549" end="01:09:26.330" style="s2">yes yeah let me let me add a few things</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.470" end="01:09:28.370" style="s2">in here I mean I I really really</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.330" end="01:09:32.770" style="s2">appreciated that I think it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.370" end="01:09:34.730" style="s2">it&#39;s tremendously wise and unnecessary</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.770" end="01:09:37.430" style="s2">my sense is that there are a couple</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.730" end="01:09:40.279" style="s2">things to to flesh in there much of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.430" end="01:09:42.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve already covered that would there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.279" end="01:09:46.819" style="s2">a bit more for it to create them the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.740" end="01:09:50.589" style="s2">necessary and sufficient because yet to</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.819" end="01:09:52.819" style="s2">sketch yes and and the humor critical</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.589" end="01:09:56.660" style="s2">right relationship obviously with love</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.819" end="01:09:59.680" style="s2">critical horror as well critical though</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.660" end="01:10:04.040" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to go down that path</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.680" end="01:10:06.230" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something about so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.040" end="01:10:07.940" style="s2">a where interfaith dialogue the product</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.230" end="01:10:09.800" style="s2">of that being a kind of friendship yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.940" end="01:10:12.560" style="s2">but then there&#39;s a sense there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.800" end="01:10:16.610" style="s2">deep trust we we have to have this</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.560" end="01:10:20.800" style="s2">capacity to trust in the extend that</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.610" end="01:10:25.600" style="s2">dignity yeah extend the dignity of</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.800" end="01:10:28.580" style="s2">unique participation and irreducible</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.600" end="01:10:31.460" style="s2">value that can only be bestowed through</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.580" end="01:10:34.630" style="s2">that through that other and dignity of</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.460" end="01:10:40.010" style="s2">that the opportunity to live and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.630" end="01:10:42.710" style="s2">co-create it strikes me that beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.010" end="01:10:45.500" style="s2">the trickster and say hey we said the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.710" end="01:10:50.390" style="s2">breaking through but to add a few pieces</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.500" end="01:10:52.280" style="s2">because ended in the story that you told</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.390" end="01:10:54.350" style="s2">this game you&#39;ve been playing for five</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.280" end="01:10:55.670" style="s2">years and created there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.350" end="01:10:59.080" style="s2">which it&#39;s a gathering among</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.670" end="01:11:01.429" style="s2">friends but at the same time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.080" end="01:11:02.739" style="s2">symbolic structure and a structure</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.429" end="01:11:05.690" style="s2">that&#39;s being created which has</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.739" end="01:11:07.310" style="s2">differentiated kind of hierarchy in it</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.690" end="01:11:09.260" style="s2">for example you have someone who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.310" end="01:11:11.210" style="s2">dungeon master and they&#39;re playing a</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.260" end="01:11:12.250" style="s2">certain role and so the friends give</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.210" end="01:11:14.000" style="s2">permission</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.250" end="01:11:15.620" style="s2">give permission so it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.000" end="01:11:17.660" style="s2">complicated in that sense it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.620" end="01:11:19.070" style="s2">form of play partly because this is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.660" end="01:11:21.770" style="s2">thing that people misunderstand if</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.070" end="01:11:23.360" style="s2">they&#39;ve never played the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.770" end="01:11:25.250" style="s2">relationship between the dungeon master</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.360" end="01:11:26.540" style="s2">or the game master the person running</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.250" end="01:11:29.870" style="s2">the game and the players is not</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.540" end="01:11:32.300" style="s2">adversarial mm-hmm it is merely</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.870" end="01:11:34.910" style="s2">apparently adversarial but it must be</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.300" end="01:11:35.330" style="s2">apparently adversarial this is what I</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.910" end="01:11:38.390" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.330" end="01:11:40.429" style="s2">they each play a character I play all</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.390" end="01:11:41.989" style="s2">the supporting cast which means I also</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.429" end="01:11:44.810" style="s2">play the antagonist I play the bad guys</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.989" end="01:11:46.310" style="s2">right and like you know you tend to play</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.810" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">sort of genre stories they&#39;re fairly</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.310" end="01:11:50.750" style="s2">action-oriented because whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:51.830" style="s2">just when it comes out of not that there</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.750" end="01:11:54.860" style="s2">aren&#39;t other ones there&#39;s some really</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.830" end="01:11:56.239" style="s2">great games that just do romance but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.860" end="01:11:59.090" style="s2">can&#39;t get my players on board with them</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.239" end="01:12:00.860" style="s2">anyway but there are some really</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.090" end="01:12:02.270" style="s2">interesting ad designs which is said</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.860" end="01:12:04.850" style="s2">it&#39;s not all just about violence but</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.270" end="01:12:07.760" style="s2">very often it has a kind of action right</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.850" end="01:12:11.150" style="s2">but there is an apparent adversarial</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.760" end="01:12:13.219" style="s2">thing which is to say that my role is to</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.150" end="01:12:14.660" style="s2">embody the adversary right so think</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.219" end="01:12:17.210" style="s2">about me and have it in the black Buddha</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.660" end="01:12:18.350" style="s2">I&#39;m doing my level best right in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.210" end="01:12:21.410" style="s2">same way that if you&#39;re playing a chess</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.350" end="01:12:23.780" style="s2">game with a friend right it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.410" end="01:12:26.900" style="s2">they hate you it&#39;s just you want them to</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.780" end="01:12:28.910" style="s2">play hard you want them to play against</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.900" end="01:12:31.130" style="s2">you if you&#39;re engaged in a debate you</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.910" end="01:12:34.070" style="s2">want the person you&#39;re debating against</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.130" end="01:12:35.690" style="s2">to come with his best shot if they flip</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.070" end="01:12:37.910" style="s2">over just give in or cave in it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.690" end="01:12:39.350" style="s2">unsatisfying same thing if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.910" end="01:12:40.640" style="s2">playing you know I don&#39;t know tennis or</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.350" end="01:12:42.860" style="s2">something right look you want the other</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.640" end="01:12:44.929" style="s2">person to play hard now if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.860" end="01:12:46.790" style="s2">vastly better than you that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.929" end="01:12:48.710" style="s2">great usually right you get kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.790" end="01:12:50.120" style="s2">crushed on it sucks but I have a friend</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.710" end="01:12:53.270" style="s2">who&#39;s big in the strategy games who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.120" end="01:12:54.739" style="s2">one of my gamers and he plays a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.270" end="01:12:56.150" style="s2">strategy games with his brother and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.739" end="01:12:57.469" style="s2">used to play with them occasionally I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.150" end="01:13:00.110" style="s2">get him find it over and I&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.469" end="01:13:03.670" style="s2">destroyed and never won never because</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.110" end="01:13:06.170" style="s2">they both have STIs like these like</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.670" end="01:13:08.360" style="s2">astoundingly sharpened tactical Minds</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.170" end="01:13:09.500" style="s2">and they understand the the structures</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.360" end="01:13:11.000" style="s2">of these games and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.500" end="01:13:14.390" style="s2">million of them so they can just analyze</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.000" end="01:13:17.930" style="s2">strategy immediately so I never won but</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.390" end="01:13:21.440" style="s2">my friend won about maybe charitably 1/4</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.930" end="01:13:24.030" style="s2">of the time and his brother won 3 crew</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.440" end="01:13:26.849" style="s2">so finally I said to him at some point I</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.030" end="01:13:29.849" style="s2">don&#39;t get up man like you take such a</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.849" end="01:13:31.949" style="s2">beating every time and you come up with</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.849" end="01:13:33.420" style="s2">a strategy and it works once and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.949" end="01:13:35.969" style="s2">your brother comes at you like the Borg</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.420" end="01:13:37.559" style="s2">from Star Trek and it&#39;s just like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.969" end="01:13:40.349" style="s2">assimilated your thing and now I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.559" end="01:13:42.840" style="s2">beat you with it and I said I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.349" end="01:13:44.610" style="s2">understand like how is that fun and what</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.840" end="01:13:47.639" style="s2">my friend said made a very deep mark on</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.610" end="01:13:53.520" style="s2">me he said you don&#39;t learn anything when</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.639" end="01:13:57.030" style="s2">you win you don&#39;t learn anything when</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.520" end="01:13:59.699" style="s2">you win and I blinked cuz I was like oh</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.030" end="01:14:01.559" style="s2">my god like you&#39;re right you&#39;re right of</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.699" end="01:14:03.690" style="s2">course like when you win it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.559" end="01:14:05.219" style="s2">confirmation you don&#39;t really pick up</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.690" end="01:14:07.829" style="s2">additional information what you learn is</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.219" end="01:14:09.300" style="s2">that your opponent is not you know if</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.829" end="01:14:11.460" style="s2">you really track somebody you just let</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.300" end="01:14:13.320" style="s2">your opponents not up to snuff if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.460" end="01:14:15.719" style="s2">want to push your game you need somebody</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.320" end="01:14:17.670" style="s2">who&#39;s going to match you so it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.719" end="01:14:21.030" style="s2">apparent adversarial so when low unlevel</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.670" end="01:14:24.270" style="s2">they&#39;re my friends my own level best to</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.030" end="01:14:27.630" style="s2">create the appearance that I am you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.270" end="01:14:29.340" style="s2">out to get them and in younger games I</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.630" end="01:14:31.110" style="s2">run games for a high school so a group</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.340" end="01:14:33.929" style="s2">of high school kids and they have less</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.110" end="01:14:36.150" style="s2">experience and so they all paint me as</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.929" end="01:14:39.030" style="s2">though I&#39;m an adversarial monster right</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.150" end="01:14:40.590" style="s2">Anderson&#39;s gonna kill us all and what</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.030" end="01:14:42.540" style="s2">they of course don&#39;t understand they</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.590" end="01:14:45.920" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to fully absorbed is I have</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.540" end="01:14:48.659" style="s2">the ability to kill them anytime I want</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.920" end="01:14:50.639" style="s2">buddy in the game if I say you all get</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.659" end="01:14:52.590" style="s2">crushed by rocks the end and walk out</p>

<p begin="01:14:52.590" end="01:14:56.610" style="s2">anytime I want to the rules do not</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.599" end="01:14:58.079" style="s2">preclude it right but that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.610" end="01:15:01.020" style="s2">point that would be extremely boring for</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.079" end="01:15:03.420" style="s2">me and for them the point is to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.020" end="01:15:05.250" style="s2">game rolling and to make it satisfying</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.420" end="01:15:06.599" style="s2">there has to be a tension same thing we</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.250" end="01:15:09.030" style="s2">watch a movie we know</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.599" end="01:15:10.710" style="s2">boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets</p>

<p begin="01:15:12.420" end="01:15:19.250" style="s2">present in that you know what I mean so</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.020" end="01:15:23.460" style="s2">there&#39;s this importance than in a shared</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.250" end="01:15:26.750" style="s2">commitment to the value of playing the</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.460" end="01:15:32.219" style="s2">game and that is I would suggest then</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.750" end="01:15:34.600" style="s2">fundamental to the bit that is that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.219" end="01:15:36.970" style="s2">as fundamental as</p>

<p begin="01:15:47.590" end="01:15:52.420" style="s2">people because transcender like what are</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.450" end="01:15:55.540" style="s2">the conditions of that must be in place</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.420" end="01:15:57.910" style="s2">to enable the game making this deep one</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.540" end="01:16:00.880" style="s2">being a deep affirmation and extension</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.910" end="01:16:04.230" style="s2">of the dignity of the status of player</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.880" end="01:16:07.300" style="s2">to another and that this can be realized</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.550" end="01:17:00.160" style="s2">ago right it&#39;s just not that simple like</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.300" end="01:17:01.870" style="s2">their guidelines but guidelines aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.160" end="01:17:04.900" style="s2">rules it&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.870" end="01:17:06.790" style="s2">you know um likewise you know I look for</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.900" end="01:17:09.250" style="s2">people that are exploitative you know I</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.790" end="01:17:11.800" style="s2">look to see and you know you look for</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.250" end="01:17:15.730" style="s2">little things you know I have a very</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.800" end="01:17:18.400" style="s2">finely tuned antennae for cruelty when I</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.730" end="01:17:20.590" style="s2">sense cruelty in people right cruelty in</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.400" end="01:17:21.790" style="s2">their humor or cruelty in right and</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.590" end="01:17:23.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference you can be like</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.790" end="01:17:25.870" style="s2">pretty you could be pretty dark in your</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.950" end="01:17:29.470" style="s2">humor and I will still laugh but I&#39;ve a</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.870" end="01:17:31.960" style="s2">sense cruelty Indian humor I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.470" end="01:17:35.740" style="s2">won&#39;t hold with that I cruelty to me has</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.960" end="01:17:37.540" style="s2">no utility it&#39;s one of the few actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.740" end="01:17:39.460" style="s2">I would say like hard to place</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.540" end="01:17:41.350" style="s2">there are basically like two things I</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.460" end="01:17:43.510" style="s2">can figure in the universe that as far</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.350" end="01:17:45.719" style="s2">as I not I not managed to discern the</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.510" end="01:17:49.920" style="s2">use of yet</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.719" end="01:17:50.430" style="s2">cruelty and rudeness I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.920" end="01:17:53.190" style="s2">they&#39;re for</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.430" end="01:17:54.989" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what good they are root I</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.190" end="01:17:56.430" style="s2">just think there&#39;s never a reason to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.989" end="01:17:58.530" style="s2">rude that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.430" end="01:18:00.150" style="s2">confrontational sometimes you get</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.530" end="01:18:01.560" style="s2">confrontational you can even tell them</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.150" end="01:18:04.590" style="s2">to off and that&#39;s not being rude</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.560" end="01:18:07.800" style="s2">but like rudeness and cruelty I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.590" end="01:18:09.390" style="s2">get I look out for those things for</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.800" end="01:18:11.730" style="s2">other players hey they&#39;re signs for</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.390" end="01:18:14.910" style="s2">other players this person is not yet</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.730" end="01:18:17.400" style="s2">willing able and ready to enter into a</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.910" end="01:18:20.699" style="s2">certain kind of game making that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.400" end="01:18:22.469" style="s2">yeah you know and you can look for other</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.699" end="01:18:25.860" style="s2">kinds of shorthand I mean I used to make</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.469" end="01:18:27.510" style="s2">the joke years ago that if I really</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.860" end="01:18:31.560" style="s2">wanted to know when I started dating</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.510" end="01:18:33.750" style="s2">somebody how they might be as a sexual</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.560" end="01:18:39.030" style="s2">partner I would watch them interact with</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.750" end="01:18:40.530" style="s2">pets cats specifically because if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.030" end="01:18:42.150" style="s2">can get on with against some people hate</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.530" end="01:18:43.920" style="s2">cats and this is a bit of shorthand but</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.150" end="01:18:45.449" style="s2">this is the thing I used to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.920" end="01:18:48.180" style="s2">like if you can figure out how to please</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.449" end="01:18:50.040" style="s2">a cat then what you were good at is</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.180" end="01:18:52.050" style="s2">you&#39;re adept at interacting with a</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.040" end="01:18:55.160" style="s2">nonverbal entity that&#39;s a bit cagey</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.050" end="01:18:57.480" style="s2">about communicating its own pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.160" end="01:18:59.460" style="s2">right but if you can like figure that</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.480" end="01:19:01.920" style="s2">out if you can read a cat then you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.460" end="01:19:04.020" style="s2">how to read on this subtle level what</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.920" end="01:19:07.199" style="s2">the house medics work out and that and</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.020" end="01:19:08.550" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to be a bit you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.199" end="01:19:09.719" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to be experimental</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.550" end="01:19:11.070" style="s2">typically another cat cuz they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.719" end="01:19:12.900" style="s2">all the same and you&#39;re bound to get</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.070" end="01:19:14.850" style="s2">scratched you&#39;re willing to take risks</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.900" end="01:19:17.310" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to be experimental like</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.850" end="01:19:19.110" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s it&#39;s a slightly glib</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.310" end="01:19:21.210" style="s2">shorthand but nevertheless it&#39;s in some</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.110" end="01:19:21.719" style="s2">ways a useful shorthand and those sorts</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.210" end="01:19:24.090" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.719" end="01:19:26.310" style="s2">how people behave with how people behave</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.090" end="01:19:30.270" style="s2">with children dreamily telling to me</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.310" end="01:19:32.190" style="s2">right how people behave with the with</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.270" end="01:19:34.290" style="s2">their parents right how somebody treats</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.190" end="01:19:36.510" style="s2">their parents it&#39;s often very telling</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.290" end="01:19:39.210" style="s2">how somebody interacts with their their</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.510" end="01:19:41.640" style="s2">lover their partner is very telling how</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.210" end="01:19:43.650" style="s2">people you know comport themselves in</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.640" end="01:19:45.300" style="s2">debate is telling and all these things</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.650" end="01:19:47.340" style="s2">you can look at you could be like what</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.300" end="01:19:50.310" style="s2">does that mean what what could I infer</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.340" end="01:19:53.190" style="s2">from that - playing the big game the</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.310" end="01:19:55.469" style="s2">game the great work so like I used</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.190" end="01:19:58.189" style="s2">somebody who I want to be involved in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.469" end="01:20:00.320" style="s2">sort of at the spiritual level as right</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.189" end="01:20:02.090" style="s2">and the answer its most of time yes but</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.320" end="01:20:03.019" style="s2">like you need to know you know what</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.090" end="01:20:05.719" style="s2">you&#39;re getting into</p>

<p begin="01:23:09.200" end="01:23:15.710" style="s2">mystery of that so these times then yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.050" end="01:23:17.240" style="s2">please okay so so okay so maybe I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.710" end="01:23:20.930" style="s2">speak from the practical and then bridge</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.240" end="01:23:21.860" style="s2">up okay the metaphysical so okay you</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.930" end="01:23:25.100" style="s2">know the whole thing you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.860" end="01:23:29.600" style="s2">about this kind of right the the the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.100" end="01:23:32.540" style="s2">clearing and the you know the agent sort</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.600" end="01:23:35.450" style="s2">of arena space in which we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.540" end="01:23:38.540" style="s2">whatever this distributed cognition and</p>

<p begin="01:23:38.540" end="01:23:48.410" style="s2">into that you know what does that look</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.970" end="01:23:51.650" style="s2">like it looks like this right like I</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.410" end="01:23:53.870" style="s2">like you this was fun thank you right</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.650" end="01:23:56.660" style="s2">but but that&#39;s important like what do we</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.870" end="01:23:58.250" style="s2">do we traded conceptualizations and</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.660" end="01:23:59.900" style="s2">language pieces tax some of which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.250" end="01:24:01.580" style="s2">absorbed from common sources some of</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.900" end="01:24:02.900" style="s2">which we put on the table right now to</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.580" end="01:24:05.000" style="s2">try to talk about some that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.900" end="01:24:06.980" style="s2">interested in and about right about</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.000" end="01:24:08.120" style="s2">ourselves and about our past and about</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.980" end="01:24:10.250" style="s2">where we&#39;re going and about where</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.120" end="01:24:11.570" style="s2">everybody&#39;s going and and it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.250" end="01:24:12.800" style="s2">interesting it was interesting just we</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.570" end="01:24:14.240" style="s2">both brought different things to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.800" end="01:24:15.890" style="s2">table and it was cool and we could see</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.240" end="01:24:17.440" style="s2">how those things click together and it</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.890" end="01:24:21.950" style="s2">opened more questions than it closed</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.440" end="01:24:25.130" style="s2">right it looks like this and you know a</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.950" end="01:24:27.320" style="s2">thing I&#39;m gonna talk about this much but</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.130" end="01:24:28.570" style="s2">I have a close relationship with John</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.320" end="01:24:33.710" style="s2">for Vickie</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.570" end="01:24:36.590" style="s2">and you know he was something of a</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.710" end="01:24:40.310" style="s2">mentor to me but I I took classes with</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.590" end="01:24:43.250" style="s2">him late enough in life that like I was</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.310" end="01:24:44.780" style="s2">in my late 20s by the time like because</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.250" end="01:24:46.639" style="s2">I was a high school dropout and I had a</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.780" end="01:24:48.500" style="s2">number of other career arcs in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.639" end="01:24:51.170" style="s2">middle so by the time I kind of came to</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.500" end="01:24:53.000" style="s2">do school in that way by the time I</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.170" end="01:24:55.460" style="s2">reconciled myself to institutional</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.000" end="01:24:57.230" style="s2">education I was I&#39;d done my own tour and</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.460" end="01:25:00.050" style="s2">I&#39;d done quite a bit of my own work and</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.230" end="01:25:01.880" style="s2">I had done a lot of conceptualization so</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.050" end="01:25:03.560" style="s2">I knew actually John from way back</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.880" end="01:25:05.060" style="s2">friends mine had him as a prof and</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.560" end="01:25:07.730" style="s2">weirdly he was my best friend&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.060" end="01:25:10.100" style="s2">therapist totally disconnected from that</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.730" end="01:25:14.090" style="s2">back when he did that but so when I</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.100" end="01:25:16.040" style="s2">reencounter John partly what I what</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.090" end="01:25:18.620" style="s2">resonated with me was that he had a</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.040" end="01:25:21.380" style="s2">tremendously developed language I mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.620" end="01:25:23.900" style="s2">John the thing about John is he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.380" end="01:25:25.070" style="s2">performative right I&#39;m sure there are</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.900" end="01:25:27.620" style="s2">people out there who think he&#39;s a faker</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.070" end="01:25:29.449" style="s2">but but John is just like if John if the</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.620" end="01:25:30.980" style="s2">University exploded tomorrow John would</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.449" end="01:25:33.170" style="s2">do exactly the same thing as he did the</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.980" end="01:25:35.690" style="s2">day before he would continue to work on</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.170" end="01:25:39.199" style="s2">this stuff because he he lives it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.690" end="01:25:41.960" style="s2">just who he is right and that gave an</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.199" end="01:25:44.659" style="s2">acuity and Ana clarity and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.960" end="01:25:47.540" style="s2">he&#39;s sharp and so taking a class with</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.659" end="01:25:49.070" style="s2">him I was like ah I have language around</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.540" end="01:25:50.449" style="s2">this there&#39;s lots of things that I have</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.070" end="01:25:51.920" style="s2">that I&#39;ve worked on in this area but</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.449" end="01:25:54.620" style="s2">there&#39;s an articulation that you have of</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.920" end="01:25:56.150" style="s2">these issues that&#39;s really right and yet</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.620" end="01:25:57.199" style="s2">I can still see there are places where</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.150" end="01:25:58.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like well you&#39;re not really getting</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.199" end="01:26:00.050" style="s2">this you know I fight and I think you</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.520" end="01:26:02.120" style="s2">could benefit from right and there was a</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.050" end="01:26:05.150" style="s2">sense of simpatico there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.120" end="01:26:07.370" style="s2">alignment so John was my mentor in that</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.150" end="01:26:10.010" style="s2">sense right and he&#39;s he&#39;s been in some</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.370" end="01:26:13.150" style="s2">sense an academic mentor and then we</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.010" end="01:26:15.469" style="s2">became collaborators so he&#39;s a peer a</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.150" end="01:26:17.389" style="s2">co-worker right we&#39;ve worked on projects</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.469" end="01:26:20.389" style="s2">together we&#39;ve operated a lab together</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.389" end="01:26:21.590" style="s2">for seven years the see wsl the</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.389" end="01:26:24.650" style="s2">consciousness of wisdom studies</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.590" end="01:26:26.120" style="s2">laboratory at U of T but more</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.650" end="01:26:28.790" style="s2">importantly than those things and</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.120" end="01:26:32.300" style="s2">informing them very deeply is that</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.790" end="01:26:34.489" style="s2">friends and in some ways because of that</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.300" end="01:26:38.360" style="s2">rich inter connection more than friends</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.489" end="01:26:38.870" style="s2">like like John is my spiritual brother</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.360" end="01:26:40.970" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.870" end="01:26:42.470" style="s2">disagree about a lot of things there are</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.970" end="01:26:44.450" style="s2">ways that he approaches things that are</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.470" end="01:26:46.550" style="s2">not how I would approach them I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.450" end="01:26:48.470" style="s2">wild child in the relationship no</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.550" end="01:26:51.650" style="s2">question and I get to believe in nine</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.470" end="01:26:53.660" style="s2">weird things but John doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.650" end="01:26:55.490" style="s2">deal with yet but gradually that I get</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.660" end="01:26:57.440" style="s2">to introduce him right which which has</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.490" end="01:26:58.760" style="s2">been one of the joys alright and and</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.440" end="01:27:01.370" style="s2">having kind of an ongoing conversation</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.760" end="01:27:02.840" style="s2">it took me years of conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.370" end="01:27:06.740" style="s2">John before I could get him to take nos</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.840" end="01:27:08.450" style="s2">nos Gnosticism seriously at all and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.740" end="01:27:09.410" style="s2">then it and now he&#39;s like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.450" end="01:27:11.810" style="s2">probably one of the world&#39;s leading</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.410" end="01:27:12.860" style="s2">experts as far as I can tell which is</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.810" end="01:27:14.270" style="s2">one of the fun things about being</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.860" end="01:27:15.710" style="s2">friends with John once you get him into</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.270" end="01:27:17.840" style="s2">something he outstrips your knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.710" end="01:27:20.150" style="s2">rapidly and I known us that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.840" end="01:27:22.760" style="s2">well but like he gets encyclopedic fast</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.150" end="01:27:24.610" style="s2">so what am I getting at what I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.760" end="01:27:27.140" style="s2">at is that there is something</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.610" end="01:27:30.170" style="s2">fundamental that goes deeper than the</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.140" end="01:27:33.110" style="s2">outer layer of the transmission of</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.170" end="01:27:37.160" style="s2">information as a scholar and even the</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.110" end="01:27:39.140" style="s2">production of knowledge within the ethos</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.160" end="01:27:41.930" style="s2">of the Academy that is just our</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.140" end="01:27:44.990" style="s2">friendship and the fact that both of us</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.930" end="01:27:46.400" style="s2">are approaching this not because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.990" end="01:27:49.700" style="s2">something that we do to pull a paycheck</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.400" end="01:27:51.380" style="s2">but because it&#39;s just like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.700" end="01:27:55.520" style="s2">like the most interesting problem in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.380" end="01:27:58.340" style="s2">world right and in the friendship the</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.520" end="01:28:00.410" style="s2">friendship is important now and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.340" end="01:28:01.970" style="s2">similarily like the conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.410" end="01:28:03.020" style="s2">you and I are having we obviously don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.970" end="01:28:04.580" style="s2">know each other very well although I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.020" end="01:28:06.800" style="s2">love to do this again and if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.580" end="01:28:11.360" style="s2">appear on my show I would be honored if</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.800" end="01:28:13.460" style="s2">you would appear on my show so yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.360" end="01:28:15.140" style="s2">know there is a sense in which and it</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.460" end="01:28:17.540" style="s2">seems like YouTube is sort of passing</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.140" end="01:28:19.610" style="s2">some kind of funny threshold in the last</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.540" end="01:28:22.490" style="s2">bunch of years where there is like a</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.610" end="01:28:24.110" style="s2">WebWork happening where communities are</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.490" end="01:28:25.550" style="s2">beginning to gel in a way that they</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.110" end="01:28:28.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t quite it&#39;s coming into its own as</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.550" end="01:28:30.200" style="s2">a medium distinct I think in a way a bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.310" end="01:28:33.500" style="s2">like the podcast to develop two distinct</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.200" end="01:28:38.000" style="s2">from radio radio was a broadcast medium</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.500" end="01:28:39.710" style="s2">right as per McLuhan but Dan Carlin of</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.000" end="01:28:41.060" style="s2">hardcore history was talking recently he</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.710" end="01:28:43.310" style="s2">was talking about the way that the</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.060" end="01:28:45.050" style="s2">podcast is intimate it whispers in your</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.310" end="01:28:46.910" style="s2">ears it&#39;s fundamentally bound up with</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.050" end="01:28:49.370" style="s2">the headphone and so it&#39;s just somebody</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.910" end="01:28:50.570" style="s2">talking gently like velvet directly in</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.370" end="01:28:52.400" style="s2">your ear is something so intimate</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.570" end="01:28:55.130" style="s2">personal but it&#39;s different than rady</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.400" end="01:28:57.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s different similarly podcasts</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.130" end="01:28:59.390" style="s2">are beginning to form this community</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.200" end="01:29:01.040" style="s2">stuff and we get we get into the</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.390" end="01:29:02.270" style="s2">personalities and lives of the people</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.040" end="01:29:06.680" style="s2">who present in a way that television</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.270" end="01:29:10.040" style="s2">never let us do right so this thing that</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.680" end="01:29:12.320" style="s2">we&#39;re doing where we where we create a</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.040" end="01:29:15.350" style="s2">language to talk about the that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.320" end="01:29:18.740" style="s2">want to talk about right and to also</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.350" end="01:29:20.600" style="s2">encounter each other&#39;s beings as people</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.740" end="01:29:22.010" style="s2">to whatever extent we are capable of</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.600" end="01:29:23.600" style="s2">authentically expressing in a limited</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.010" end="01:29:26.900" style="s2">format bla bla bla bla bla all those</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.600" end="01:29:28.580" style="s2">qualifiers this is the game this is how</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.900" end="01:29:31.070" style="s2">we do it because none of us are going to</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.580" end="01:29:32.720" style="s2">solve this alone we can only solve it</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.070" end="01:29:36.950" style="s2">collectively and the fact is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.720" end="01:29:38.810" style="s2">nobody&#39;s got the answer it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.950" end="01:29:41.780" style="s2">how it works you can&#39;t do things that</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.810" end="01:29:43.070" style="s2">way you but instead we can co-create a</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.780" end="01:29:44.990" style="s2">structure of meaning with which we can</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.070" end="01:29:46.640" style="s2">all participate so that&#39;s the practical</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.990" end="01:29:47.990" style="s2">level okay so but your question was</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.640" end="01:29:49.820" style="s2">metaphysical I just wanted to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.990" end="01:29:53.450" style="s2">I tied that off question was</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.820" end="01:29:54.980" style="s2">metaphysical so Yunus mundis so the</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.450" end="01:29:57.080" style="s2">unit&#39;s monk this is the Union term for</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.980" end="01:29:59.930" style="s2">the one world it&#39;s an old term you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.080" end="01:30:01.430" style="s2">sort of you know RiRi deploys it or</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.930" end="01:30:04.910" style="s2">appropriates it depending on your</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.430" end="01:30:08.090" style="s2">perspective and what does it mean well</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.910" end="01:30:13.190" style="s2">it means the fusion of spirit and matter</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.090" end="01:30:16.260" style="s2">or mind and matter right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.190" end="01:30:18.750" style="s2">we live in a sundered world</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.260" end="01:30:20.340" style="s2">we&#39;re philosophically speaking it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.750" end="01:30:22.970" style="s2">difficult this is the hard problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.340" end="01:30:24.750" style="s2">very difficult to conceive of how</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.970" end="01:30:28.650" style="s2">consciousness and the properties of</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.750" end="01:30:32.970" style="s2">consciousness and the mind attached to</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.650" end="01:30:35.370" style="s2">the mechanistic quantifiable measurable</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.970" end="01:30:37.650" style="s2">properties of matter it&#39;s just we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.370" end="01:30:39.960" style="s2">figure it out and people think people</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.650" end="01:30:41.220" style="s2">want to hand-wave it right which is why</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.960" end="01:30:42.870" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;ll get people to get the</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.220" end="01:30:45.000" style="s2">archaic response they&#39;re like we just</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.870" end="01:30:46.980" style="s2">have to forget about all this nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.000" end="01:30:48.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve been concerned with but I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.980" end="01:30:51.690" style="s2">there&#39;s something people mistaken about</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.300" end="01:30:53.550" style="s2">that it&#39;s like no if you understand the</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.690" end="01:30:55.440" style="s2">power of these arguments they are not</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.550" end="01:30:57.600" style="s2">just tricks that are being played there</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.440" end="01:30:59.220" style="s2">constrain was wrong right it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.600" end="01:31:03.090" style="s2">about letting the fly out of the bottle</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.220" end="01:31:06.540" style="s2">instead these are real problems now the</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.090" end="01:31:08.580" style="s2">thing is I don&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.540" end="01:31:10.500" style="s2">obviously I mean I&#39;ve done a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.580" end="01:31:13.050" style="s2">work on consciousness theory so I have</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.500" end="01:31:15.330" style="s2">some ideas right that John and I and</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.050" end="01:31:17.100" style="s2">Richard woo wrote I have some ideas</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.330" end="01:31:19.170" style="s2">about how this stuff might connect but</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.100" end="01:31:21.600" style="s2">even still I think there&#39;s a deeper rift</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.170" end="01:31:24.390" style="s2">maybe deeper than a soluble and</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.600" end="01:31:26.370" style="s2">sometimes I think to myself well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.390" end="01:31:28.320" style="s2">an epistemological limit of human beings</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.370" end="01:31:29.970" style="s2">right the smartest dog in the world</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.320" end="01:31:31.620" style="s2">won&#39;t solve this problem so maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.970" end="01:31:34.860" style="s2">smartest human won&#39;t either and</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.620" end="01:31:36.720" style="s2">sometimes I think sometimes I think no</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.860" end="01:31:39.000" style="s2">it&#39;s soluble we just have to work really</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.720" end="01:31:43.110" style="s2">hard too long and sometimes I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.000" end="01:31:45.660" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s fundamentally insoluble like</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.110" end="01:31:48.590" style="s2">maybe this is maybe there exists</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.660" end="01:31:51.240" style="s2">problems that are really actually</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.590" end="01:31:52.560" style="s2">fundamentally insoluble and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.240" end="01:31:55.200" style="s2">of them the connection a minor world</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.560" end="01:31:57.690" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a fundamental mystery I kind</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.200" end="01:32:00.450" style="s2">of deep rift with no bottom that cannot</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.690" end="01:32:01.590" style="s2">be right maybe and this is the way I</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.450" end="01:32:04.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s like maybe it&#39;s this maybe</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.590" end="01:32:08.490" style="s2">it&#39;s that what do I know</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.280" end="01:32:12.930" style="s2">so sometimes I think that sometimes I</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.490" end="01:32:15.510" style="s2">think sometimes I think that no there is</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.930" end="01:32:18.210" style="s2">a deep metaphysical truth to be pulled</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.510" end="01:32:20.070" style="s2">and and our intuition that there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.210" end="01:32:21.570" style="s2">thing which is a driving intuition and</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.070" end="01:32:24.180" style="s2">science that things should reduce down</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.570" end="01:32:26.230" style="s2">to the one say right which is an</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.180" end="01:32:27.430" style="s2">assumption maybe it doesn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.230" end="01:32:29.080" style="s2">is one of the problems in current</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.430" end="01:32:31.210" style="s2">physics we have quantum and we have</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.080" end="01:32:33.190" style="s2">relativity and we can&#39;t make them really</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.210" end="01:32:35.380" style="s2">talk to each other it&#39;s like they we</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.190" end="01:32:36.850" style="s2">won&#39;t sort it out right and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.380" end="01:32:39.070" style="s2">assumption built into that which is that</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.850" end="01:32:41.260" style="s2">it should be reducible to one consistent</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.070" end="01:32:42.970" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s an assumption it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.260" end="01:32:44.500" style="s2">assumption built in a science that our</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.970" end="01:32:47.230" style="s2">descriptions of reality should be</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.500" end="01:32:49.180" style="s2">reducible in one consistent whole with a</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.230" end="01:32:52.360" style="s2">unified factor and maybe that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.180" end="01:32:55.300" style="s2">maybe we live in a multipolar reality</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.360" end="01:32:57.670" style="s2">maybe reality isn&#39;t monotheistic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.300" end="01:33:00.280" style="s2">polytheistic and principles operate</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.670" end="01:33:02.710" style="s2">differently we don&#39;t know and who knows</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.280" end="01:33:04.210" style="s2">right it looks like there are some weird</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.710" end="01:33:05.410" style="s2">you know physical constants maybe</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.210" end="01:33:06.970" style="s2">different to different places in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.410" end="01:33:10.090" style="s2">universe that - we&#39;ll screw our</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.970" end="01:33:14.140" style="s2">conceptions of how stuff works right as</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.090" end="01:33:15.580" style="s2">a brief note on that one of the examples</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.140" end="01:33:18.100" style="s2">I use with my students all the time is</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.580" end="01:33:20.440" style="s2">like towards the end of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.100" end="01:33:22.690" style="s2">there was more or less one big remaining</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.440" end="01:33:25.360" style="s2">problem in cosmology okay it was the</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.690" end="01:33:27.610" style="s2">question is the universe gonna keep</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.360" end="01:33:29.320" style="s2">expanding forever get more slow and</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.610" end="01:33:31.690" style="s2">eventually freeze or is it going to</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.320" end="01:33:34.150" style="s2">wreak lapse into a Big Crunch right so</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.690" end="01:33:36.790" style="s2">it&#39;s like Big Bang and or Big Bang and</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.150" end="01:33:38.380" style="s2">drift and the only thing you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.790" end="01:33:40.330" style="s2">to figure that out is calculate roughly</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.380" end="01:33:44.140" style="s2">the overall total mass of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.330" end="01:33:45.760" style="s2">right and in if there&#39;s enough mass it</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.140" end="01:33:47.170" style="s2">reca lapses from gravity and if there</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.760" end="01:33:49.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t it drifts apart and gradually</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.170" end="01:33:52.900" style="s2">freezes right the so-called big freeze</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.600" end="01:33:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a Big Crunch or big freeze so</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.900" end="01:33:57.100" style="s2">finally they take a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.400" end="01:33:58.780" style="s2">detailed observations of speed that</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.100" end="01:34:00.700" style="s2">things are receding from each other in</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.780" end="01:34:03.550" style="s2">the universe right and they compile this</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.700" end="01:34:04.660" style="s2">data in the late 2000s and do you know I</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.550" end="01:34:06.700" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you tracked this stuff do</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.660" end="01:34:09.250" style="s2">you know what they find things are</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.700" end="01:34:10.140" style="s2">accelerating away from each other oh yes</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.250" end="01:34:13.150" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.140" end="01:34:16.480" style="s2">so this is dark energy which is just a</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.150" end="01:34:18.400" style="s2">fancy word for we don&#39;t know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.480" end="01:34:20.830" style="s2">accelerating so we think it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.400" end="01:34:22.600" style="s2">expand but slowed down and gradually</p>

<p begin="01:34:28.270" end="01:34:31.989" style="s2">important to remember that we have this</p>

<p begin="01:34:56.690" end="01:35:03.080" style="s2">because I mean it seems pretty obvious</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.640" end="01:35:05.060" style="s2">that my mind seems to affect the world</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.080" end="01:35:06.620" style="s2">in some way and that the world has an</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.060" end="01:35:07.340" style="s2">effect on my mind and so if it is two</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.620" end="01:35:10.120" style="s2">worlds</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.340" end="01:35:13.160" style="s2">it seems weirdly redundant hard to track</p>

<p begin="01:35:13.160" end="01:35:18.050" style="s2">idealist and I&#39;m like aha the trick is</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.920" end="01:35:19.640" style="s2">there&#39;s no material world like what do I</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.050" end="01:35:21.470" style="s2">ever experience except mental events</p>

<p begin="01:35:24.700" end="01:35:31.550" style="s2">and then the problems of idealism right</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.380" end="01:35:34.490" style="s2">and sometimes I&#39;m inclined to look at</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.550" end="01:35:39.590" style="s2">some experiences that I&#39;ve had unusual</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.490" end="01:35:42.830" style="s2">experiences that if I&#39;m in a scientific</p>

<p begin="01:35:48.680" end="01:35:52.940" style="s2">whatever to convince myself that it</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.570" end="01:35:55.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter but sometimes I think</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.940" end="01:35:57.710" style="s2">about experiences that I&#39;ve had that are</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.040" end="01:36:00.230" style="s2">weird this is what the onions refer to</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.710" end="01:36:01.700" style="s2">as synchronicity and the fact is when</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.230" end="01:36:04.940" style="s2">you start getting into this work weird</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.700" end="01:36:08.570" style="s2">things happen now what&#39;s the status of</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.940" end="01:36:10.160" style="s2">those weird things I don&#39;t know and I</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.570" end="01:36:11.950" style="s2">approach it sometimes with an eye to</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.160" end="01:36:15.140" style="s2">like maybe there&#39;s a neurobiological</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.950" end="01:36:17.810" style="s2">explanation and sometimes I&#39;m like no</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.140" end="01:36:20.660" style="s2">maybe it is what they say it is that</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.810" end="01:36:22.070" style="s2">this is a signal it&#39;s a message that</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.660" end="01:36:24.490" style="s2">your mind and the world are connected</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.070" end="01:36:29.510" style="s2">much more deeply than you think right</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.490" end="01:36:31.670" style="s2">that there and that maybe maybe it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.510" end="01:36:33.500" style="s2">the case that every story that gets told</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.670" end="01:36:35.410" style="s2">and every ounce of meaning that you</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.500" end="01:36:38.060" style="s2">bring to bear</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.410" end="01:36:39.890" style="s2">Rex and that the universe is ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.060" end="01:36:44.270" style="s2">meaningless and does not care about you</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.890" end="01:36:44.480" style="s2">maybe maybe it&#39;s more complicated than</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.270" end="01:36:47.750" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.480" end="01:36:50.030" style="s2">maybe stories do matter and at some</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.750" end="01:36:52.310" style="s2">level they do they do because they</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.030" end="01:36:54.920" style="s2">organize reality that the story of</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.310" end="01:36:56.690" style="s2">Christ has been organizing matter into</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.920" end="01:36:59.360" style="s2">churches all over the world for quite</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.690" end="01:37:00.140" style="s2">some time and a few years ago in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.360" end="01:37:02.060" style="s2">small-scale</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.140" end="01:37:03.140" style="s2">small and mystical experience I was</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.060" end="01:37:05.780" style="s2">wandering down the street and I looked</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.140" end="01:37:08.300" style="s2">at a Catholic Church and I suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.780" end="01:37:10.270" style="s2">realized that what I was looking at was</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.300" end="01:37:13.010" style="s2">the state religion of the Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.270" end="01:37:15.080" style="s2">it was an embassy of the state religion</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.010" end="01:37:17.060" style="s2">of the Roman Empire it was like it was</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.080" end="01:37:18.770" style="s2">like watching a mastodon wander out of</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.060" end="01:37:20.600" style="s2">the hedges I was like this is a leftover</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.770" end="01:37:24.260" style="s2">piece of something that&#39;s 2,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.600" end="01:37:26.030" style="s2">old right and yet the story of Christ</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.260" end="01:37:28.550" style="s2">has been faithfully operating to</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.030" end="01:37:30.290" style="s2">organize matter quite consistently did</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.550" end="01:37:31.430" style="s2">it long before I was born and it will do</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.290" end="01:37:34.400" style="s2">it long after I&#39;m dead</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.430" end="01:37:37.820" style="s2">which means well it&#39;s operating the real</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.400" end="01:37:40.310" style="s2">world right it&#39;s not actual in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.820" end="01:37:42.140" style="s2">of being material and expectable but</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.310" end="01:37:44.030" style="s2">like it&#39;s creating organized patterns</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.140" end="01:37:46.370" style="s2">what one else&#39;s reality</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.030" end="01:37:47.030" style="s2">so maybe stories have more impact than</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.370" end="01:37:48.680" style="s2">we think</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.030" end="01:37:51.020" style="s2">maybe they play a role that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.680" end="01:37:53.210" style="s2">quite getting because we&#39;re too small to</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.020" end="01:37:55.580" style="s2">see it right except insofar as we</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.210" end="01:37:57.590" style="s2">participated in and sometimes pantomime</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.580" end="01:37:59.240" style="s2">it to get something from it which is</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.590" end="01:38:01.940" style="s2">very much what we do with archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.240" end="01:38:04.370" style="s2">sometimes I think that sometimes I think</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.940" end="01:38:06.170" style="s2">you know so the answer is I try to</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.370" end="01:38:09.440" style="s2">remain radically open because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.170" end="01:38:11.420" style="s2">know and to pretend that I did know and</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.440" end="01:38:14.450" style="s2">some final sense and I&#39;ll tell you this</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.420" end="01:38:16.880" style="s2">a game I like to play it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.450" end="01:38:19.760" style="s2">perverse game but I like to get art</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.880" end="01:38:23.090" style="s2">rationalists drunk and when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.760" end="01:38:26.290" style="s2">drunk enough to ask them the weirdest</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.090" end="01:38:29.060" style="s2">thing that ever happened to them and</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.290" end="01:38:30.950" style="s2">what you get you get some funny</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.060" end="01:38:33.880" style="s2">confessions you&#39;ll get people talking</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.950" end="01:38:36.410" style="s2">about things that they would never ever</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.880" end="01:38:37.730" style="s2">talk about and then you&#39;re like so</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.410" end="01:38:39.800" style="s2">what&#39;s your explanation they&#39;re like I</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.730" end="01:38:41.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have one and it&#39;s like so what did</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.800" end="01:38:44.770" style="s2">you do about that and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.000" end="01:38:44.770" style="s2">nothing I stuck it in a drawer</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.309" end="01:38:50.030" style="s2">yeah and I think that&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.379" end="01:38:53.539" style="s2">because I&#39;m a mystic and a provocateur</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.030" end="01:38:54.019" style="s2">so but but you know so the world is</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.539" end="01:38:56.329" style="s2">weird</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.019" end="01:38:58.879" style="s2">and so the metaphysics of it the unis</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.329" end="01:39:00.530" style="s2">mundis it seems like mine didn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.879" end="01:39:02.239" style="s2">must be connected and it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.530" end="01:39:04.939" style="s2">sometimes when you get on the road of</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.239" end="01:39:08.449" style="s2">the quest that you get nudged that</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.939" end="01:39:10.879" style="s2">Mercurius winks at you across across the</p>

<p begin="01:39:10.879" end="01:39:16.159" style="s2">how does that work and it violates your</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.329" end="01:39:18.649" style="s2">sense of what the rules are you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.159" end="01:39:22.550" style="s2">limited sketchy primate sense of what</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.649" end="01:39:24.050" style="s2">reality is right hastily constructed in</p>

<p begin="01:39:24.050" end="01:39:29.899" style="s2">and so you get these winks where the</p>

<p begin="01:39:45.349" end="01:39:51.260" style="s2">a settled question but it does sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.869" end="01:39:53.209" style="s2">seem like that is sort of how it is and</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.260" end="01:39:55.340" style="s2">sometimes when you&#39;re in these mystical</p>

<p begin="01:40:11.539" end="01:40:16.459" style="s2">there right and that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>

<p begin="01:40:20.209" end="01:40:24.679" style="s2">the striking thing about it in my</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.280" end="01:40:29.059" style="s2">experience is how there&#39;s always a sense</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.679" end="01:40:30.409" style="s2">of familiarity it&#39;s not shock you know</p>
