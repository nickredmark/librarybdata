<p begin="00:01:45.040" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">and mimetics and all things not all</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:52.720" style="s2">things but several topics around</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">around that complex of of uh of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.720" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">and um but uh but to start with i will</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:00.640" style="s2">recap what i&#39;ve talked about the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">three so on the very first one</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.640" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">uh i did the very first session i did</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">the metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">and talking about how to look at things</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">instead of as</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">atomic separated objects um</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">static we should instead see them as</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">waves of patterns and we simply assign</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">names to certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:22.720" style="s2">sets of waves or wave fronts even and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">that there is a tear</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.720" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">according to the metaphysical says</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">metaphysics of quality there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:29.520" style="s2">tearing</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">or a layering of of waves of of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.520" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">characteristics and there&#39;s a physical</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">layer of biological social and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">intellectual layer</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">and every single one of these layers the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">waves and the patterns there seem to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:40.239" style="s2">push</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">whenever there&#39;s excess energy they seem</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.239" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">to push upwards uh so to speak they try</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">uh they strive for some greater order</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">that the author of the metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">quality named robert persig something</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">that he called</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">dynamic quality um so i encourage people</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">to think less about</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">atomized things billiard balls knocking</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">around in space</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">and more about everything being super</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">positional</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">uh the second stoa session i did i</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:08.159" style="s2">talked about the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">and how we should look again to the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.159" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">theme instead of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">relationships as</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">sort of a dashed or dotted line</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">connecting these</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">these billiard balls or or atomized</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">objects</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">we should instead think about inverting</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">that and see that the relational</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">stresses relationships expectations of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">and the interactions actually create</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">these locuses or loci</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">which we then give identity to uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">whether that identity is ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">whether that identity</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">is what something we might call the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:42.319" style="s2">government or france or</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">our our marriage or whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.319" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">that&#39;s to start viewing objects not in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">their hard boundaries but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:48.879" style="s2">the relationship pressures associated</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:50.159" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.879" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">and to try to view the world from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.159" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">perspective of relationships being</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:54.879" style="s2">primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">and identity being fluid and emergent</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.879" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">from all these pipes of identity</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">plugging into the same spot</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">and then the third one last time i</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">talked about a set of viewing objects</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">and relationships being static to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">instead view</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">everything as having a four-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">nature i talked about the ship of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">theseus</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">about how uh many ques so-called</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.080" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">questions and paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">of identity and philosophy are really</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">you know not a problem in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">but a problem with the the framing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">we look at things in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">and specifically if we choose to look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">things as static objects</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">um maybe imbued with something we call</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">energy or potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">that then we get very confused about</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">identity and the nature of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">but if we instead view everything as</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">being wavefronts that are always or</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">waves that are always</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">evolving in time then there isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">so many of these paradoxes and problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">uh it does then lead to other questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">like who am i what am i if i&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">bunch of overlapping wavefronts and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">expectations</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s actually a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">tangible or more attractive problem in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">my mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">so the first one is to stop looking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">the world as atomized objects but look</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">at the superpositions of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">the second is to look at relationships</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">as primary</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">and the third is to think about time</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">always think about the temporal</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">dimension not as an afterthought but as</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:08.800" style="s2">a foundational part</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:08.800" style="s2">of reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">and if we were to smoosh some of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">together we can take the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">look at the layerings of individuals or</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">objects or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">and then and actually see how all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">these proceed forward in time maybe at</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">different rates</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">and the shearing of these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">actually creates stresses and create</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">some of the problems that we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">so let me go back and recap this a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">in the physical layer in physical</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">reality we tend to think about objects</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:40.639" style="s2">as being hard demarcated things um</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">we tend to think of time as merely</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.639" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">potential right this is the big problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">with newtonian physics uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">for those who are not uh physicists on</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">this call</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.800" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">the the general problem that we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">with uh with things like newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">is that there is nothing called the or</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:05:58.479" style="s2">the arrow of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">so all the math that you write to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">describe a system of particles moving or</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">you know bouncing off each other doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">whatever you can run time forwards or</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">backwards there&#39;s no reason why they</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">have to go one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">and only with thermodynamics do we then</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">introduce something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">an arrow of time why systems must evolve</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:18.240" style="s2">so in that kind of physics time is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">really viewed as potential you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">objects they&#39;ve got mass</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a force and there&#39;s energy but</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">all of those forces and energies are all</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">potential really</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">the object is the static object and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">the relationships between them we might</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">say there&#39;s an attractive force there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">a repulsive force between these charges</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">right these are all seen as potentials</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">and the inferred by the temporal</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">coupling</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">if we were to unfreeze time and watch</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">these things evolve in time</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">we can say yes there was a force the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">force is what explains these things</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">spiraling around each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">or you know collapsing into each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.120" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">or whatever so that&#39;s a very physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">view of the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">things are demarcated and anchored in</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">a biological view of the world the layer</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">of biology</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">is when that layer of description ceases</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">to be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">the most useful we won&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">whether it&#39;s true or not true</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">we should talk about utility in</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">prediction and describing phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">and so the physical layer descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">cease to be useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">when we start having objects that can</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">have memory that seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.000" style="s2">to evolve in time and as they evolve in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">time they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">remember what happened to them in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">past and respond to that so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">what we call a path dependency</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">right you can&#39;t just say well what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">the uh future path</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">of a of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.720" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">bacterium in this petri dish right the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">physicist has no answer for you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">because it could be any number of things</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">but the biologist says well where is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">sugar</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">right well i&#39;ll tell you guess what that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">bacteria is probably gonna move in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">direction of the sugar</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">or sort of move towards the light or do</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">whatever these systems have</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">these are we tend to think about things</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">as systems of interaction they have</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">memory both of themselves and of their</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">interaction with others</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">and time now becomes a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">aspect of a biological description</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">of the world um and the cadence of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">moreover</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">the cadence of interaction between</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">things is essential so when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:10.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">a biological system like all of us are</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.319" end="00:08:13.520" style="s2">biological systems we try to analyze our</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">cellular structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.520" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">and we look at the cellular pathways and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">all of the various kind of biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:19.840" style="s2">sort of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">that happens on the order of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.840" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">milliseconds or you know microseconds</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.639" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">when we talk about us as people things</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.800" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">take on the order of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">decades right so the time scale the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">cadence of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">you have to eat and sleep on a daily</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">basis you know these are the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">things we used to talk about biological</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">systems but the key difference here</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">between biological physical</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">in my view is that in the biological</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">world we we talk about objects that have</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">memory and generally they are systems of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:47.279" style="s2">and we cannot again you can&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">memory without talking about time</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.279" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">so these have there&#39;s a strict temporal</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">aspect to or not strict but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">necessary temporal aspect to talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">um no one talks about so to make that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">just a little bit more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t talk about people as having</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">feeling a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">a hunger force driving them like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">that would be a useless description of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s not like that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">like if you feel hungry you get more</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">hungry and then you do things because</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">you get hungry</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">as you get progressively hungrier you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">know we we we sort of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">descriptions of systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">um and and the cadences and the temporal</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">evolution that way</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.880" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">and then then the next layer social</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">or the layer of social phenomena let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">say um</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:31.120" style="s2">for me the important thing there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">recursion</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.120" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">and self-awareness so at that point</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">things are</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">social in nature when they are modeling</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">the behavior of others</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">and that and also there&#39;s some awareness</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">that others are modeling us</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">that&#39;s not necessary but it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">dynamics certainly if we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">humans and other sort of uh more</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">advanced intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:52.560" style="s2">intelligent animals or creatures on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">earth um there is a concept of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.560" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">self-image</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:57.959" style="s2">um it&#39;s fascinating if you watch these</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.959" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">uncontacted tribes or under-contacted</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">tribes</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">uh when a tribe of of um</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">you know bush people let&#39;s call them</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">like that living in in like the forests</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">of papua new guinea or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:13.360" style="s2">never seen a white man before when</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:15.200" style="s2">they&#39;re first shown a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.360" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">and they see themselves it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.200" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">fascinating the discovery of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">self-image</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">um and you watch like the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:23.200" style="s2">the tribe leader</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">and then they passes around like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.200" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">kids are trying to pop in there and see</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">it&#39;s just absolutely fascinating to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">watch the human animal discover</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">uh high fidelity self-image so um</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">so this this anyway recursion</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">self-awareness is what creates</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">the social interactions or makes the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">social plane of phenomenology possible</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">and then lastly but not least of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">for this conversation today</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">or this discussion um the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">plane</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">and and i i tend to characterize that as</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">the realm of pure subjectivity or</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">intersubjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">and it&#39;s not anchored to physical</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">reality all of us are anchored to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">uh this recording will probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">hopefully maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">but this recording can absolutely um</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">have a far</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">longer life span than i ever do the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">ideas this slide deck that i</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:17.200" style="s2">that i made right in the last few days</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">the slide deck is more immortal than me</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.200" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">right so we might think wow you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">humans can become immortal by leaving a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:23.519" style="s2">legacy and you know setting up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">future generations and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.519" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">you know putting sperm and egg together</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">and all these things it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">make a powerpoint make a pdf make a meme</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">and now you&#39;ve touched immortality</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">because those things are untethered to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">physical reality in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">the human embodied life can never really</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">be at least not until we you know get</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">brain upload</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">into the matrix or whatever so um</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">another way of looking at this um of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">course our our favorite uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">uh our favorite man at the moment here</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:51.839" style="s2">is marshall mcluhan</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">who says that in an electric in an era</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.839" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">of electric communications when we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">electricity conducting ideas</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">at the speed of light um i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">guys a chance to read this</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">physical connectedness gives way to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">resonant bonds and gigantic open system</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.399" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">of electric information and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">important this last line the perception</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">of reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:16.959" style="s2">now depends upon the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">um there&#39;s a small problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">statement which we&#39;ll get to later in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">the in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">in the um presentation but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:27.360" style="s2">this is somebody in the 60s identifying</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:30.639" style="s2">that just</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.360" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">you know uh broadcast television and fm</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.639" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">radio</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">and um you know the these national</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">newspapers all of these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">are creating a reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">where the intersubjective the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">intellectual plane</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">uh actually is is dominant</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">so today communications of medics this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">all kind of sets us up then to talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:52.959" style="s2">about communications and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">that probably most people</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">would think of communications uh in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">way that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">sender there&#39;s a receiver they</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.320" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">communicate via some kind of channel</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">there&#39;s messages</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:03.839" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s feedback and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">noise in the in the channel um</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.839" end="00:13:07.120" style="s2">but the sender has an encoding the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">receiver has a decoding</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:11.519" style="s2">um this is not an unfamiliar model of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">communications if if any of us had to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.519" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">sit down and take a quiz we&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:17.519" style="s2">write something like this right</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">um but you know this is very much using</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.519" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">this object-oriented metaphysics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">very much thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">sender and receiver as as separate as</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">thinking about this message as this</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">disembodied like piece of information or</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">flowing down a wire um</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">and john perry barlow had some</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">incredibly incredible you never would</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">expected a member of the grateful dead</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">so much amazing memetic insights but he</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">is truly an amazing person</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:43.199" style="s2">and he made this observation that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:45.760" style="s2">receiving</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.199" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">information is often as creative an act</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">as generating it</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">we often we should assign a value to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">information based on its meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:54.639" style="s2">which of course is defined within the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.639" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">the subjectivity of the receiver</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">so this is really really a a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">very different way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">because when you look at this picture of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:07.920" style="s2">communications</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">we tend to think about well the sender</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.920" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">has an idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">they got a message to send they put the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">message in the bottle they float the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:15.519" style="s2">bottle</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">to the other person and they did all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.519" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">stuff the other person just has to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">you know catch the bottle pop it open</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">you know find some light</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">and then like read the faded text and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">that&#39;s all they got to do right and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">sending of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">messages is like where all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">happens right authorship of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">authorship is is emphasized and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">glamorized</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">readership no one thinks about the act</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">of reading and the act of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">when you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">as being equal to that task and yet what</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">john perry barlow is saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">is that no actually reading</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">interpretation is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">as creative and act as generating the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">thing in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">maybe when we think about music this</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">becomes a little more accessible right</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">all of us know that to really enjoy i</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">mean everyone&#39;s got probably some pieces</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">of music they really enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">and and you know it&#39;s that to you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">the feeling of really listening to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">piece of music and really enjoying it</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">is different than just having a blasting</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">on the car when you&#39;re like driving</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">when you really sit there and and feel</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">the music</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">or when you&#39;re if you if you go to um</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">music concert or if you go to rave</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">or you go and you dance to music right</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an expression</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:21.680" style="s2">receiving music but also transmitting at</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">the same time and acting at the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.680" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">time so</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">this this idea that receiving</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">information is a creative act it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">not so foreign to us but most people i</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">would venture don&#39;t think about it in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">that the act of reception is is such an</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.199" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">um active thing and um</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">and so the the the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">that comes the meaning making between</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:46.399" style="s2">the sender and the receiver in this act</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">of communication</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.399" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">that actually comes from the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">when nowadays with with uh so much</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">broadcast media um</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">we are so used to the idea of receiving</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">information as the thing we do</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">disembodied</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">from the transmission like someone</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">performed it somebody taped it somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">edited it somebody added a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">other crap to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">and then having been preaching</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">pre-digested it&#39;s blasted out over</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.800" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">airwaves and over fiber into our brains</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">into our eyeballs into our ears</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">and so um the act of reception</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">now is the is is really like we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">choose to receive it or interpret it</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:25.199" style="s2">but but that&#39;s really where we get to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">make our meaning we can&#39;t go back like i</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.199" end="00:16:28.240" style="s2">can&#39;t go and talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.240" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">back to any of those people in fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.240" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">twitter&#39;s whole little</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">twitter&#39;s cool little social hack is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">give people the semblance of being able</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">to do so</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">right like barack obama tweets something</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">or donald trump tweets something</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">and then thousands of people tweet</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">responses to him</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:46.160" style="s2">why he&#39;s not gonna read it right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.160" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">theater it&#39;s you&#39;re stabbing a voodoo</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:49.680" style="s2">doll hoping that you&#39;re gonna talk to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.680" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">no you got a voodoo doll and the entire</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">act the entire</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">um uh performance there is to get you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">engaged in listening to what the voodoo</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">doll has to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">not because the voodoo doll feels the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">pain or the the transmitter of it has</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">anything to do with you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">so we now in this electric well almost a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:12.720" style="s2">post-electric age at this point in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">in the um internet age we we are uh very</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">confused and upside down on this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">right if you think about communication</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">originally started a tribal sense around</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">a campfire people talking back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">to each other</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">uh very point to point and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">tribal and then it became this mass</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">dissemination</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">uh and we&#39;re now just on the receiving</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">end of it so we&#39;re we&#39;re conditioned to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:31.919" style="s2">be receivers</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">just like with products you know so many</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">uniform products</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:38.160" style="s2">vended to us by the um industrial system</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:38.880" style="s2">that terminates at walmarts and costco&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.160" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.880" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">we are trained to be consumers of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">pre-fabricated pre-chew pre-digested</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">we are not we&#39;re not really set up or</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:51.919" style="s2">encouraged to see ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">interactors with artisans um who go who</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.919" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">work with artisans to define the bespoke</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">thing we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">so same thing with meaning making and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">communication um</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">and so my contention is that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">users tools to establish agency in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">reception process this is one of my</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">biggest beefs of social media</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">is that it&#39;s it&#39;s a walled garden of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">communications infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">terminates</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">in software and uis that are controlled</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">by a very tiny few</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">number of people facebook tells me what</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">things i get to see in my feed</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">twitter defines exactly how i see pieces</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">of content not just the order of things</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">in the feed</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:30.080" style="s2">but how i even see the content that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:32.000" style="s2">quote retweets are not shown in line</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">that i see the number of likes and down</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.000" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">votes and whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">and like i&#39;m exposed to content before i</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">get to choose who it is i want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:41.039" style="s2">all of the millions of decisions around</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">the user interface</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.039" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">i have no choice in them i am basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:46.000" style="s2">being force fed my eyeball like</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">clockwork orange style my eyeballs</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.000" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">propped open</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:50.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m given exactly this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">interaction mode</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.000" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">so the ability to do meaning making is</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:55.840" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">relegated to just in my brain my control</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.840" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">over attention</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">managing my own internal emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">psychic energy and balance</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">while i&#39;m sort of getting force-fed this</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">stuff in this manner right</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">so um the other piece of this then is if</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">any medium facilitates interaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">it has a very important and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">subtle influence on the act of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">um the fact that twitter by default</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">allows makes all</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.640" style="s2">accounts public and anyone can reply not</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">just people that follow you and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">followers of followers right</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">the idea of a follower versus a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">subscriber versus a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">these are all things just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">software artifacts they&#39;re like sql</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">queries inside or i guess only sql but</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">they&#39;re queries inside the twitter</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">software and yet that completely defines</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">the landscape interaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">right these kinds of things in instagram</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">and facebook uh in snapchat</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">they get kids they facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">cyberbullying they create a medical</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">landscape that slides towards</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">uh towards anger and towards meanness</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">towards um</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">hostility and outrage so if we create</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">software if we create mediums if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">create socialization environments um</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">anything that we do that creates an</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">interaction for</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">um or creates a facility for interaction</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">um we actually are</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.440" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">deeply influencing the act of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">making and that&#39;s that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">that&#39;s something to be taken that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">task to be taken not lightly</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">um and then lastly of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually seeing is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">critical element that&#39;s that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">overlooked in the um</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">in this effort to turn information into</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">a commodity this is this this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">a lot of words but what what john perry</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">barlow is saying there</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">is that when we take information if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">zoom out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">and we&#39;ll slow down just one one second</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">here if we zoom out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">and again think about communication not</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">as being a sender doing a bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">to create a disembodied artifact called</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">uh a communication</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">or information and then they&#39;re pumping</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">it down a channel to a receiver</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">okay if we view things from that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">we can&#39;t help but view information as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">disembodied artifact and the receiver as</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">being an</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">active passive receiver of crap if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">actually view communications as</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">necessarily an interaction</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">then we realize that so many of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">communications infrastructures today</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.919" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">are like factory farms force-feeding a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">bunch of pigs</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:17.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually facilitating meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">making and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.440" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">so if we look at the world through the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">lens of senders creating content piping</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">out to receivers</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">then we necessarily overlook the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">importance of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">the receiver having time space context</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">and opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">to make sense to understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i mean this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:40.559" style="s2">this is a little cherry on top of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">sense maker in residence why sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.559" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">making is a term you know sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">geeky term so many of us are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">use more more we&#39;d want to get it</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">popularized</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">in the vernacular because it is it is um</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">you are not consumers you are not</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:57.520" style="s2">recipients of content</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">you are sense makers desperately</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.520" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">aching and hungering for interaction</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">mediums</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">in which you can do better sense making</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">and those interaction mediums</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">must necessarily for their if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">they&#39;re good at doing that if they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">they are if they support you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.919" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">having good sense making then they will</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">necessarily strive to put you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">in uh i guess what jordan likes to call</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">right relationship with other humans and</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">sense makers and together</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">then you can have a collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">intelligence otherwise you&#39;re just</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">and of course you&#39;re not gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">chance to make sense of the world of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">course you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">have understanding because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">what the force-feeding pipe is</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">right it&#39;s homogenized product</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">disseminated to a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">and hopefully it tastes like food you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">know that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">the the embed in this last sentence</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what i read in it and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">barlow wrote this decades ago decades</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">ago guys just absolutely genius</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">but um the other thing that i would say</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">tying to this this is not something he</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">said was something that i say</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">is that real information is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">non-rivalrous</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">real information is generative real</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:09.360" style="s2">information if we call it information</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s an act of sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.360" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">that is generative it is not scarce</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">ironically</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">bandwidth and attention are scarce right</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">there&#39;s only even if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">thick bundle of fiber like this going</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">under the sea</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">there&#39;s still finite bandwidth to it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">your attention every single person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:29.280" style="s2">attention is scarce</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">but if we actually create information</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.280" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">if we actually make goods do good sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">making with each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">that is an anti-rival risk uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:39.679" style="s2">anti-scarce</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">thing so another</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.679" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">way i would like to um oh there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:47.279" style="s2">empty bullet point there</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">let me take one sip of tea</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.279" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">before launching the next point which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">um another way to think about this</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">um this concept that the receiver</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">is um not just a passive receiver the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:02.240" style="s2">communication is not just the simple</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">model of a tube you know and uh and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.240" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">receiver and a transmitter</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">um the medium itself is a is an</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:12.159" style="s2">important part</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">of the communications um making</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.159" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">communications possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">and i would just pose this question for</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">you a little thought experiment in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">morning here</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">which one of these things is transparent</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">which one of these things is opaque</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">not a hard question but many of you may</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:31.760" style="s2">suspect a trick question right</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">because the brick wall is clearly opaque</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.760" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">and then the and a glass window is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">clearly transparent</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:39.279" style="s2">and so we use terms like transparency or</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">opacity</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.279" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">as properties of the medium right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.600" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">this is you know and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s we when we talk about oh um</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">you know the leadership of this company</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">is being transparent</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">or we want a transparent political</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">process we use that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">as an attribute as almost an objective</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">attribute</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">a physical attribute of the thing itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">but the thing that&#39;s lost in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">is that transparency is entirely a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">property of the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:09.600" style="s2">receiving apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">and the signal so the brick wall is</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.600" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">actually quite transparent to radio</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">frequencies</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">you can stand inside a brick house with</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">a with an fm receiver and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">radio all day long</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">right your cell phone works through</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">brick because if it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s a little bit attenuated but</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">not like if you were on the side of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">copper wall</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">right so um transparency</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">right this is this is just a simple</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">statement and then you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">okay peter if you&#39;re so clever what</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">about glass</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">well glass is transparent to us glasses</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">of course transparent to radio waves</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">but if you&#39;re looking at things in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">infrared i may heat that glass up to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">you know 150 degrees fahrenheit and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">an infrared camera on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">sees just a sheet of red</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing or a sheet of blue or</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">sheet like it&#39;s just completely opaque</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">and you can have two people five people</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">on the other side of that wall or on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">other side the glass</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">and the infrared camera would not be</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">able to see anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">because by heating the glass up to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">certain temperature the infrared camera</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">now human body temperatures are below</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">the the thermal threshold or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">below the noise floor so yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">make glass</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">opaque as well it&#39;s opaque to infrared</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">and actually had a cop uh who was</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">talking to me about this where they</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">have like they wanted to be able to use</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">like night vision equipment</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">and more and more of the modern night</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">vision equipment is uh thermal imaging</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">and the problem is when you use a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">thermal imaging night vision thing from</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">inside a cop car</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">the glass is completely opaque because</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">your body heat of the car makes the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:37.760" style="s2">glass</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:38.799" style="s2">opaque and so i was showing him a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.760" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">different kind of night vision device</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.799" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">that i had</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">which can see what you see through it so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">um even our intuitions are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">stuff right it it</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">serves to confound the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">transmission</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">of communications and so um the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:55.600" style="s2">thing to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">why why brick walls and glass what does</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">that do with anything well</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">what this has to do with is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">everything is both a medium and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">transmitter</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:04.080" style="s2">you and i are of course all transmitters</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">i&#39;m doing more of the transmitting in</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">this call so far</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:11.200" style="s2">but um but we&#39;re also mediums we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">memory loaded cells that bounce around</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:13.440" style="s2">and resonate with messages and then send</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">them off</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">like we&#39;re all like little dangling</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:18.399" style="s2">church bells right</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">thousands millions of church bells and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">when one rings it causes rings and all</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">of the others as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">uh with a little bit of lag so this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">this is the thing to understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">that everything is medium and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">transmitter and when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">opacity</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">transmis uh transparency we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">looking at it kind of 90 degrees off or</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">45 degrees off we need to tilt our</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">into conductivity and susceptibility to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">re-transmit</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">um and yeah i said memory is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">phenomena of a medium now all of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">sudden taking on a four dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">and so this is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">because if you can view media mediums</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">as having a temporal extent you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">even an impulse thing something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">only happens once</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">the memory of it because the medium has</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:06.159" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">it actually turns it into a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.159" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">kind of object it turns it into almost a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">biological object because it has</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">because the medium itself has that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">nature of of of shearing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">across time smoothing it over time and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">integrating over time</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">so the other thing that happens of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">course is that all</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.799" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">media really it changes as we pass</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">messages through it</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">it changes as it supports and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">facilitates interaction</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">and of course it warps the message that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">it conducts there&#39;s always degradation</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">and transmutation</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">um and nowadays especially with social</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">media and with</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:40.880" style="s2">so many of our online communications</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:44.159" style="s2">being conducted through</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.880" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">applications and software that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.159" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">um that that are so like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">actually communications media right</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">they just give the illusion of being</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.559" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">communications media and it&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">happy accident they do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">they&#39;re really designed to be attention</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">hijacking systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">that modify and modulate our thinking um</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">and run faster ooda loops around our</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:06.320" style="s2">so um but but even even if we use</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">something more like less sinister like</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.320" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">email</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">right um even the medium of email</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">changes the messages that are conducted</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">it we have to linearize things we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">to put things into the format and then a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">lot of context is lost</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">you know so so as these things transmit</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">any kind of medium as it transmits</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">messages um the medium itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">transforms what is what is intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">uh within it</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">so i i take a pause there and say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">a number of different directions we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">go here we won&#39;t have time to cover all</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">but if people have questions or comments</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">for me to drill in on each of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">or some of these i can i can do so</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">yeah um so start throwing your questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:51.450" style="s2">in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">i&#39;ll warm peter up with one um</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">you know the meme that people are</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">yes the meaning crisis um</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">the meaning crisis is complex because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">comes from a number</p>

<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">one of them is uh is economic in nature</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">from the act of use or consumption</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">and this is not something mcluhan talked</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">about but this is something a related</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:54.399" style="s2">that um a guy named gilbert simondon</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">wrote a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.399" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">um so the fact that our work is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:01.039" style="s2">separated from</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">the impact of the work um so often</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.039" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">like uh nowadays that&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">big part of the meaning crisis i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">another part of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">however is directly tied to this which</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">um we we all each of us have a fine</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">amount of attention every day</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">and and more and more that attention is</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">coupled into systems</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">that are hierarchical broadcast kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">in nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">and they um do not encourage us to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">engage</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">in um in sort of convivial</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.720" style="s2">and deeply uh rich interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">so uh ironically of course i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">broadcasting to all of you here in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">thing but</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">but forgive me for that but um but i</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">think that is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">that i think is a big part of it as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s shocking if you think um</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know how to speak to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">know the really much younger people</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">but anyone you know kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">generation or maybe maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">younger and certainly any older</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">um before the smartphone which remember</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:07.039" style="s2">was only 2007 time frame</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">what did we do all day like we actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.039" end="00:32:09.919" style="s2">just looked at stuff and thought about</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:10.640" style="s2">stuff we&#39;d read books we talked to each</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.919" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.640" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">if we sat around a room by ourselves all</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">the time uh we get kind of bored we</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">don&#39;t seek other people out hey what are</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">you doing let me follow along let me</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">talk a little hey you want to play some</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:21.840" style="s2">cards</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:23.679" style="s2">let&#39;s or probably end up happening is we</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.840" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">flip on the tv and sit and watch tv</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.679" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">together but at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">we would be together observing a thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:31.679" style="s2">a way to build trust and meaning uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">mutual appreciation of our observation</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.679" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">of a thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">um you know movie night ever watching</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">movie together at least we all did it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">together now movie night is everyone on</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">the on screen</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">uh completely atomized from everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">else in each each getting our own bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">and slice of the giant</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">um pile of content right so meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">comes a lot of the meaning for humans</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:50.880" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">uh interactions with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">living in embodied life our interaction</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">with the environment and the greater</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">so much of our technology has been</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">carving that away and giving us narrow</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2">cast and also a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">um filtered lens on reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">and ultimately meaning suffers so</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">yeah great uh so we&#39;ve got tons of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">questions in the chat i gotta have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.840" end="00:33:16.640" style="s2">circle back to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">terror information uh or information</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.640" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">terror complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s intriguing me but um uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">anjon if you can uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.000" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">read your question to peter</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">hey peter um i was just wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">could give more examples</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">um for this set of mental models how you</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">kind of apply them</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">for this set of mental models how i</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">apply them um</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">yes so</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">for instance you know right now there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">a um a lot of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">um after the movie the social dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">came out there&#39;s now you know a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">twitter and sort of stirred up some</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">conversation around um</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">um uh fault and around harm</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">around these platforms and are they bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">are they good</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">um you know this and that and the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">and uh and i i read</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">i can i can get about halfway through</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">any of those kinds of threads because by</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">by halfway through</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">i feel like just like throwing a brick</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">through my monitor because people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">starting</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">on this problem from such a broken</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">metaphysical frame</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">um and it&#39;s like if you were to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">transported back to the 1400s</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">and you&#39;ll walk around and see people</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">are arguing about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:26.639" style="s2">which kind of leeches are the best to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">bleed people out</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.639" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">when they have i don&#39;t know a common</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">cold right and you&#39;re like no</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">probably like stop defecating in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">street that might be a good start right</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">um and you just feel like tearing your</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">your your your hair out</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:40.320" style="s2">because people are coming at this from</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">the wrong frame</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.320" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">so one material way that this influences</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">my thinking is understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">the thing we have to fix is kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">you know mcluhan s</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">sort of thing uh or this john perry</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">barlow thing we have to fix the medium</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">of interaction itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not about putting more fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">checkers on facebook or</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.960" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">regulating the crap out of cda230</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">although we do need to put some tweaks</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">on cda230</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">there&#39;s um it&#39;s it&#39;s really about</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">the the if the problem see with this</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.720" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">frame you can see the problem is in</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">a hierarchical system of messaging</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">as an important act that takes that</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">so tied to that answer then i&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">about um this one thing here twitter</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">and facebook as a shout box so it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">from this frame</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">that i um came up with a a metaphor for</p>

<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">um which is uh and i&#39;ll share with you</p>

<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">audience of a few hundred people right i</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">have about um</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">28 000 followers on twitter i&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">ever been in a room with about 3 000</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">right and getting up in stage in front</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">of a few thousand people like i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">cool with that because i&#39;m pretty used</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">to public speaking now</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">for most people it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">nerve-wracking experience and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">it was for me the first time i did it</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:17.359" style="s2">but getting on stage in front of 10 10</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">000 28 000 people i would never do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.359" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">but do i think twice we&#39;re tweeting</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">someone say no i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">right and so the shout box is one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:28.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a way to look at the the this</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.240" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">instead of looking at is just a tweak on</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.240" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">you know an internet tweak on broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">television</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">viewing it as a harm or as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:38.000" style="s2">engineering harmful engineering for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">memetic environment</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.000" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a way i can look at it when i</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">view um communication not in this model</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">but more in the mcluhan or the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">barlow sense of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">and the harm then is articulated as</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not giving people agency they</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">cannot tweak the dials on their</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">facebook and twitter earmuffs they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the app the app is what the app is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">right facebook shut down all of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">different apps that were kind of playing</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">with their graph api and things like</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">that would offer an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">experience to the facebook system they</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.720" end="00:39:07.359" style="s2">shut that down you know 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">so anyway these this one concrete</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.359" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">of how i applied this model in my</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">thinking and my critique of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">social media technology</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">all right um andy you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.040" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">just turned myself off mute so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.640" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">thinking metacognitively peter about</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">this whole process of kind of a 30</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:40.560" style="s2">is uh um supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">i guess in an ideal world if it was a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.560" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">dance or jazz improvisation</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">it would be back and forth where the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">receivers give</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">some kind of feedback in real time</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">to the lecturer and then the lecturer</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:57.760" style="s2">can adjust accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">the content uh do you have some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">about how we could make</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">this process um</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:05.839" style="s2">ether technology or some other creative</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.839" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">um more interactive without</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">interruption where you&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">vibe from the receivers</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s a little um that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">i mean a lot of this is my own fault</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">right i could have come in here and just</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">had a conversation with different people</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">and just kind of rotate through everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">calling everyone and we all just have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.920" style="s2">you know we have a multiple of 30x</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">one-on-one right and everyone gets some</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">value from that that&#39;ll be a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:39.760" style="s2">mode and feel than me coming here taking</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">half the time</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.760" end="00:40:45.040" style="s2">with uh with a you know a slide deck um</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">but i felt like presenting some of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">was part of like the the best way for me</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">to do some level set or context setting</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:53.680" style="s2">um and then and it&#39;s so it&#39;s a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a balance</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.680" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">um uh i think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">if people um the question you ask is</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">actually the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">the most important question um with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">tools and technology</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">we have how can we create modes of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">that uh are that that best</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">surface collective intelligence that get</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">the best questions out</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">that then create the most the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">insight for the most people etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">and then um that that interrupt viewing</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:28.079" style="s2">that is an interactive process</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">um you know that is something i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.079" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">know there&#39;s a perfect thing out there</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:31.839" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">i do think but but just consider if</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.839" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">there were no chats at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">if there was no chat and people had to</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:38.480" style="s2">raise their hand</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">and then one person let&#39;s say it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.480" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">peter or somebody else had to go and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">pick and call on people</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">um that&#39;s the way that a normal lecture</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">happens that&#39;s the way that talks at</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">conferences go right</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">way worse way worse and what i&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">seen in the chat here</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">is that as people start raising</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">questions or asking questions or making</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">additional points</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">other people start kind of an ad hoc</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">fashion talking to them</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">now unfortunately with zoom the chat is</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">not threaded</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">and discord also is not threaded i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">slack is threaded right</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:10.880" style="s2">but you can imagine not too far in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">future a system where we could have</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.880" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">these interactive dialogues and then the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">threaded conversations could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:17.760" style="s2">tied to certain time points in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">recording</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.760" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">and anyone going back in time could</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:23.040" style="s2">watch as they watch recording</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">the particular parts of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.040" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">could actually scroll through</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">alongside the recording so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:29.200" style="s2">what the audience had to say to decorate</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:32.960" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">right um and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.960" end="00:42:36.000" style="s2">to the point about memory being an</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">important part</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.000" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">the medium has memory the memory can</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:40.800" style="s2">influence the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">communication itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.800" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">at that point being there live for this</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">event is almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">ancillary it&#39;s because you can always</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">come afterwards and see</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">the text and then add another comment</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">and then we can have a conf i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">would still be able to be tagged right</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">and i&#39;d have to be able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:55.440" style="s2">conversation and this would be a much</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">richer</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.440" end="00:42:58.800" style="s2">sort of thing especially if those things</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.800" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">easily link to nodes and notion or roam</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.760" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">you just build this like actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">sense-making uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">technology web that will be really rich</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:10.880" style="s2">and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">um you know there&#39;s it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">solve the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">the fundamental live interaction</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">bandwidth problem um because humans just</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">understand language at a certain rate</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">um and there&#39;s there&#39;s a trade-off to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">like having a small group of five or six</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">people who can each get equal airtime</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">to getting to amplifying you know having</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:29.280" style="s2">many people be able to get in real time</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">but but even even then we see that</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">there&#39;s panel discussions with audiences</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">that can participate right</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">so those are also ways to to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">expand the medium i think any point</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">any way you choose to do live kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">things like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">it&#39;s always a trade-off um but i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:48.400" style="s2">tying it to both memory and tying it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">a higher um more featureful kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">textual mechanism to tie in everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:53.440" style="s2">else&#39;s brains</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">who are part of the thing that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.440" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">ultimately is going to crew you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">cause this thing to be much more</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">all right danny you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">it was about um what was it about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">here we go now yeah i mean there you go</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">i have for years been haunted</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:29.280" style="s2">by how much i want to share</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:32.079" style="s2">information i hear it and it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.280" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">thrust it&#39;s like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.079" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">enough for me to know it i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:38.319" style="s2">sharing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">yes yeah and that&#39;s getting accelerated</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.319" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">right and then the other side of it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:45.599" style="s2">i&#39;m getting deluged by</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">all the sharing that&#39;s happening and i</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.599" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:51.760" style="s2">if i saw some place in one of your talks</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">where you said some you said</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.760" end="00:44:56.079" style="s2">sharing is knowledge or something like</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">did you make a connection between</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">sharing and knowledge i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">anyway i i just want to know what your</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">how do you feel because certainly it</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">work it&#39;s all about twitter and</p>

<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">oh yeah um i think sharing i mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">it was in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2">session on um well three was temporal</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:24.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">two was relational right and would have</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">had to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:33.040" style="s2">in relational that i would have said um</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">yeah dynamic relationships and then the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.040" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">uh all right yeah i couldn&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">again it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:41.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a piece of this that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">meaning making but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.119" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">about it that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">broadcasting right when i share i&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">of broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">well you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">um and and i think uh let me open up</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">but maybe um i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">maybe on the section on privacy</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">here or</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">here no well i mean i guess the thing i</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">sharing is not the same as broadcast and</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">um a little bit to peter&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:33.520" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">the the meaning crisis we are all</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.520" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">enrolled in unfortunately a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">the uh viral fame lottery in celebrity</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">that gives us um uh maybe gives us a bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">of serendipitous connection with other</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">people who may be</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">of similar values to us like oh i like</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">i like kim kardashian you like him good</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">as you maybe have something in common we</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">can go actually have a convivial</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">relationship together and be</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">friends but probably not right because</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">that&#39;s not the point of kim kardashian</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:26.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not the point of celebrities and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">celebrity images</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.640" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">and celebrity culture the point of it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">to move product schlep a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">product and create</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">a neurotic desire to consume so when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:38.160" style="s2">think about sharing</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">i want to go back to the more primal</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">almost shamanistic</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">view of sharing which is sharing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">sharing is is giving sharing is loving</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:48.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">if it&#39;s a sharing that&#39;s not rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.400" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">loving if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:53.359" style="s2">there there to love if there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">there to put that into</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.359" end="00:48:58.480" style="s2">then then then the sharing is your shot</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">you&#39;re throwing a dart at the celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.480" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">dartboard</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s just kind of what it</p>

<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">um and all of us can live life that way</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">all of us can choose to stop</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:35.599" style="s2">and not and just kind of get off the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">train of wanting to have viral explosion</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.599" end="00:49:38.000" style="s2">and just say</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna have a meaningful interaction</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.000" end="00:49:41.359" style="s2">with this person today and no one else</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">in the world will ever know about it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.359" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">just doing this</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">but this is meaningful to me and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:47.760" style="s2">meaningful to them and</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">in that and that&#39;s the thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.760" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">would say that that&#39;s really been taken</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:53.440" style="s2">away from us</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:54.960" style="s2">is the notion that we have agency</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">and we we have the ability to make our</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">own meaning we don&#39;t have to just</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">do it by signing up for something we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">make meaning with other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">all day long every day it&#39;s just on us</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">and and and danny to your thing about</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:11.119" style="s2">wanting to share</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:12.240" style="s2">i think you&#39;ll find just as as uh the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.119" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">great um</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.240" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">um oh my god uh tom lehrer said life is</p>

<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:22.559" style="s2">what you put into it</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">so if you if you put into uh those that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:26.480" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">not a not a desire to have things go</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">but out of a like an authentic genuine</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">desire to participate in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">you&#39;ll find probably a lot of haters a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">lot of people ignore you but then a few</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">people connect and you just work those</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">great deal of meaning and pleasure out</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:45.160" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s that that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">when jordan talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.160" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">self-organizing collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">uh the reason why jordan like is so</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">so fascinated with q anon as a thing is</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">that there is a pu</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">not necessarily their ideas but q anon</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:50:59.839" style="s2">is a phenomenon let&#39;s be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">um there is a very interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.839" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">how networked it is it&#39;s like the web</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.559" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">rings of 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">when people made websites and they found</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">a few other people who are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">babylon 5 are really into anime</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:12.079" style="s2">and they connected with them that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">meaningful that was a meaningful web</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a great web for facebook to go</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">make trillions of dollars on but it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">a meaningful web for human</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">collective kind of collective network</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know if that answers your</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">question but that was just you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">speaking to the point i guess about</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">yeah let me um let me reflect one thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">to pause for me to pause why am i</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">where is it coming from</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">and then this the last thing you said</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:44.079" style="s2">and i would even say just a meaning</p>

<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:47.920" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">web if that&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">yes yes yeah and and the thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.280" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">of course if you try to do it by</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">yourself in the middle of the shout box</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:02.319" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re going to be drowned out so</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">you need to find places</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">and be adjacent to places and people and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:07.599" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">where you&#39;re more likely to find people</p>

<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:14.240" style="s2">right we need to surf into the little</p>

<p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">of serendipitous connection and from</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">there create</p>

<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s kind of how we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.040" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">cultivate this uh i&#39;m personally</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">invested in some technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">to create better infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:31.920" style="s2">gets us to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">getting serendipity and modern web kinds</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.920" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">of things but away and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">outside of the shoutbox monetization</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">and i think those kinds of things will</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">uh dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">improve uh the ability of people like</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:50.000" style="s2">that is generative as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:50.720" style="s2">having it all washed away by the</p>

<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">oh which one um whatever one feels alive</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.559" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">i like the topic and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve been diving hacking into but</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">a lot of times the mental models</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.160" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">it i have to attract the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:27.359" style="s2">the audience sometimes they have to give</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:29.040" style="s2">the audience where they are yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.359" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">maybe one of the muscles i&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.040" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">doing zoom is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:35.040" style="s2">i find zoom uh talking to the void</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">there&#39;s an emptiness of just this</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.040" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">platform just</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s crap because it&#39;s just this tasting</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">and timing of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just a non-human so</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">uh one aspect is a question of building</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">this muscle</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">tracking the flow of the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">just the pace of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">communication flow and then is there</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">a mechanism of uh facilitating better so</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:03.440" style="s2">you have curators editors</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">filters who can help process all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.440" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">shouting to say</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:08.000" style="s2">this is what five of the shelters are</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">saying or this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.000" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">this is just noise over here someone who</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:14.079" style="s2">some level of intelligence instead of ai</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.079" end="00:54:17.119" style="s2">which is just advertising</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.079" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">let&#39;s say and then also digital media</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:19.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a framing of analog versus</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:22.000" style="s2">digital</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.760" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">so digital allows you to compress time</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:24.720" style="s2">you just take out all the excess but</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:27.839" style="s2">then that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.720" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">human you&#39;re processing too much digital</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.839" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">versus human analog take whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:35.280" style="s2">want that response</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">um so i think there&#39;s oh yeah so number</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.280" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">um you you can actually i was gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">you could use some</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:43.839" style="s2">modern machine learning kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:46.960" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">um condensation of a lot of textual</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:49.839" style="s2">feedback</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">and then maybe like you know kind of net</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.839" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">that out and try to like</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:54:55.359" style="s2">give the uh the speaker sort of like top</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:57.200" style="s2">level things like here are the things</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.359" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">that people liked and what you said like</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">uh a dream system if one were to dream</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:03.520" style="s2">is one that captures my</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">my speech and transcribes it in real</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">time and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">it looks at that looks what people are</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">speaking to responding to and then it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">some i don&#39;t know gpt three-ish kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:14.480" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">to go and net out okay here&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">what people are responding to this last</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:19.920" style="s2">two slides you just presented right</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">here&#39;s a couple of the the more popular</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.920" end="00:55:23.680" style="s2">questions that people had</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:24.960" style="s2">that would that you can absolutely build</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.680" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.960" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">you know with what we have today you</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">could sort of build some something kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">of like that i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:33.119" style="s2">uh although it would take some tweaking</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">um but something like that in the future</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:35.520" style="s2">could be very useful</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.319" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">for doing this compression and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:41.920" style="s2">integration right of of a broad</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">number of people when we&#39;re speaking in</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.920" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">zoom there is definitely a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:51.119" style="s2">um we are speaking into the void</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">what one thing that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.119" end="00:55:55.359" style="s2">i would i would i would be curious</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">what different speakers views are when</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.359" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">they&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">so i tend to prefer to have a gallery</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:04.319" style="s2">so that i can see um what i&#39;m doing when</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">i&#39;m doing meetings with like my</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.319" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">my senior executives or whatever i</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">provide gallery mode because then i can</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">see everyone i can see kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">people&#39;s resp expressions and i&#39;m sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:12.960" style="s2">of looking at that just like if we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:14.640" style="s2">a small room together</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.960" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">when it starts to get to quite a large</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.640" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">number of people though uh when i do</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">like um you know conference keynote or</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.400" style="s2">whatever like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:25.520" style="s2">i switch to um speaker view</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.400" end="00:56:28.640" style="s2">so i&#39;m actually just seeing myself and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">um and that may seem really weird but</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.640" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s almost like my brain</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">fragments into two</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s a part of me that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">like a qa supervisor</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">that&#39;s looking at how i&#39;m showing up and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:40.319" style="s2">trying to play based on what i know the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.680" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.319" end="00:56:43.520" style="s2">or what i think of the audience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.319" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">trying to play back how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.520" end="00:56:45.599" style="s2">receiving</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">my thing so i&#39;m doing real-time</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.599" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">modulation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:50.960" style="s2">of my um of my speech of how i show up</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">of my</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.960" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">my cadence and things like that uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">not an intel it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:58.880" style="s2">a a a conscious process even it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">it actually makes me feel very</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">comfortable to be talking to my own</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">image i don&#39;t know what that says of me</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">but but i i like it because then</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">well it&#39;s like a studio monitor right</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:08.400" style="s2">when you&#39;re singing you want to have the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">monitor so you can hear yourself</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.400" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s that kind of thing um but</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:14.079" style="s2">you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">i mean when you do a zoom presentation</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.079" end="00:57:17.359" style="s2">it&#39;s you&#39;re speaking to the void</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">and and that&#39;s so different than being</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.359" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">an audience of real people because you</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.200" end="00:57:22.480" style="s2">get the energy of people people nodding</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">people you just look around everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.480" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">checking their phones or people holding</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:25.680" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">my favorite when i give technical talks</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.680" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">when people hold up their cell phones</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">take pictures of my slides</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:31.680" style="s2">that&#39;s great um so so you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.640" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">reading the real-time</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.680" end="00:57:35.839" style="s2">dynamics of the room and the whole body</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">the embodied experience of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.839" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">is very different because you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">you&#39;re actually in this room of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re in a connected web even if</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">they&#39;re not saying a single word</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.960" end="00:57:46.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s your point about analog</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">versus digital um now i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.880" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">the word analog versus digital is the is</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:53.280" style="s2">the the words that i would choose but i</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">know exactly what you mean by what</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.280" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">you&#39;re demarcating with with that split</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">which is that the full spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:01.119" style="s2">interaction that we get</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:03.440" style="s2">versus the things that we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.119" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2">digitize which is you know audio</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.440" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">and this many rectangular pixels of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">video and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">right um and that&#39;s actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:14.640" style="s2">impoverished um</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">down sample of the the full spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.640" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">uh reality well also throw into this</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:21.119" style="s2">sound is sort of just killed in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">digital medium there&#39;s a biased</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.119" end="00:58:27.040" style="s2">visual what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:27.599" style="s2">the compression of sound takes out the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.040" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">3d</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">nature of sound oh yes our ears can hear</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.559" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">like 10 miles away or</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">very far but just the digital medium</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.599" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">kills that the nuance and richness of</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:40.559" style="s2">sound there is a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:42.160" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.559" end="00:58:44.240" style="s2">the other thing is since we&#39;re all on</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">zoom you only see me from the chest up i</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.240" end="00:58:46.319" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:48.400" style="s2">naked from the waist down right now none</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.319" end="00:58:52.000" style="s2">of you would even know right um</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.400" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">so the the the whole body language</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.000" end="00:58:55.599" style="s2">i try to be live on zoom calls i try to</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">have just sit back enough to where i can</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.599" end="00:58:58.559" style="s2">gesticulate and you at least see my like</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">shoulder and head</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.559" end="00:59:01.839" style="s2">kind of things but when we&#39;re in person</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:03.920" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.839" end="00:59:06.079" style="s2">you know people cross arms people yawn</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.920" end="00:59:07.680" style="s2">and stretch people you know like they</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:09.200" style="s2">slouch they do all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.680" end="00:59:10.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of body language involved</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.200" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">that is completely lost in the zoom</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.799" end="00:59:15.359" style="s2">culture as well so</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:15.359" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:21.359" style="s2">cool um so we&#39;re going to close out here</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.760" end="00:59:22.079" style="s2">before we do i wanted to double click on</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.359" end="00:59:23.599" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.079" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">what was that called information terror</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.599" end="00:59:29.040" style="s2">complex oh yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">i got time if you all have time um</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.040" end="00:59:32.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s uh the good the good news about</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">the information terror complex</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.960" end="00:59:36.640" style="s2">is that it is actually a blog post i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:39.680" style="s2">written a medium</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.640" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">and my point in the blog post was just</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.680" end="00:59:44.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:44.720" style="s2">in fact let&#39;s if i google for it</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t actually come up very much</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.520" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">i&#39;m probably am i the only person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:53.760" style="s2">actually used that term no</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">oh yeah no that&#39;s the uh that&#39;s my blog</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.760" end="00:59:58.799" style="s2">post okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">so i&#39;m i am the a-hole who um</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.799" end="01:00:02.000" style="s2">who popularized this concept here i are</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">not popularized clearly i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.000" end="01:00:06.880" style="s2">popularize it</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:10.880" style="s2">um my point on this was that um</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.880" end="01:00:13.839" style="s2">it is the dissemination</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.880" end="01:00:14.480" style="s2">um so i said this i said look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.839" end="01:00:16.240" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.480" end="01:00:17.680" style="s2">you know how when people when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.240" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">like some kind of suicide attack or some</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.680" end="01:00:19.839" style="s2">kind of thing like that or there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">terror attack</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.839" end="01:00:24.720" style="s2">um they&#39;ll say oh well we&#39;re not giving</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re not like the media will</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.720" end="01:00:28.640" style="s2">say we&#39;re not gonna you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.720" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2">glamorize the the killer or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.640" end="01:00:32.079" style="s2">else we don&#39;t want to have so we have we</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have copycat attacks</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.079" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">they sort of recognize that media itself</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">has a role to play in this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:41.440" style="s2">um and i said look the quickest way to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:43.599" style="s2">actually destroy terrorism</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.440" end="01:00:45.599" style="s2">as a tool would be to institute a</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.599" end="01:00:47.440" style="s2">blanket news media policy</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.599" end="01:00:49.599" style="s2">a total blackout regarding terrorist</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.440" end="01:00:51.760" style="s2">attacks and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.599" end="01:00:53.839" style="s2">um because my point is that an actual</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">terror attack</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.839" end="01:00:57.200" style="s2">only kills a few people uh i mean it</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">sucks for those people and their</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.200" end="01:00:59.760" style="s2">families like i&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">trivialize the tragedy of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.760" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">i mean even 911 it killed thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:06.880" style="s2">people but</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">what creates terrorism is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.880" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">dissemination of information</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">the information impact the medium the</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">way the medium transmits and shocks</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:16.799" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:17.760" style="s2">that is actually that dissemination of</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.799" end="01:01:20.000" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.760" end="01:01:21.040" style="s2">creates the state of terror among the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.000" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.040" end="01:01:25.680" style="s2">so you can say well the jihadists that</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:26.559" style="s2">crashed the planes into the buildings of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.680" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">911</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:29.920" style="s2">they created a lot of corpses and mass</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:32.880" style="s2">death they destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.920" end="01:01:34.960" style="s2">they killed people they&#39;re murderers of</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.880" end="01:01:37.599" style="s2">the highest degree</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.960" end="01:01:39.599" style="s2">but to say they&#39;re terrorists they</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.599" end="01:01:42.240" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be terrorist by themselves</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.599" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">without the global information system</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">amplifying</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:46.880" style="s2">and then writing a lot of additional</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.040" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">narrative on top of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.880" end="01:01:51.760" style="s2">to create a state of terror this is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">really really</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.760" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">weird statement in a sense but i would</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:58.319" style="s2">say it&#39;s kind of incontrovertible</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">right and i said look if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.319" end="01:02:02.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">the the uh what is what i&#39;m called the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.000" end="01:02:05.920" style="s2">guy the jihadi john or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">he goes and he cuts somebody&#39;s throat</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.920" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">you know he slits somebody is in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:10.880" style="s2">like execution</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:12.640" style="s2">um you know over in the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.880" end="01:02:14.319" style="s2">the world for most of us it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.640" end="01:02:16.160" style="s2">okay he killed a person a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.319" end="01:02:17.119" style="s2">get killed all the time in those in that</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.160" end="01:02:19.039" style="s2">part of the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.119" end="01:02:20.960" style="s2">i mean well everywhere in the world but</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:22.640" style="s2">why that one is an act of terrorism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">an act of terrorism because the entire</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.640" end="01:02:25.839" style="s2">media establishment</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:27.920" style="s2">and all of our our mechanisms for</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.839" end="01:02:30.480" style="s2">so-called sense making</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.920" end="01:02:31.520" style="s2">zoom into that and create they induce a</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.480" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">sense of terror</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.520" end="01:02:37.760" style="s2">and fear among the population so</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:39.280" style="s2">my my statement was that our modern</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.760" end="01:02:41.119" style="s2">information dissemination structures</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.280" end="01:02:42.559" style="s2">themselves amplify the act</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.119" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">and they weave into the fabric of our</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.559" end="01:02:46.079" style="s2">national story and we call it journalism</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:49.440" style="s2">we call it news reporting</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">whatever but the susceptibility</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.440" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">to creating terrorism or a terrorism</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">dynamic or creating terror in the people</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">is actually a property of that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:02.319" style="s2">news media environment</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">so this is to the earlier question um</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.319" end="01:03:06.559" style="s2">from who by the question of how do i use</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:07.119" style="s2">this mental framework or these cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.559" end="01:03:08.720" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.119" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">to understand the world this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.720" end="01:03:11.599" style="s2">those examples when you actually go and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:13.119" style="s2">perceive the medium</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.599" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">and you perceive the act of the medium</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.119" end="01:03:17.520" style="s2">itself in a susceptibility</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.640" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">and the way that it is um sort of hacked</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.520" end="01:03:20.640" style="s2">by certain kinds of things that cause it</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:22.559" style="s2">to go into shock</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.640" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">um when you can perceive the medium then</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.559" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">you can see oh wait</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:26.720" style="s2">the medium is at fault the medium is</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:28.720" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.720" end="01:03:30.799" style="s2">well not at fault but the medium is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.720" end="01:03:32.400" style="s2">part of the dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.799" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s why i called the information</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.400" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">terrorism complex i said this</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">when it&#39;s exploited by jihadist groups</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:41.359" style="s2">creates the standing wave pattern which</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">is this fear of random acts of violence</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.359" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.079" end="01:03:46.799" style="s2">um and so and i had this line there by</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:48.160" style="s2">terrorism terrorism by definition</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.799" end="01:03:50.319" style="s2">is the creation of a state of fear</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.160" end="01:03:50.799" style="s2">hysteria among a population and last i</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.319" end="01:03:52.559" style="s2">checked</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.799" end="01:03:53.920" style="s2">isis doesn&#39;t operate any radio towers</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.559" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">here in the united states</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.920" end="01:03:56.799" style="s2">right it is all of the media</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:57.359" style="s2">establishment that operates the media</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.799" end="01:03:59.680" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.359" end="01:04:01.680" style="s2">isis kills people the media creates</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.680" end="01:04:05.520" style="s2">terror creates a state of terror</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.680" end="01:04:08.640" style="s2">and um anyway that&#39;s that&#39;s just uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.520" end="01:04:11.599" style="s2">that was what that was all about</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.640" end="01:04:12.319" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s cool um i really like that</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:13.920" style="s2">meme it</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.319" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">makes me want to explore like humane</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:17.119" style="s2">tech here at the store and all these</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.200" end="01:04:18.799" style="s2">type of uh movements that tristan harris</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.119" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">and others are working on</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.799" end="01:04:24.559" style="s2">um so let&#39;s land the plane here uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:26.400" style="s2">peter any closing thoughts for for this</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.559" end="01:04:28.319" style="s2">session of the series as a whole yes let</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.400" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">me um let me just share this one last</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.319" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">thing here which</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">is i do have i did actually put a</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:36.319" style="s2">conclusion slide in believe it or not</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">so last thoughts here so to net it all</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">out inverse your metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:42.000" style="s2">replace the atomicized object-oriented</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:44.319" style="s2">cartesian model</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">with superpositional right everything</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.319" end="01:04:49.200" style="s2">you think of a solid physical reality</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">um it&#39;s actually the quantization or the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.200" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">reduction of a continuous relationship</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">um of these non-atomized things so learn</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:58.559" style="s2">to see the world in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:05:00.559" style="s2">in that way time is perceptual and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.559" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">driven by frequency and attention</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.559" end="01:05:04.079" style="s2">don&#39;t think of time as just like some</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:05.280" style="s2">like einsteinian fourth dimension and</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.079" end="01:05:08.319" style="s2">all this other nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.280" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">just actually the r general time the way</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.319" end="01:05:10.559" style="s2">you interact with time probably for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:12.160" style="s2">rest of your life</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.559" end="01:05:14.799" style="s2">it&#39;s actually more driven by frequency</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.160" end="01:05:18.160" style="s2">and attention than by any other dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.799" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">and space is relational space is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.160" end="01:05:21.920" style="s2">just meter sticks and yardsticks</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:22.880" style="s2">space is actually especially in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.920" end="01:05:25.520" style="s2">electric age</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.880" end="01:05:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s relational distance is defined</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.520" end="01:05:30.799" style="s2">by our sense of context and control</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.920" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">so um so yeah think about space and time</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.799" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">in those ways</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:35.119" style="s2">and again identity is not atomic either</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not cartesian identity</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.119" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">it&#39;s this tension between our inner</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:39.119" style="s2">selves and motivations the external</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:40.480" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.119" end="01:05:42.559" style="s2">and the medic and environmental field</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.480" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">around us and lastly</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.559" end="01:05:45.760" style="s2">which today&#39;s session and i guess i</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t quite talk about this topic</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.760" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">but i talked all around it which is</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:51.280" style="s2">information is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:52.640" style="s2">a noun information is not an artifact or</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.280" end="01:05:54.640" style="s2">the static thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.640" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">information is a verb that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.640" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">line i stole straight from</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:05:59.839" style="s2">um from from john perry barlow and i</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:02.240" style="s2">guess um</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.839" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">gregory bateson information is a verb it</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.240" end="01:06:05.520" style="s2">is the act of sense making</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">so let&#39;s not think about transmitting</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.520" end="01:06:09.200" style="s2">information let&#39;s think about helping</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">people do better informationing</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.200" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">so that is what i leave all of you</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">wonderful people with</p>
