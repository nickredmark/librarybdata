<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:01:59.369" style="s2">theme which is that they&#39;re happy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">listen to the lectures because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.369" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">helping them clarify their thinking or</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">providing them with words that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">haven&#39;t had before yeah describe things</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">they know that be true or they tell me</p>

<p begin="00:02:14.850" end="00:02:19.770" style="s2">better or it&#39;s a couple that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:22.050" style="s2">decided to get engaged and their</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.050" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">he was doing better with his kids none</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.020" end="00:02:27.150" style="s2">of its political very little of its</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:30.870" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.150" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s maybe 10% political</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.870" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">and I&#39;ll talk to the camera for a second</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">for this because every day when they</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:39.060" style="s2">tell you that Jordans you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:41.450" style="s2">angry white men right that&#39;s it okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.060" end="00:02:45.300" style="s2">first off he&#39;s I would guess it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.450" end="00:02:47.520" style="s2">6040 usually male to female there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.300" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">gay people there are black people white</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.520" end="00:02:52.200" style="s2">people Asian people there were Muslims</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:53.580" style="s2">last night and Jews I mean the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.200" end="00:02:55.860" style="s2">thing all of that diversity that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.580" end="00:02:58.380" style="s2">actually doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s all there</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.860" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">and they just they just consistently lie</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.380" end="00:03:00.980" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:05.610" style="s2">well I think that it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.980" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">the let&#39;s say the mainstream media types</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.610" end="00:03:12.870" style="s2">that have been peering me in various</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">ways don&#39;t have a lexicon for dealing</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.870" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">with a phenomena that&#39;s primarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.370" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2">psychological they have to make this</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">fundamentally political yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">political aspects of it you know insofar</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">as I&#39;m not the family leftist for</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">example and but by the way you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:30.360" style="s2">slamming the the radical right to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">your whole thing I mean this is the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.360" end="00:03:34.830" style="s2">irony of the situation is you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:37.049" style="s2">the identity politics to the right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.830" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">the danger of that as much almost on</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.049" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">stage I don&#39;t like collectivists yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s a bad route and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">takes us down the tribal path and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:47.970" style="s2">think that the end destiny of a tribal</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:49.950" style="s2">path is bloodshed and I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.970" end="00:03:52.140" style="s2">whether it&#39;s the left or the right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.950" end="00:03:54.750" style="s2">more perturbed about the left wing</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:03:57.930" style="s2">because of their dominance in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.750" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">universities in particular and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.930" end="00:04:01.980" style="s2">what you know that&#39;s where Laura this</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:03.900" style="s2">came from but it it&#39;s the collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.980" end="00:04:05.940" style="s2">issue that&#39;s the that&#39;s at hand</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.900" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">and almost everything that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.940" end="00:04:10.110" style="s2">talking about what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:11.870" style="s2">with the audience&#39;s about the Western</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.110" end="00:04:14.190" style="s2">tradition of individual responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.870" end="00:04:15.050" style="s2">essentially also not individual rights</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.190" end="00:04:16.670" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.050" end="00:04:19.430" style="s2">they&#39;re part of the discussion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.670" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">that&#39;s funny to be but I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.430" end="00:04:23.270" style="s2">been in the collectivist lexical and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:24.200" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as free speech and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.270" end="00:04:28.310" style="s2">there&#39;s really no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.200" end="00:04:29.960" style="s2">individual responsibility and so insofar</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.310" end="00:04:31.460" style="s2">as I&#39;m able to make a case for that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.960" end="00:04:33.410" style="s2">makes me an enemy but even more</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.460" end="00:04:35.780" style="s2">importantly it takes the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.410" end="00:04:36.890" style="s2">outside of their the way they frame the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.780" end="00:04:38.680" style="s2">world they don&#39;t know what to do about</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.890" end="00:04:41.630" style="s2">it yeah I don&#39;t know how to handle it so</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.680" end="00:04:42.700" style="s2">they invent an enemy essentially right</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.630" end="00:04:44.930" style="s2">they don&#39;t really do the work</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.700" end="00:04:46.910" style="s2">intellectually to counter the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.930" end="00:04:48.170" style="s2">so they just do the same old thing we</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.910" end="00:04:50.930" style="s2">were saying right before we started how</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.170" end="00:04:52.610" style="s2">I didn&#39;t year and a half ago we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.930" end="00:04:54.650" style="s2">even know each other no the first time</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.610" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2">we ever did anything together was I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.650" end="00:04:59.720" style="s2">think it was November 2nd of 2016 which</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:01.880" style="s2">was a day or two before the American</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.720" end="00:05:03.500" style="s2">election it feels like a lifetime again</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.880" end="00:05:05.420" style="s2">we did I just moved into my house I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.500" end="00:05:07.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t have my studio yet and we did a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.420" end="00:05:09.200" style="s2">little Google hangout thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.010" end="00:05:10.970" style="s2">audio was terrible the video is bad and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.200" end="00:05:12.470" style="s2">you were telling me that the Pinocchio&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.970" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">memory which now most dear audience</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.470" end="00:05:16.520" style="s2">knows about and you were getting teary</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">eyed on it and it ended and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.520" end="00:05:19.910" style="s2">and truly I&#39;ve been excited to you I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:21.920" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know exactly what to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.910" end="00:05:24.140" style="s2">of this guy and then subsequently you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.920" end="00:05:25.940" style="s2">came on my show many times and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.140" end="00:05:28.670" style="s2">done a couple hours together and we did</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.940" end="00:05:30.620" style="s2">sit down you Shapiro and it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.670" end="00:05:32.600" style="s2">three month or two months this thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.620" end="00:05:36.140" style="s2">just levels up levels up and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.600" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">more real it feels more concrete and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.140" end="00:05:39.710" style="s2">we&#39;re all kind of growing together yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:41.390" style="s2">but I got to tell you man we crossed six</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.710" end="00:05:42.620" style="s2">hundred thousand YouTube subscribers I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.390" end="00:05:45.830" style="s2">think on the same day</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.620" end="00:05:51.230" style="s2">you got like 1.2 right now I&#39;m almost at</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.830" end="00:05:53.410" style="s2">800 I&#39;m starting I like competition I do</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.030" end="00:07:27.230" style="s2">what&#39;s being protested yeah I think so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.610" end="00:07:29.390" style="s2">think that&#39;s the plan when we do these</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.230" end="00:07:31.100" style="s2">they&#39;ve pretty much been different every</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.390" end="00:07:33.290" style="s2">single night I mean we&#39;ve done about 15</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.100" end="00:07:34.130" style="s2">shows and I I mix it up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.290" end="00:07:35.630" style="s2">every night you know there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.130" end="00:07:37.760" style="s2">jokes in there that are the mainstays</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.630" end="00:07:40.130" style="s2">some lobster stuff and the rest but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.760" end="00:07:41.900" style="s2">well you can&#39;t dispatch the lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.130" end="00:07:43.430" style="s2">have to be in there but but you pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.900" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">much have an hour and a half that you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.430" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">and then especially when we do the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:49.190" style="s2">after which is totally off-the-cuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:50.990" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of just going in and out and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.190" end="00:07:52.550" style="s2">and sometimes you do three rules</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.990" end="00:07:53.810" style="s2">sometimes you do a rule sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.550" end="00:07:56.540" style="s2">know rules and yeah it&#39;s kind of amazing</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.810" end="00:08:00.230" style="s2">yeah well I&#39;m trying to develop a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.540" end="00:08:02.060" style="s2">large corpus of stories around each of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.230" end="00:08:04.130" style="s2">the chapters and then I can mix and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.060" end="00:08:06.050" style="s2">match them and I&#39;m also trying to push</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.130" end="00:08:07.670" style="s2">the ideas that I&#39;ve been developing in</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.050" end="00:08:09.620" style="s2">the book farther ahead with each talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.670" end="00:08:11.870" style="s2">yeah and so I spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.620" end="00:08:13.670" style="s2">talking about the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.870" end="00:08:18.440" style="s2">hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.670" end="00:08:20.690" style="s2">goals and and and difference in status</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.440" end="00:08:24.430" style="s2">that&#39;s been a that&#39;s been a main theme</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.690" end="00:08:27.020" style="s2">and the relationship between truth and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.430" end="00:08:28.910" style="s2">quality of existence that&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.020" end="00:08:31.700" style="s2">that there&#39;s a very powerful positive</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.910" end="00:08:33.920" style="s2">relationship there necessary and so in</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.700" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">all of those themes you know there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.920" end="00:08:37.490" style="s2">end to the amount you can develop them</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:40.010" style="s2">and each venue gives me an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.490" end="00:08:41.960" style="s2">to push it a little bit farther and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.010" end="00:08:43.610" style="s2">clarify what I&#39;m thinking and get the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.960" end="00:08:45.980" style="s2">story a little bit tighter and see how B</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.610" end="00:08:48.770" style="s2">or D and see how the individuals in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.980" end="00:08:50.890" style="s2">audience are reacting yeah and so I like</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.770" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">the fact that you open with some</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.890" end="00:08:56.570" style="s2">humorous intro and that the QA has a an</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.220" style="s2">element of lightness and comedy in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.570" end="00:08:59.780" style="s2">because one of the things I learned a</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.220" end="00:09:01.460" style="s2">long time ago was that even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.780" end="00:09:03.770" style="s2">dealing with something that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.460" end="00:09:06.260" style="s2">serious if you can&#39;t do it with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.770" end="00:09:07.850" style="s2">comedic touch then you haven&#39;t got the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.260" end="00:09:09.830" style="s2">balance right even if it&#39;s deadly</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.850" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">serious stuff yeah and they look they</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.830" end="00:09:13.490" style="s2">love it when when you make them laugh</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:15.260" style="s2">sometimes accidentally even like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.490" end="00:09:17.030" style="s2">like they love that they really love</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.260" end="00:09:19.100" style="s2">seeing that other&#39;s idea yeah that&#39;s</p>
