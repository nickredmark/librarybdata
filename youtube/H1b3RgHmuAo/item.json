    "description": "Please join our host Lama Tantrapa in discussing integral process philosophy with Bonnitta Roy - who once served as the President of the National Qigong Association. Now she is an associate editor of the internationally acclaimed Integral Review Journal.\n\nHer Insight Training program is dedicated to helping people tap into the transformational power of the mind in its natural state. Insight Training workshops activate intuitive awareness by cultivating the ability to perceive the world directly, and the capacity to experience equanimity. When mind is in its natural state, we can discover what is possible that has never been possible before.",
