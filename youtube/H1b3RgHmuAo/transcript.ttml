<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:03:01.230" style="s2">quite a few years and I finally got an</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">opportunity to interview on our show</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.230" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2">it&#39;s really a treat yeah and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">was listening to the introduction and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.800" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">and I was thinking of this notion of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:18.140" style="s2">path you know how how we knew each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">in the National Qigong Association and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.140" end="00:03:22.950" style="s2">and then our lives take on these</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.640" style="s2">different paths and I thought I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.950" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">just start by talking a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.640" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">how I got from there to here and giving</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">that as an orientation I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:40.709" style="s2">hear your story it&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:44.670" style="s2">fascinating path that you&#39;re in yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.709" end="00:03:48.540" style="s2">so you know for me it&#39;s all about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.670" end="00:03:51.450" style="s2">been both an inquiry like an</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">investigation and an experiment you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.450" end="00:04:00.530" style="s2">I&#39;m always trying to explore new</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:04:04.890" style="s2">territory and one of the things that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.530" end="00:04:09.510" style="s2">interesting to me when I was deep inside</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.890" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">the Qigong community was how how people</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.510" end="00:04:15.690" style="s2">could come together and do Qigong and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:19.410" style="s2">get into really see president doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.690" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">practices like Chaney son or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.410" end="00:04:27.130" style="s2">deep organ alchemy all these practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:29.980" style="s2">were very extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.130" end="00:04:32.770" style="s2">and and very intimate I mean you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.980" end="00:04:34.980" style="s2">get people into a room and become really</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.770" end="00:04:39.550" style="s2">intimate with them in an embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.980" end="00:04:41.800" style="s2">resonant way and and yet when when</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.550" end="00:04:45.300" style="s2">people got together to do collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.800" end="00:04:47.620" style="s2">work let&#39;s say as board members or on</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.300" end="00:04:49.240" style="s2">projects something funny would happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.620" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">when we&#39;d start to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.240" end="00:04:55.030" style="s2">you know like like there was this deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:58.660" style="s2">embodied residence in Qigong itself but</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.030" end="00:05:00.930" style="s2">then when we all got together to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.660" end="00:05:04.390" style="s2">problem or talk about real-world issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.930" end="00:05:06.700" style="s2">there was just too much dissonance and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.390" end="00:05:08.530" style="s2">too much cognitive dissonance and and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.700" end="00:05:11.260" style="s2">thought that was very interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.530" end="00:05:13.990" style="s2">know that that the embodied work didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.260" end="00:05:16.360" style="s2">solve these other problems you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.990" end="00:05:20.200" style="s2">remember that some occasions we would</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.360" end="00:05:23.410" style="s2">actually have this amazing breakthroughs</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.200" end="00:05:27.580" style="s2">I remember for example the springboard</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.410" end="00:05:29.050" style="s2">retreat I think it was 2005 when we went</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.580" end="00:05:32.170" style="s2">to North Carolina</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.050" end="00:05:36.610" style="s2">yes and stayed at the retreat center</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.170" end="00:05:39.130" style="s2">there with several members of the board</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.610" end="00:05:42.130" style="s2">of directors all coming together from</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.130" end="00:05:43.800" style="s2">all over the United States and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.130" end="00:05:46.600" style="s2">actually had some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.800" end="00:05:49.810" style="s2">breakthroughs there I think and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.600" end="00:05:52.540" style="s2">some other board meetings when like</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.810" end="00:05:55.630" style="s2">after 10 years of bickering for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.540" end="00:05:57.700" style="s2">about the designation of what does it</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.630" end="00:05:59.500" style="s2">mean to practice Qigong you know we</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.700" end="00:06:01.660" style="s2">would actually like MRAP</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.500" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">the definition of Qigong or even I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.660" end="00:06:10.270" style="s2">agreed on what certificate certification</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:13.420" style="s2">levels would be that the MQA we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.270" end="00:06:15.460" style="s2">we&#39;re pada sunders yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.420" end="00:06:17.020" style="s2">so those things but those things really</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.460" end="00:06:18.970" style="s2">shined right so when you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.020" end="00:06:21.160" style="s2">breakthrough I call it insight now and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.970" end="00:06:24.670" style="s2">when it with a group can have an insight</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.160" end="00:06:27.580" style="s2">any like really break through that wall</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.670" end="00:06:30.130" style="s2">or those were tough relational dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.580" end="00:06:34.180" style="s2">something interesting is happening right</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.130" end="00:06:36.600" style="s2">so I started really try to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.180" end="00:06:40.020" style="s2">to that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.600" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">and study it you know you can look at it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.020" end="00:06:43.800" style="s2">as a type of Qigong you know with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:46.350" style="s2">different type of energy you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.800" end="00:06:50.730" style="s2">have the relational dynamics between</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.350" end="00:06:52.560" style="s2">people is is relational flow and like</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.730" end="00:06:55.800" style="s2">push hands OMA</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like push hands exactly it seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.800" end="00:07:01.020" style="s2">like push hands there&#39;s can be pushing</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:02.700" style="s2">is the art of push hands right when it</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.020" end="00:07:03.390" style="s2">becomes really beautiful it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.700" end="00:07:06.390" style="s2">dance</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.390" end="00:07:08.460" style="s2">versus an amateur version of push hands</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.390" end="00:07:10.830" style="s2">where it just looks like competitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.460" end="00:07:13.290" style="s2">battling you know it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.830" end="00:07:16.710" style="s2">there&#39;s no beauty in it right so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.290" end="00:07:20.640" style="s2">question is how to get the beauty in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.710" end="00:07:23.130" style="s2">actual collaborative work that when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.640" end="00:07:26.100" style="s2">start to need to talk to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.130" end="00:07:28.680" style="s2">work in with ideas and and in that in</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.100" end="00:07:33.390" style="s2">that realm and what are the principles</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.680" end="00:07:36.750" style="s2">that we can utilize to make that work</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.390" end="00:07:40.410" style="s2">more like flow and and to really release</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.750" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">the creativity so one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.410" end="00:07:46.440" style="s2">say is most groups look for they either</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:51.060" style="s2">interact in terms of competition like</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.440" end="00:07:54.600" style="s2">our Congress does or consensus which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.060" end="00:07:56.760" style="s2">very difficult to work toward consensus</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.600" end="00:07:59.760" style="s2">or compromise and the problem with those</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.760" end="00:08:03.600" style="s2">three is they don&#39;t really tap into</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.760" end="00:08:05.250" style="s2">creativity right so right so if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.600" end="00:08:07.890" style="s2">think of push hands you know when people</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.250" end="00:08:10.110" style="s2">are doing push hands and there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.890" end="00:08:12.150" style="s2">there&#39;s certain skills that create the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.110" end="00:08:15.930" style="s2">dance that is so creative and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.150" end="00:08:19.830" style="s2">spontaneous as opposed to you know just</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.930" end="00:08:22.350" style="s2">the same old same old so I read the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.830" end="00:08:24.390" style="s2">choreographies there&#39;s a choreography</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.350" end="00:08:28.410" style="s2">but it&#39;s spontaneous but it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.390" end="00:08:30.150" style="s2">bit it&#39;s not pre-primed you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.410" end="00:08:33.960" style="s2">started working with groups I worked</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.150" end="00:08:37.050" style="s2">with a core group on a biodynamic farm</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.960" end="00:08:41.640" style="s2">and and some educational groups and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.050" end="00:08:44.910" style="s2">and I kept getting this feeling that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.640" end="00:08:47.220" style="s2">there was more creativity in the people</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.910" end="00:08:49.230" style="s2">than in the group as a whole and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.220" end="00:08:49.490" style="s2">would think the opposite you know that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.230" end="00:08:52.550" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.490" end="00:08:55.580" style="s2">group would would have more creativity</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.550" end="00:08:58.279" style="s2">like the total is greater than the sum</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.580" end="00:09:01.820" style="s2">of its parts and so that&#39;s I started to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.279" end="00:09:05.149" style="s2">look at it and in in those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.820" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">questions I certainly would love to ask</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.149" end="00:09:10.970" style="s2">you more about that let me remind our</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.060" end="00:09:13.190" style="s2">listeners that you&#39;re listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.970" end="00:09:15.800" style="s2">interview with Bonita Roy on the talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.190" end="00:09:19.250" style="s2">show the secrets of sugar masters and if</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.800" end="00:09:22.459" style="s2">you have any questions about the subject</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.250" end="00:09:25.850" style="s2">of our interview today please call in at</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.459" end="00:09:29.779" style="s2">three four seven three two seven nine</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.850" end="00:09:37.820" style="s2">six three five once again the : number</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.779" end="00:09:44.690" style="s2">is 3 4 7 3 2 7 9 6 3 5 so neither let me</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.820" end="00:09:48.680" style="s2">ask you about the path that perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.690" end="00:09:51.320" style="s2">took from being deeply involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.680" end="00:09:53.180" style="s2">chi-gong world obviously you were a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.320" end="00:09:56.420" style="s2">president of the National Chicken</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.180" end="00:10:00.010" style="s2">Association at some point and to where</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.420" end="00:10:02.660" style="s2">you are at right now what were the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.010" end="00:10:05.810" style="s2">milestones so to speak or the landmarks</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.660" end="00:10:09.410" style="s2">that perhaps were the turning points</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.810" end="00:10:12.140" style="s2">along your path that&#39;s a good question I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.410" end="00:10:16.510" style="s2">started to use what I would feel would</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.140" end="00:10:21.560" style="s2">call Qigong practices and principles in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.510" end="00:10:25.930" style="s2">my work as a I was operations manager of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.560" end="00:10:31.959" style="s2">a large landscape contracting firm and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.930" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">started to become very aware of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.959" end="00:10:40.339" style="s2">relational dynamics not as words going</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:44.529" style="s2">back and forth or or the actual content</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.339" end="00:10:47.560" style="s2">of words but as as flow as you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.529" end="00:10:52.040" style="s2">started to feel for example the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.560" end="00:10:54.529" style="s2">push-pull of relational dynamics as you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.040" end="00:10:57.380" style="s2">had a big board meeting or a big</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.529" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">business meeting we have clients in</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.380" end="00:11:03.439" style="s2">there I started to become very sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:06.889" style="s2">to the energy flow</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.439" end="00:11:10.579" style="s2">and started to work or with the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.889" end="00:11:13.910" style="s2">quality of the energy then with a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.579" end="00:11:19.899" style="s2">specific intention about the outcome so</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.910" end="00:11:24.109" style="s2">I started practicing that at work and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.899" end="00:11:27.769" style="s2">then we moved to this farm and I ended</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.109" end="00:11:30.999" style="s2">up being able to live with my horses and</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.769" end="00:11:33.289" style="s2">had a couple of horses born here and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.999" end="00:11:36.949" style="s2">started to work with the horses in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.289" end="00:11:40.039" style="s2">herd situation from the horses that were</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.949" end="00:11:43.189" style="s2">not conventionally trained in a herd</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.039" end="00:11:46.129" style="s2">situation and started to really watch</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.189" end="00:11:48.829" style="s2">and feel and become sensitive to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.129" end="00:11:51.649" style="s2">relational flows there and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.829" end="00:11:55.069" style="s2">say that was the turning point for me is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.649" end="00:11:59.599" style="s2">to be sensitive to what was going on is</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.069" end="00:12:01.879" style="s2">a total dynamic rather than this person</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.599" end="00:12:04.819" style="s2">said this and then this person said that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.879" end="00:12:07.579" style="s2">and and now and the whole in inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.819" end="00:12:08.989" style="s2">opened up opened up for me so actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.579" end="00:12:12.019" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.989" end="00:12:15.439" style="s2">similar to what someone like yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.019" end="00:12:18.679" style="s2">who teaches people in groups it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.439" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">is that&#39;s part of a technique that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.679" end="00:12:25.879" style="s2">important to your work well absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:28.399" style="s2">work with people both in group context</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.879" end="00:12:30.619" style="s2">as well as individually one-on-one my</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.399" end="00:12:33.799" style="s2">favorite actually is to work with two</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.619" end="00:12:37.339" style="s2">people at the same time and this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.799" end="00:12:40.069" style="s2">of an unusual almost unique form of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.339" end="00:12:42.679" style="s2">Qigong coaching that I developed because</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.069" end="00:12:46.009" style="s2">I discovered that it works more</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.679" end="00:12:48.319" style="s2">efficiently to work with two people as</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.009" end="00:12:51.109" style="s2">practice partners who kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.319" end="00:12:54.129" style="s2">consistently practice with each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.109" end="00:12:57.679" style="s2">and I can provide them an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.129" end="00:13:00.649" style="s2">improve not only on their own but also</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.679" end="00:13:03.319" style="s2">they start collaborating in helping each</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.649" end="00:13:05.449" style="s2">other improve is only in their skill</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.319" end="00:13:07.789" style="s2">level but also in their communication</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.449" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">style and their quality of life in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.789" end="00:13:14.239" style="s2">general and the dead essentially creates</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:16.069" style="s2">the totally different dynamics between</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.239" end="00:13:17.390" style="s2">people they&#39;re not just benefiting from</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.069" end="00:13:20.620" style="s2">knowing each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.390" end="00:13:24.530" style="s2">or from knowing me but there is a a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.620" end="00:13:26.350" style="s2">energy shield that we enter together is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.530" end="00:13:29.450" style="s2">this something similar to what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.350" end="00:13:34.040" style="s2">experienced when you teach the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.450" end="00:13:39.260" style="s2">collective insight yeah so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.040" end="00:13:40.940" style="s2">aspect of it and I find there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.260" end="00:13:44.680" style="s2">two levels going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.940" end="00:13:48.350" style="s2">I find it relatively easy for people to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.680" end="00:13:50.530" style="s2">become resonant as you&#39;re describing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.350" end="00:13:55.790" style="s2">be wanted to be helpful with each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.530" end="00:13:59.630" style="s2">to settle into a field where everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.790" end="00:14:04.370" style="s2">very present and people are sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.630" end="00:14:09.320" style="s2">each other and the you know the field</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.370" end="00:14:13.330" style="s2">feels very intense the the second level</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.320" end="00:14:16.400" style="s2">though is if you is when you introduce a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.330" end="00:14:19.970" style="s2">question or a problem where people hold</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.400" end="00:14:24.190" style="s2">diverse sometimes very competing</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.970" end="00:14:27.830" style="s2">opinions then what happens is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.190" end="00:14:31.040" style="s2">something something disrupt you know it</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.830" end="00:14:32.450" style="s2">gets very disruptive very fast and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.040" end="00:14:33.560" style="s2">are you talking about the board of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.450" end="00:14:36.080" style="s2">directors of nqa</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.560" end="00:14:38.390" style="s2">oh I&#39;m talking about many groups that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.080" end="00:14:40.490" style="s2">work and so you know instead of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.390" end="00:14:43.250" style="s2">climate change in this climate change</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.490" end="00:14:45.560" style="s2">skeptics and climate change you know so</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.250" end="00:14:49.400" style="s2">the same people that just spent two days</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.560" end="00:14:51.350" style="s2">together in nature doing Qigong feeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.400" end="00:14:52.970" style="s2">really cooking together feeling good</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.350" end="00:14:55.220" style="s2">about each other and then you sit down</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.970" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">to have some what I call you know some</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.220" end="00:15:01.700" style="s2">deliberate speech around problems or</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:04.580" style="s2">issues then you find that the situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.700" end="00:15:07.520" style="s2">gets complicated really fast and so what</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.580" end="00:15:10.820" style="s2">I try to teach and collective insight is</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.520" end="00:15:12.710" style="s2">what capacities we need to maintain this</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.820" end="00:15:15.230" style="s2">kind of being present with each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.710" end="00:15:17.300" style="s2">similar to what you said that breaks or</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.230" end="00:15:19.430" style="s2">we had in the National Qigong</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.300" end="00:15:21.590" style="s2">Association it took you know three or</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.430" end="00:15:24.080" style="s2">four days going in or two or three days</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.590" end="00:15:27.380" style="s2">going in to keep setting the field and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.080" end="00:15:29.420" style="s2">setting it and keeping me awesome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.380" end="00:15:31.139" style="s2">and there was okay together in hot tubs</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.420" end="00:15:32.609" style="s2">you know getting to know each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.139" end="00:15:34.230" style="s2">a little bit better so we don&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.609" end="00:15:37.170" style="s2">each other like what kind of freak</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.230" end="00:15:39.540" style="s2">person is this exactly but then even</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.170" end="00:15:41.549" style="s2">then there are these really tough times</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.540" end="00:15:43.889" style="s2">you know and whether whether the groups</p>

<p begin="00:15:43.889" end="00:15:50.459" style="s2">collapse there there&#39;s a hole to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.639" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a hole genius or skill set in</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.459" end="00:15:55.919" style="s2">groups that learn to really work</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:59.069" style="s2">together and create insight you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.919" end="00:16:01.529" style="s2">idea of collective insight is that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.069" end="00:16:07.259" style="s2">you have five people that come together</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.529" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">and everybody has their own way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.259" end="00:16:12.359" style="s2">thinking about something in collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:16.169" style="s2">excite you don&#39;t want any of those five</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.359" end="00:16:17.759" style="s2">people to leave with one of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.169" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">that they came in with you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.759" end="00:16:24.839" style="s2">everybody is going to go away with a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:28.049" style="s2">idea it&#39;s not like three people can</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.839" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">convince the other two people or two</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.049" end="00:16:32.999" style="s2">people are going to convince the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:35.220" style="s2">three people it&#39;s warm chocolate knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.999" end="00:16:38.339" style="s2">that they want to get beyond everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.220" end="00:16:43.829" style="s2">they know and and and that creates a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.339" end="00:16:45.829" style="s2">of creativity right well and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.829" end="00:16:48.860" style="s2">definitely is something that probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.829" end="00:16:52.860" style="s2">helps people involved in this type of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.860" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">creative collaborative group dynamics to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.860" end="00:17:00.139" style="s2">only have insights but also there to</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:03.299" style="s2">step up to the next higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.139" end="00:17:06.569" style="s2">creativity so you know just having a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.299" end="00:17:09.659" style="s2">high experience perhaps to say oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.569" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">how oh that&#39;s why this person believes</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.659" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">this way now I understand up but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:20.189" style="s2">go beyond what&#39;s easy one of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:24.149" style="s2">understood anything together and and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.189" end="00:17:26.519" style="s2">and in order to do that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.149" end="00:17:28.230" style="s2">relational dynamics you know and as as</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.519" end="00:17:30.149" style="s2">you described especially if you can get</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.230" end="00:17:32.450" style="s2">people helping each other and moving</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.149" end="00:17:36.529" style="s2">each other along and not being in a</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.529" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">there&#39;s you know people have triggers</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.899" end="00:17:45.000" style="s2">and they have defense mechanisms all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:47.160" style="s2">this everything that you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.000" end="00:17:50.340" style="s2">doing Qigong to get people to open up</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.160" end="00:17:53.250" style="s2">and be grounded and opened up and be</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.340" end="00:17:58.290" style="s2">confident without being aggressive these</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.250" end="00:18:02.010" style="s2">are all embodied ways to sustain the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.290" end="00:18:05.640" style="s2">kind of challenge that it is to really</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.010" end="00:18:10.250" style="s2">work through differences and diverse</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.640" end="00:18:13.980" style="s2">opinions into a new new insight</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.250" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">wonderful let me ask you exactly what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.980" end="00:18:18.270" style="s2">the meaning of the words insight from</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:21.150" style="s2">your report I mean by insight that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.270" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">really good question so what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.150" end="00:18:27.690" style="s2">insight is an insight could be small or</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:32.820" style="s2">could be significant but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.690" end="00:18:36.480" style="s2">aspects of an insight is that if we ate</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.820" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">a whole new way of looking at things so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.480" end="00:18:42.780" style="s2">it solves a lot of problems at the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:44.850" style="s2">time so for example let&#39;s say you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.780" end="00:18:47.430" style="s2">I&#39;m always fighting with my boss and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.850" end="00:18:49.590" style="s2">there&#39;s always you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.430" end="00:18:52.440" style="s2">working there for a while but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.590" end="00:18:55.560" style="s2">always some kind of irritation you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.440" end="00:18:58.890" style="s2">I know yeah I know Aidan and then one</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.560" end="00:19:01.680" style="s2">day something happens you know just I</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.890" end="00:19:03.780" style="s2">may be relaxed or you might say</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.680" end="00:19:07.020" style="s2">something all of a sudden something</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.780" end="00:19:09.720" style="s2">switches and I realized that the problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.020" end="00:19:11.910" style="s2">I have with my boss is the same problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.720" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">I have with my husband and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.910" end="00:19:16.290" style="s2">problem that I have with my father it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:20.010" style="s2">like you have an insight that just shows</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.290" end="00:19:22.620" style="s2">you that all you know it shows you more</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.010" end="00:19:25.410" style="s2">than one thing it shows this if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.620" end="00:19:29.070" style="s2">a switch in perception and the way you</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.410" end="00:19:32.730" style="s2">see things and out of that cascades many</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.070" end="00:19:34.620" style="s2">many different understandings right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.730" end="00:19:37.700" style="s2">then that&#39;s there in other words there</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.620" end="00:19:39.720" style="s2">you&#39;re connected dots you see certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.700" end="00:19:42.210" style="s2">connections between things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.720" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">previously appear to be disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.210" end="00:19:50.100" style="s2">yeah and you feel almost almost like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:54.090" style="s2">antithesis of ignorance ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.100" end="00:19:56.040" style="s2">basically is not knowing the connections</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.090" end="00:19:59.299" style="s2">the karmic connections that cause and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.040" end="00:20:01.970" style="s2">effect and insight is almost the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.299" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2">a reversal of ignorance it&#39;s it&#39;s yet</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.970" end="00:20:07.070" style="s2">and an insight is I liked what you said</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:09.710" style="s2">about connecting the dots because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.070" end="00:20:12.679" style="s2">usually comes out as a pattern you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.710" end="00:20:17.480" style="s2">like it tells you a lot all at the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.679" end="00:20:20.409" style="s2">time and so it creates one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.480" end="00:20:22.580" style="s2">stories of insights I ever heard was on</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.409" end="00:20:25.249" style="s2">National Public Radio and it was the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.580" end="00:20:30.649" style="s2">story of this man who&#39;s grown up in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.249" end="00:20:33.080" style="s2">Inn in South LA and he was always a gang</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.649" end="00:20:35.539" style="s2">member you know his brother was and he</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.080" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">was ever since he was young and he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.539" end="00:20:41.269" style="s2">about 16 or 17 and he really wanted out</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:43.249" style="s2">but he couldn&#39;t get out because it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.269" end="00:20:45.710" style="s2">like if he left and they were torturers</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.249" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">you know it was there was there was he</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.710" end="00:20:50.840" style="s2">was so he could he was so locked in and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:54.019" style="s2">then something shifted and he realized</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.840" end="00:20:56.359" style="s2">he could just walk away they just left</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.019" end="00:20:58.730" style="s2">la he left his whole life all of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.359" end="00:21:00.889" style="s2">sudden the whole thing just shifted and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.730" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">he realized that there was nothing</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.889" end="00:21:06.649" style="s2">really he wasn&#39;t really locked in except</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:09.529" style="s2">by his own perception you know so this</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.649" end="00:21:13.159" style="s2">is an insane he just he just walked away</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.529" end="00:21:16.149" style="s2">and it says it&#39;s something that actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.159" end="00:21:19.659" style="s2">allowed him to experience freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.149" end="00:21:24.619" style="s2">freedom was not because he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.659" end="00:21:28.399" style="s2">incarcerated or he was chained down but</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.619" end="00:21:30.769" style="s2">he was actually the basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.399" end="00:21:33.619" style="s2">orchestrating his own incarceration of</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.769" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">sorts or lack of freedom when he was I</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.619" end="00:21:40.429" style="s2">can perspective right it exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:42.999" style="s2">probably associated with fear</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.429" end="00:21:45.889" style="s2">most people get stuck in perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.999" end="00:21:47.690" style="s2">because they&#39;re afraid that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.889" end="00:21:51.950" style="s2">outside of this perspective is going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.690" end="00:21:56.690" style="s2">be scary unknown or worse than what they</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.950" end="00:21:59.119" style="s2">experiencing now exactly and and because</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.690" end="00:22:01.759" style="s2">you never because you&#39;re so afraid you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.119" end="00:22:04.309" style="s2">can&#39;t look outside your perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.759" end="00:22:07.759" style="s2">if you could you would find that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.309" end="00:22:10.029" style="s2">not that scary anyways but in once as</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.759" end="00:22:13.010" style="s2">long as you&#39;re inside your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.029" end="00:22:14.980" style="s2">then it becomes a real</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.010" end="00:22:19.250" style="s2">challenging thing to get outside of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.980" end="00:22:21.980" style="s2">is the reason why collective insight is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.250" end="00:22:25.250" style="s2">easier to have done insight by yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.980" end="00:22:28.100" style="s2">is because you&#39;re connected with people</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.250" end="00:22:29.810" style="s2">who have different perspectives I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.100" end="00:22:32.180" style="s2">obviously some people may have similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.810" end="00:22:35.330" style="s2">perspectives to yours but by and large</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.180" end="00:22:38.000" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be some diversity among</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.330" end="00:22:40.600" style="s2">a group of people and the more you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:43.040" style="s2">develop a relationship with these people</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.600" end="00:22:45.290" style="s2">the more you realize that well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.040" end="00:22:49.460" style="s2">not stupid so their perspectives are not</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.290" end="00:22:52.970" style="s2">really that bad and even though they</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.460" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">hold those perspective they don&#39;t suffer</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.970" end="00:22:59.030" style="s2">from scary things that I thought I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">have to experience if I switch to some</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.030" end="00:23:04.970" style="s2">other perspective from my old one</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:11.060" style="s2">exactly so there&#39;s a two-fold thing here</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.970" end="00:23:13.910" style="s2">the more diverse the group is in it when</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.060" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have the skillset in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.910" end="00:23:19.220" style="s2">collective the more difficult it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:21.620" style="s2">because people will start holding on to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.220" end="00:23:22.360" style="s2">their perspective as the only one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.620" end="00:23:26.360" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.360" end="00:23:29.510" style="s2">but once the group starts to trust and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.360" end="00:23:31.970" style="s2">open up then there&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.510" end="00:23:34.820" style="s2">possibility for insight because you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.970" end="00:23:38.180" style="s2">more perspectives on the problems you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.820" end="00:23:41.090" style="s2">have more views and you have more</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.180" end="00:23:44.840" style="s2">intelligence so that the insight that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.090" end="00:23:48.010" style="s2">you drive becomes more significant and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.840" end="00:23:50.750" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a little tricky because</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.010" end="00:23:53.030" style="s2">you have when you know at first if</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.750" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">people are not skilled in this then they</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.030" end="00:23:58.580" style="s2">tend it tends to have you have you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:00.530" style="s2">instead of one person that&#39;s obstructing</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.580" end="00:24:02.630" style="s2">themselves you have five people</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.530" end="00:24:06.170" style="s2">obstructing themselves and their</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.630" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">interpersonal exchange but once you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.170" end="00:24:11.570" style="s2">crack that then then the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:15.230" style="s2">possibility and the collective insight</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.570" end="00:24:18.140" style="s2">is is it can be truly remarkable well</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.230" end="00:24:22.250" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what exactly I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.140" end="00:24:24.170" style="s2">cracking to me it&#39;s more like a melting</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.250" end="00:24:25.680" style="s2">ice so to speak rather than trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.170" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">break through it</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.680" end="00:24:32.700" style="s2">how do you crack how do you facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:35.460" style="s2">this melting of the boundaries that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.700" end="00:24:37.140" style="s2">people hold you know the walls that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.460" end="00:24:40.470" style="s2">erect around themselves and around their</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.140" end="00:24:42.990" style="s2">perspectives yeah I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.470" end="00:24:45.510" style="s2">relational dynamics are more like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.990" end="00:24:47.580" style="s2">word melting your melting them so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.510" end="00:24:49.560" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re not bump you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.580" end="00:24:52.260" style="s2">so that they&#39;re fluid they become much</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.560" end="00:24:54.810" style="s2">more fluid and I use the word crack in</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.260" end="00:24:58.830" style="s2">terms of like crack the problem or crack</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.810" end="00:25:01.350" style="s2">the you know more of the the obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.830" end="00:25:04.500" style="s2">look that you&#39;re working on a certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.350" end="00:25:08.930" style="s2">problem or certain come on wonder if I</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.500" end="00:25:11.970" style="s2">can contribute another insight into this</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.930" end="00:25:16.200" style="s2">conversation I don&#39;t know if even</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.970" end="00:25:18.570" style="s2">problem is the most helpful term within</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.200" end="00:25:20.400" style="s2">this particular dynamics or context</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.570" end="00:25:23.730" style="s2">because when people think that they have</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.400" end="00:25:25.530" style="s2">a problem they relate to it in such a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.730" end="00:25:27.210" style="s2">way that they want to crack it or they</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.530" end="00:25:32.730" style="s2">want to get rid of it or they want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.210" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">break through but once you actually get</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.730" end="00:25:38.850" style="s2">beyond the perception of problem as such</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:40.050" style="s2">you start actually pursuing it as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.850" end="00:25:42.150" style="s2">learning opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.050" end="00:25:44.520" style="s2">I guess you ever experience the problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.150" end="00:25:47.400" style="s2">in the past and then he looks back maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.520" end="00:25:49.350" style="s2">years later or even decades later you</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.400" end="00:25:51.810" style="s2">realize oh wow that was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.350" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">profound learning opportunity from which</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.810" end="00:25:56.370" style="s2">I grew great deal and it made me</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:59.670" style="s2">stronger wiser or somehow well better</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.370" end="00:26:02.970" style="s2">off that&#39;s exactly right and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.670" end="00:26:05.870" style="s2">about in two ways one is at first you</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.970" end="00:26:08.610" style="s2">know from on this side of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.870" end="00:26:10.440" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for solutions on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.610" end="00:26:12.450" style="s2">other side you don&#39;t really find</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.440" end="00:26:14.360" style="s2">solutions you find that the problems</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.450" end="00:26:17.700" style="s2">actually dissolved you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.360" end="00:26:20.940" style="s2">get your whole orientation to what what</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:23.970" style="s2">you started out has also shifted so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.940" end="00:26:27.420" style="s2">exactly so that&#39;s exactly true and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.970" end="00:26:30.390" style="s2">and then the the second thing is once</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.420" end="00:26:35.220" style="s2">you get the hang of it you you actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.390" end="00:26:37.980" style="s2">start enjoying those groups where there</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.220" end="00:26:39.090" style="s2">is a lot of quote unquote relational</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.980" end="00:26:42.620" style="s2">difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.090" end="00:26:46.110" style="s2">because you know that that that that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.620" end="00:26:47.999" style="s2">where that difficulty is is where the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.110" end="00:26:49.860" style="s2">insight is going to come from you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.999" end="00:26:52.379" style="s2">you actually start like you said you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.860" end="00:26:54.870" style="s2">actually start to understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.379" end="00:26:57.120" style="s2">difficult areas are the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.870" end="00:27:00.990" style="s2">really interesting you get curious about</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.120" end="00:27:04.049" style="s2">what seems like discomfort to the naive</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.990" end="00:27:05.909" style="s2">person seems like oh there&#39;s were dares</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.049" end="00:27:09.049" style="s2">where we need to go you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.909" end="00:27:11.519" style="s2">what&#39;s really curious and in your home</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.049" end="00:27:16.999" style="s2">orientation toward the work starts to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.519" end="00:27:20.730" style="s2">shift well probably both of us know some</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.999" end="00:27:23.369" style="s2">friends and colleagues who seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.730" end="00:27:26.669" style="s2">troublemakers who actually would stir up</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.369" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">some kind of challenging conversations</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.669" end="00:27:32.570" style="s2">or push buttons as it work because look</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:36.330" style="s2">because they are just thrive on</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.570" end="00:27:40.850" style="s2">button-pushing as far as I understand at</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.330" end="00:27:40.850" style="s2">least some people that both of us now we</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.879" end="00:27:47.580" style="s2">have a few friends like this and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.029" end="00:27:50.369" style="s2">actually do this because they realized</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.580" end="00:27:54.179" style="s2">that when the button gets pushed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.369" end="00:27:56.759" style="s2">when the real juicy insights happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.179" end="00:27:59.190" style="s2">that&#39;s when the real new levels of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.759" end="00:28:02.580" style="s2">understanding and the personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.190" end="00:28:04.919" style="s2">development occur that&#39;s when we are</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.580" end="00:28:07.110" style="s2">sitting comfortably in our comfort zone</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.919" end="00:28:09.539" style="s2">but actually when we are operating on</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.110" end="00:28:11.490" style="s2">the edge of the comfort zone but of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.539" end="00:28:13.830" style="s2">course that&#39;s also crucial not to push</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.490" end="00:28:15.749" style="s2">over the edge because then you will push</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.830" end="00:28:18.419" style="s2">people into the zone of discomfort and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.749" end="00:28:20.970" style="s2">pain where they&#39;re going to be freaking</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.419" end="00:28:23.340" style="s2">out or or suffering so nobody is going</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.970" end="00:28:27.119" style="s2">to be grateful for that right right I</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.340" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">mean you don&#39;t want to do it so so push</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.119" end="00:28:33.210" style="s2">that they become over reactive or</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:36.029" style="s2">overwhelmed or overwhelmed I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.210" end="00:28:38.549" style="s2">sometimes people really you know are</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.029" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">dealing was right at the edge of insight</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.549" end="00:28:44.249" style="s2">sometimes a lot of significant trauma</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:47.369" style="s2">comes up and and and that can be more</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.249" end="00:28:49.409" style="s2">difficult to deal with but but yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.369" end="00:28:52.530" style="s2">know and there&#39;s there&#39;s people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.409" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">button pushers who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.530" end="00:28:58.380" style="s2">not that genuine in the sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:02.100" style="s2">themselves are reactive you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.380" end="00:29:07.680" style="s2">can be kind of crazy territory to be in</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.100" end="00:29:13.410" style="s2">but that may be just sheer abuse but</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.680" end="00:29:15.420" style="s2">there is the aspect of you know in and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.410" end="00:29:18.330" style="s2">think the most important thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.420" end="00:29:20.520" style="s2">that when groups get together and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.330" end="00:29:22.470" style="s2">they&#39;re unwilling to work through that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.520" end="00:29:25.470" style="s2">territory then they&#39;re not creative you</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.470" end="00:29:27.720" style="s2">know they settle for compromise or the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.470" end="00:29:29.880" style="s2">person that&#39;s most aggressive everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.720" end="00:29:32.970" style="s2">just is okay well we&#39;ll just do that or</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.880" end="00:29:36.390" style="s2">you know they they they work out a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.970" end="00:29:39.420" style="s2">solution that carries every agreement</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.390" end="00:29:40.800" style="s2">but the reason why everyone is agreeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.420" end="00:29:44.310" style="s2">about it is because it&#39;s not really that</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.800" end="00:29:46.620" style="s2">interesting and people walk away feeling</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.310" end="00:29:49.620" style="s2">frustrated although they hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.620" end="00:29:53.820" style="s2">expressed that in the group itself and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.620" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">so to be able to and to be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.820" end="00:30:02.550" style="s2">there requires both a skill in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:05.370" style="s2">understanding what like what you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.550" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">said what insight is and it also</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.370" end="00:30:12.360" style="s2">requires the ability to remain grounded</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:15.450" style="s2">you know so you&#39;re not running from fear</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.360" end="00:30:17.100" style="s2">of being overly aggressive or feeling</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.450" end="00:30:20.100" style="s2">attacked all the time you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.100" end="00:30:22.140" style="s2">you have to be able to really slow with</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.100" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">the relational dynamic as I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.140" end="00:30:26.850" style="s2">require actual skill and being</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:30.450" style="s2">responsive is that are reactive and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.850" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">probably it has to be somebody at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.450" end="00:30:35.370" style="s2">one person in the group who would</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">provide the role model of responsiveness</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.370" end="00:30:41.970" style="s2">rather than reactivity and fight a</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:45.480" style="s2">flight right yeah one or more than one</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.970" end="00:30:47.790" style="s2">the more the merrier the more than that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.480" end="00:30:52.530" style="s2">Mary you know it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.790" end="00:30:56.100" style="s2">this group I have coming in November all</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.530" end="00:30:59.730" style="s2">of us have been practicing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.100" end="00:31:01.770" style="s2">work with with groups ourselves but all</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.730" end="00:31:06.300" style="s2">of us have different concepts of what</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.770" end="00:31:09.570" style="s2">this work actually is so it will</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.300" end="00:31:13.170" style="s2">be it&#39;ll be a surprise to see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.570" end="00:31:15.090" style="s2">now come together you know as the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.170" end="00:31:17.010" style="s2">who spend all their time facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.090" end="00:31:21.050" style="s2">groups if we can come together as peers</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.010" end="00:31:23.940" style="s2">and do to work again with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.050" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">answer some questions yeah have some</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.940" end="00:31:30.150" style="s2">insight you know so you can always keep</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:32.730" style="s2">upping the ante you know you have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.150" end="00:31:34.350" style="s2">bunch of Qigong masters or who are</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.730" end="00:31:36.150" style="s2">really good now at teaching their</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.350" end="00:31:39.330" style="s2">students and now you have all the Qigong</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.150" end="00:31:42.500" style="s2">masters come and teach each other right</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.330" end="00:31:45.150" style="s2">so you&#39;ve kind of Runyan they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.500" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">well that&#39;s exactly what I did when I</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.150" end="00:31:49.410" style="s2">created the first as far as I know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:52.350" style="s2">first in the history of Qi going on</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.410" end="00:31:55.950" style="s2">history of human time she long</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.350" end="00:31:58.530" style="s2">mastermind group yeah when basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.950" end="00:32:00.450" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what we did together a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.530" end="00:32:03.050" style="s2">number of high-level Qigong</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.450" end="00:32:05.970" style="s2">practitioners and professionals and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.050" end="00:32:10.620" style="s2">literally just created this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.970" end="00:32:12.780" style="s2">cold rod amazing coalition of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.620" end="00:32:14.670" style="s2">coming not just from one country but</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.780" end="00:32:17.660" style="s2">actually from three different countries</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.670" end="00:32:20.820" style="s2">from three different continents and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.660" end="00:32:24.210" style="s2">integrating the different ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.820" end="00:32:27.380" style="s2">approaches in a way that we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.210" end="00:32:30.750" style="s2">trying to just solve that one problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.380" end="00:32:33.630" style="s2">and all agreeing to how its salt but</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.750" end="00:32:36.180" style="s2">actually help each other step up to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.630" end="00:32:38.790" style="s2">next level of mastery and the next level</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.180" end="00:32:42.270" style="s2">and successfulness as Qigong</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.790" end="00:32:45.090" style="s2">professionals so there has to be some</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.270" end="00:32:48.030" style="s2">high level motivation for people to</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.090" end="00:32:51.960" style="s2">engage in this type of insight seeking</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.030" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">process because if they don&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.960" end="00:32:58.170" style="s2">the benefits of getting the insight are</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:33:01.920" style="s2">going to be great enough to offset the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.170" end="00:33:03.930" style="s2">pain or the just struggle of actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.920" end="00:33:06.750" style="s2">getting there then they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.930" end="00:33:08.660" style="s2">motivated enough to get involved right</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.750" end="00:33:11.880" style="s2">or they will just run away</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.660" end="00:33:16.230" style="s2">exactly I think the motivation for this</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.880" end="00:33:18.870" style="s2">group is the world for the motivation</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.230" end="00:33:19.660" style="s2">for me is that you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.870" end="00:33:24.040" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.660" end="00:33:29.010" style="s2">uh we are faced with in our modern world</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.040" end="00:33:31.470" style="s2">is that a lot of the big situaion</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.010" end="00:33:34.920" style="s2">situations were in require</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.470" end="00:33:38.770" style="s2">collaborations or a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.920" end="00:33:41.730" style="s2">projects need a physicist and an</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.770" end="00:33:43.870" style="s2">ambassador and a politician and a</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.730" end="00:33:50.290" style="s2">sociologist you know we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.870" end="00:33:52.930" style="s2">very large complex issues and it is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.290" end="00:33:55.270" style="s2">often if we look at our quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.930" end="00:33:59.710" style="s2">leaders these people come together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.270" end="00:34:03.450" style="s2">they they don&#39;t have highly you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.710" end="00:34:06.010" style="s2">functional conversations right so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.450" end="00:34:07.900" style="s2">just one of the things that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.010" end="00:34:10.270" style="s2">about this work is whether or not we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.900" end="00:34:14.470" style="s2">derive principles just like principles</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.270" end="00:34:18.700" style="s2">of practices and Qigong that can create</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.470" end="00:34:20.980" style="s2">greater capacity in people for working</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.700" end="00:34:23.320" style="s2">in a different way so people are looking</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.980" end="00:34:25.419" style="s2">for compromise or consensus but to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.320" end="00:34:27.790" style="s2">actually understand that they can come</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.419" end="00:34:30.700" style="s2">together from all these diverse</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.790" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">backgrounds and do a different process</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.700" end="00:34:37.950" style="s2">well let me clarify or maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:42.040" style="s2">clarify it for us what is it that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.950" end="00:34:46.870" style="s2">participants in the symposium hoping or</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.040" end="00:34:48.429" style="s2">aspiring to realize as a benefit that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.870" end="00:34:53.260" style="s2">would come as a result of participating</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.429" end="00:34:54.640" style="s2">in this oppose it well I think that one</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.260" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">of the first things we&#39;re going to do in</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.640" end="00:34:59.890" style="s2">the first day is everyone&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:02.290" style="s2">articulate what they&#39;re in you know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.890" end="00:35:05.650" style="s2">they&#39;ve come with what expectation what</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.290" end="00:35:07.330" style="s2">part of their work is at the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.650" end="00:35:10.360" style="s2">their own knowing where do they want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.330" end="00:35:14.050" style="s2">move their work so that will give us an</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.360" end="00:35:17.140" style="s2">idea of the range of intentions that</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.050" end="00:35:19.750" style="s2">people will have and from that we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.140" end="00:35:24.580" style="s2">going to we will try to collectively</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.750" end="00:35:26.740" style="s2">figure out what what the edge of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.580" end="00:35:29.740" style="s2">collective work is you know what is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.740" end="00:35:32.920" style="s2">is the common principle or common is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.740" end="00:35:35.500" style="s2">a good words we will find out</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.920" end="00:35:37.270" style="s2">what the significant you know why is</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.500" end="00:35:39.460" style="s2">this a significant passing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.270" end="00:35:41.920" style="s2">people all over the world doing this</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.460" end="00:35:43.480" style="s2">practice in many different ways and from</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.920" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">spiritual communities that have been</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.480" end="00:35:48.420" style="s2">together for 14 or 15 years so women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:52.150" style="s2">groups that have been together for years</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.420" end="00:35:54.250" style="s2">a woman that has worked with the shamans</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.150" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">in South America represents that type of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.250" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">tradition so we all I think what we all</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">would have will have already have our</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:09.730" style="s2">unique intention and we wanted we want</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.880" end="00:36:13.000" style="s2">to use the practice to say why is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.730" end="00:36:15.400" style="s2">work emerging right now what is its</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.000" end="00:36:17.820" style="s2">capacity how can we get together and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.400" end="00:36:20.920" style="s2">like you said with your group and really</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.820" end="00:36:24.190" style="s2">push ourselves individually and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.920" end="00:36:25.390" style="s2">collectively to the next the next step</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.190" end="00:36:27.730" style="s2">the next phase</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.390" end="00:36:29.980" style="s2">I&#39;d like to brought in I&#39;d like to bring</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.730" end="00:36:32.290" style="s2">the work into much broader community so</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.980" end="00:36:35.230" style="s2">right now there&#39;s a lot of small</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.290" end="00:36:38.080" style="s2">community practices that are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.230" end="00:36:42.940" style="s2">work I&#39;d like to bring it into a much</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.080" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">larger community so let me ask you what</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.940" end="00:36:48.940" style="s2">would be your vision of where you would</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:53.890" style="s2">like to see this work taking you</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.940" end="00:36:56.140" style="s2">personally in the next year if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.890" end="00:36:59.710" style="s2">getting the benefits that you aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.140" end="00:37:03.220" style="s2">gain from this symposium and similar I</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.710" end="00:37:06.580" style="s2">would love to like I have it I have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.220" end="00:37:09.640" style="s2">really clear vision of children in</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.580" end="00:37:12.220" style="s2">school learning through collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.640" end="00:37:15.270" style="s2">insight practice I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.220" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">things is we see that that machine</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.270" end="00:37:19.450" style="s2">handle most of the information and most</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:22.360" style="s2">of our knowledge we don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.450" end="00:37:25.750" style="s2">teaching people content but but if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.360" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">know if children have the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.750" end="00:37:30.100" style="s2">learning through collective insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:32.920" style="s2">practice helping each other learn and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.100" end="00:37:35.110" style="s2">being playful and spontaneous and coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.920" end="00:37:37.810" style="s2">up with new ideas and creative</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.110" end="00:37:40.840" style="s2">imaginaries and reinventing their</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.810" end="00:37:44.020" style="s2">futures from early on you know I can see</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.840" end="00:37:45.180" style="s2">this practice as starting very early I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.020" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">can see</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.180" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">judicial systems and Parliament&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:54.609" style="s2">instead of working in an adversarial way</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:58.119" style="s2">coming together in adjudicating human</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.609" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">human problems and concerns through</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.119" end="00:38:01.329" style="s2">collective insight so you have your</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:03.519" style="s2">defendant your plaintiff and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.329" end="00:38:05.769" style="s2">families and the JIT and their</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.519" end="00:38:07.450" style="s2">facilitators and the judges doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.769" end="00:38:10.539" style="s2">collective insight around a problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.450" end="00:38:13.329" style="s2">instead of this crazy adversarial system</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.539" end="00:38:17.500" style="s2">we have you know I can see the practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.329" end="00:38:20.740" style="s2">in forming any kind of engagement where</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.500" end="00:38:24.509" style="s2">people have to work with each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.740" end="00:38:27.670" style="s2">collaborative way so my primary</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.509" end="00:38:31.869" style="s2">enthusiasm is for education wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.670" end="00:38:34.750" style="s2">but I can see it happening and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.869" end="00:38:37.299" style="s2">the problem with with with older people</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.750" end="00:38:39.490" style="s2">is that were already so stuck in our old</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.299" end="00:38:41.259" style="s2">ways you know so if we can if we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.490" end="00:38:43.420" style="s2">bring it into younger and younger</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.259" end="00:38:46.569" style="s2">situations for the younger people</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.420" end="00:38:48.670" style="s2">then people will just know how to relate</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.569" end="00:38:51.519" style="s2">to each other in that kind of a form you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.670" end="00:38:53.259" style="s2">know what what do we get I mean I got</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.519" end="00:38:55.210" style="s2">taught you go to you go to college and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.259" end="00:38:57.549" style="s2">you get taught how to debate and how to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.210" end="00:39:00.250" style="s2">be competitive debaters you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.549" end="00:39:02.170" style="s2">that has its function but it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.250" end="00:39:05.109" style="s2">creative as working in a more</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.170" end="00:39:08.430" style="s2">collaborative way so you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.109" end="00:39:11.589" style="s2">convince people instead of integrating</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.430" end="00:39:15.480" style="s2">your insight with their insight and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.589" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">perhaps coming up with a unified</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.480" end="00:39:22.210" style="s2">integral view of reality exactly which</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">includes more of reality I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.210" end="00:39:28.329" style="s2">think about it we&#39;re we&#39;re taught from</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:31.509" style="s2">very early on that when people have two</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.329" end="00:39:33.849" style="s2">answers to the question one is right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.509" end="00:39:36.130" style="s2">one is wrong right this this is how</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.849" end="00:39:38.710" style="s2">we&#39;re taught from grade one and great</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.130" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">you know all the way through and and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.710" end="00:39:45.160" style="s2">problem with one answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:49.569" style="s2">is that it includes less of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.160" end="00:39:51.279" style="s2">so if you if you to over simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.569" end="00:39:53.140" style="s2">thing because there are right answers</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.279" end="00:39:56.289" style="s2">and wrong answers in certain contexts</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.140" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">but if you if you understood the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.289" end="00:40:00.730" style="s2">complexity of the wrong answer of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:02.609" style="s2">context of the wrong answer and those</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.730" end="00:40:04.990" style="s2">two kids worked with each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.609" end="00:40:06.820" style="s2">collectively and collaboratively than</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.990" end="00:40:09.280" style="s2">they would both learn something more</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.820" end="00:40:11.710" style="s2">than they had learned before and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:16.109" style="s2">would learn a way to be together that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.710" end="00:40:19.090" style="s2">think is really beneficial for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.109" end="00:40:21.400" style="s2">wonderful well I&#39;m sure that some of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.090" end="00:40:25.900" style="s2">listeners would love to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.220" end="00:41:03.820" style="s2">now this is certainly a good question</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.380" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">why did you decide to do crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.820" end="00:41:09.070" style="s2">what is it for and why is there supposed</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:11.800" style="s2">to be any kind of crowdfunding for this</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.070" end="00:41:14.140" style="s2">effort of it that&#39;s a good question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.800" end="00:41:17.650" style="s2">the first time that I&#39;ve tried and used</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.140" end="00:41:20.680" style="s2">this model for raising funds and part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.650" end="00:41:24.310" style="s2">the reason why I did it was because I</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.680" end="00:41:27.460" style="s2">was curious about the process and wanted</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.310" end="00:41:30.070" style="s2">to answer some questions about what</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.460" end="00:41:32.680" style="s2">groups of people would be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.070" end="00:41:34.690" style="s2">this kind of work I&#39;m not charging the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.680" end="00:41:36.910" style="s2">participants who are coming from all</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.690" end="00:41:40.810" style="s2">around the world they they&#39;re donating</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.910" end="00:41:44.230" style="s2">their time and their travel expenses but</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.810" end="00:41:47.080" style="s2">I do have expenses to full room and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.230" end="00:41:49.570" style="s2">board here and supplies and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.080" end="00:41:54.310" style="s2">going to do live-streaming and some</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.570" end="00:41:57.010" style="s2">video taping so I was hoping to raise</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.310" end="00:41:59.290" style="s2">enough money to offset those costs but</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.010" end="00:42:02.590" style="s2">also then to raise money so that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.290" end="00:42:06.369" style="s2">could do some post-production materials</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.590" end="00:42:08.380" style="s2">like a handbook and some workshops and</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.369" end="00:42:08.970" style="s2">presentations that we could take out to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.380" end="00:42:11.250" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.970" end="00:42:13.829" style="s2">brought a community and start to really</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.250" end="00:42:16.650" style="s2">create a community of practice so at</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.829" end="00:42:19.470" style="s2">different levels of support we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.650" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">able to do more work after the symposium</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.470" end="00:42:29.400" style="s2">Oh wonderful I&#39;m actually visiting your</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:34.440" style="s2">IndieGoGo campaign web page and it says</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.400" end="00:42:38.579" style="s2">that you had a goal of $22,000 and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.440" end="00:42:40.589" style="s2">have collected almost 20 grand so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.579" end="00:42:43.500" style="s2">only three thousand and four hundred</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.589" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">dollars away from your goal with ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.500" end="00:42:47.430" style="s2">days actually it&#39;s the opposite I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:48.839" style="s2">only collected three thousand four</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.430" end="00:42:51.480" style="s2">hundred and ten dollars so it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.839" end="00:42:53.660" style="s2">very good well yeah it&#39;s been very very</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.480" end="00:42:57.900" style="s2">slow so um</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.660" end="00:43:02.430" style="s2">okay well so then perhaps we need some</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.900" end="00:43:03.560" style="s2">insight as to how to make this campaign</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.430" end="00:43:08.670" style="s2">more successful</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.560" end="00:43:12.450" style="s2">exactly perhaps so if somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.670" end="00:43:15.450" style="s2">listening to us right now has an idea or</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.450" end="00:43:18.270" style="s2">question or insight about how to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.450" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">this crowdfunding campaign even more</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.270" end="00:43:22.589" style="s2">successful you are welcome to call it</p>

<p begin="00:43:40.800" end="00:43:47.790" style="s2">involvement with integral philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.950" end="00:43:49.849" style="s2">whole community I&#39;m sure that some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.790" end="00:43:53.010" style="s2">our listeners that would need to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.849" end="00:43:55.800" style="s2">brought up to speed about what this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.010" end="00:43:59.700" style="s2">whole integral things about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.800" end="00:44:04.230" style="s2">community is pretty broadly defined so</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.700" end="00:44:09.060" style="s2">we share some common interests</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.230" end="00:44:11.640" style="s2">and we also disagree on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.060" end="00:44:15.930" style="s2">different fine points but basically the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.640" end="00:44:22.910" style="s2">integral community is a community that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.930" end="00:44:22.910" style="s2">is practicing a level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.450" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">understanding that is called post</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.130" end="00:44:33.300" style="s2">conventional so that we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:36.540" style="s2">for example aware of many different</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.300" end="00:44:38.760" style="s2">perspectives and that they can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.540" end="00:44:41.780" style="s2">integrated in we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.760" end="00:44:45.600" style="s2">we&#39;re aware of multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.780" end="00:44:49.380" style="s2">thinking different at ways of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.600" end="00:44:53.190" style="s2">time different spatial our perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.380" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">were aware that the human condition is</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.190" end="00:45:00.330" style="s2">an evolutionary trajectory so what was</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:04.200" style="s2">true you know a hundred years ago is</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.330" end="00:45:07.650" style="s2">just a limiting a limited view of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.200" end="00:45:09.480" style="s2">we understand today so that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.650" end="00:45:12.270" style="s2">this understanding about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.480" end="00:45:15.030" style="s2">evolutionary trajectory of the human</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.270" end="00:45:17.790" style="s2">condition to really be curious about</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.030" end="00:45:20.460" style="s2">where can we go next the integral</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.790" end="00:45:23.880" style="s2">community is interested in integrating</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.460" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">body mind and spirit so that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.880" end="00:45:30.470" style="s2">chop up our experience as something</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.359" end="00:45:33.510" style="s2">that&#39;s either mental or embodied or</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.470" end="00:45:36.270" style="s2">spiritual pursue or you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.510" end="00:45:39.560" style="s2">science versus religion and so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.270" end="00:45:42.859" style="s2">the philosophy is geared toward</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.560" end="00:45:45.540" style="s2">articulating a more holistic view of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.859" end="00:45:49.230" style="s2">reality so we would call it more</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.540" end="00:45:52.230" style="s2">integral or integrated view well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.230" end="00:45:56.250" style="s2">interesting what you just said that what</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.230" end="00:45:59.250" style="s2">used to be acceptable and to be right on</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.250" end="00:46:03.270" style="s2">the money hundred years ago appears to</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.250" end="00:46:06.390" style="s2">no longer cut the mustard now why is it</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.270" end="00:46:11.690" style="s2">specifically to science and perhaps to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.390" end="00:46:15.080" style="s2">some other social sciences and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.690" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">understanding of things but how about</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.080" end="00:46:21.660" style="s2">some traditional schools of thought for</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:24.630" style="s2">example we can talk about religion or we</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.660" end="00:46:28.290" style="s2">can talk about Qigong schools and styles</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.630" end="00:46:30.930" style="s2">or how do you relate or how do you deal</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.290" end="00:46:34.920" style="s2">with the notion that perhaps there are</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.930" end="00:46:36.539" style="s2">some cools of thought that despite the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.920" end="00:46:40.339" style="s2">fact that they&#39;re pretty old</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.539" end="00:46:44.699" style="s2">they actually have a greater grasp on</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.339" end="00:46:48.029" style="s2">the true nature of reality then the more</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.699" end="00:46:52.529" style="s2">modern schools that emerged maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.029" end="00:46:55.469" style="s2">in the last few hundreds of years was</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.529" end="00:46:59.640" style="s2">that it yeah this is something that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.469" end="00:47:03.449" style="s2">don&#39;t all agree on I tend to be a much</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.640" end="00:47:05.789" style="s2">much more inclined to think that even</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.449" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">some core spiritual understanding</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.789" end="00:47:09.989" style="s2">evolved and that they you know in in</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:13.199" style="s2">many cases they&#39;re in desperate need of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.989" end="00:47:16.589" style="s2">an and upgrade and I think what you if</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.199" end="00:47:18.479" style="s2">you look closely someone like I would</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.589" end="00:47:22.259" style="s2">say someone like yourself who is</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.479" end="00:47:25.140" style="s2">actually can follow perhaps your core</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.259" end="00:47:28.199" style="s2">teaching to an old lineage I would say</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.140" end="00:47:30.689" style="s2">that even still that you&#39;ve made quite a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.199" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">lot of updates upgrades to the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.689" end="00:47:37.079" style="s2">presented or the way it makes itself out</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:39.059" style="s2">into the world or the kinds of practices</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.079" end="00:47:41.939" style="s2">that you incorporate with your school</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.059" end="00:47:45.059" style="s2">you know I think it&#39;s that it may be in</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.939" end="00:47:47.759" style="s2">some sense the same core teaching but it</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.059" end="00:47:50.729" style="s2">certainly has been expanded into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.759" end="00:47:53.549" style="s2">modern world and I would argue that it</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.549" end="00:47:59.519" style="s2">a minute than it did in its in its past</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.130" end="00:48:01.979" style="s2">form I think we hang on to some of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.519" end="00:48:05.699" style="s2">traditions way longer than we should and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.979" end="00:48:07.799" style="s2">I think that we actually it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.699" end="00:48:10.679" style="s2">like we remember the past as being</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.799" end="00:48:14.009" style="s2">better than than it actually was in self</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.679" end="00:48:16.709" style="s2">exam pillai been working a lot with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.009" end="00:48:20.219" style="s2">anthropological roots of animism and</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.709" end="00:48:23.939" style="s2">shamanism and really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.219" end="00:48:27.179" style="s2">understand what early what what what</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.939" end="00:48:29.729" style="s2">these early man was like what early</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.179" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">humans were like and and you really get</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.729" end="00:48:35.369" style="s2">a different picture then the narratives</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:38.429" style="s2">that sometimes you hear about some of</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.369" end="00:48:39.869" style="s2">these early practices well for example</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.429" end="00:48:42.239" style="s2">people what if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.869" end="00:48:44.429" style="s2">collective insight some people mistake</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.239" end="00:48:47.059" style="s2">some of this work for what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.429" end="00:48:49.679" style="s2">is not a modern version and that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.059" end="00:48:52.709" style="s2">people will say well people used to sit</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.679" end="00:48:55.429" style="s2">in circle and understood themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.709" end="00:48:58.380" style="s2">one people but they didn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.429" end="00:49:01.169" style="s2">the experience of being singular</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.380" end="00:49:03.419" style="s2">individuals so that was a different type</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.169" end="00:49:05.549" style="s2">of collective because there was no</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.419" end="00:49:07.949" style="s2">diversity you know so that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.549" end="00:49:10.709" style="s2">like we have so much more diversity now</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.949" end="00:49:12.929" style="s2">that that doing collective insight has a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.709" end="00:49:16.799" style="s2">lot more challenging and it includes</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.929" end="00:49:19.409" style="s2">more of reality and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.799" end="00:49:21.689" style="s2">tendency to think oh we just have to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.409" end="00:49:23.939" style="s2">like early man was when everybody got</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.689" end="00:49:26.369" style="s2">along or you know the tribe sat around</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.939" end="00:49:28.799" style="s2">and they were all thought of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.369" end="00:49:30.449" style="s2">as one people but that was a totally</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.799" end="00:49:33.059" style="s2">different situation well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.449" end="00:49:37.259" style="s2">interesting that even in Taoism for</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.059" end="00:49:40.699" style="s2">example in daodejing and other canonical</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.259" end="00:49:46.489" style="s2">books of dollars there are numerous</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.699" end="00:49:50.789" style="s2">references to the sages of the old date</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.489" end="00:49:54.119" style="s2">when apparently the men of all the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.789" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">wiser somehow more in tune with nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.119" end="00:49:58.979" style="s2">and even back 2500 years ago when those</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:02.359" style="s2">who purportedly</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.979" end="00:50:06.029" style="s2">wrote thousands inc they were lamenting</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.359" end="00:50:08.549" style="s2">that and nowadays things are not sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.029" end="00:50:10.469" style="s2">smooth and we&#39;re no longer in harmony so</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.549" end="00:50:12.509" style="s2">in other words the paradise is lost</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.469" end="00:50:16.799" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer living in the Golden</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.509" end="00:50:19.709" style="s2">Age this type of thing well for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.799" end="00:50:22.859" style="s2">here is a mistake that people make when</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.709" end="00:50:25.319" style="s2">the anthropologist first studied the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.859" end="00:50:27.569" style="s2">early totemic peoples in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.319" end="00:50:30.659" style="s2">indigenous tribes that are still based</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.569" end="00:50:33.209" style="s2">on totemism today they were confused</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.659" end="00:50:35.489" style="s2">because the totemic people would say</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.209" end="00:50:37.890" style="s2">well this animal is a person&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.489" end="00:50:41.039" style="s2">our tribe and this plant is a they call</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.890" end="00:50:43.829" style="s2">them persons part of our tribe and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.039" end="00:50:46.769" style="s2">this this stone or this rock or this</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.829" end="00:50:49.529" style="s2">landscape is a person also so they</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.769" end="00:50:52.009" style="s2">started to think of animism is that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.529" end="00:50:55.140" style="s2">ability to think of everything as being</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.009" end="00:50:57.719" style="s2">animated which is I think a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.140" end="00:51:00.190" style="s2">thing right to have this concept of all</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.719" end="00:51:03.069" style="s2">of creation being actually alive and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.190" end="00:51:06.640" style="s2">animated but what was happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.069" end="00:51:09.430" style="s2">totemic societies was yes this plant was</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:12.819" style="s2">a person and this animal was a person</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.430" end="00:51:16.270" style="s2">but not that plant and not that animal</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.819" end="00:51:19.869" style="s2">and only some people humans were persons</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.270" end="00:51:24.130" style="s2">and not those humans so it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.869" end="00:51:26.349" style="s2">more exclusive than inclusive okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.130" end="00:51:28.750" style="s2">just that they included some plants some</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.349" end="00:51:32.530" style="s2">animals and some humans and not others</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.750" end="00:51:35.109" style="s2">and we actually interesting I found</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.530" end="00:51:41.319" style="s2">another apologist by training myself so</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.109" end="00:51:44.800" style="s2">I&#39;m curious as to which Satanic nations</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.319" end="00:51:47.170" style="s2">or tribes you&#39;re referring to so for</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.800" end="00:51:50.589" style="s2">example did they not have the attitude</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.170" end="00:51:53.950" style="s2">of the rock people or the four-legged</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.589" end="00:51:59.410" style="s2">people or the wing people in other words</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.950" end="00:52:03.069" style="s2">birds or four-legged creatures who would</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.410" end="00:52:05.800" style="s2">basically be referred to as people in</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.069" end="00:52:08.440" style="s2">general rather than this is one bird</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.800" end="00:52:11.560" style="s2">that I relate to as the person but no</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.440" end="00:52:15.579" style="s2">other birds are included in this type of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.560" end="00:52:19.480" style="s2">relationship well they did they did</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.579" end="00:52:21.970" style="s2">understand that from if you were another</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.480" end="00:52:24.760" style="s2">people that those people are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.970" end="00:52:27.700" style="s2">you as not persons you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.760" end="00:52:29.980" style="s2">person so what&#39;s a person if you had</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.700" end="00:52:35.140" style="s2">personhood you could not be eaten right</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.980" end="00:52:36.849" style="s2">so those could be the rabbit people but</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.140" end="00:52:39.700" style="s2">they weren&#39;t persons because you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.849" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">eat them and and and there were other</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.700" end="00:52:44.859" style="s2">humans that this particular tribe would</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:47.369" style="s2">understand that they had their own kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.859" end="00:52:50.710" style="s2">of clan but they were not given</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.369" end="00:52:53.650" style="s2">personhood a personhood all it all had</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.710" end="00:52:56.230" style="s2">to do about with who you you know who</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.650" end="00:52:58.380" style="s2">and what you could eat versus what who</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.230" end="00:53:00.839" style="s2">is on top of the food chain</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.380" end="00:53:03.849" style="s2">really and you know we have that</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.839" end="00:53:06.160" style="s2">culturally we have that still in our in</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.849" end="00:53:08.530" style="s2">our cultural taboos today you know some</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:10.569" style="s2">people eat horse and some people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.530" end="00:53:12.320" style="s2">some people eat dogs and some cultures</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.569" end="00:53:15.650" style="s2">don&#39;t we still have that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.320" end="00:53:20.530" style="s2">kind of inclusivity and exclusivity in</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.650" end="00:53:23.000" style="s2">our cultural taboos today of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.530" end="00:53:25.700" style="s2">relatively simplistic understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.000" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">personhood then we definitely need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.700" end="00:53:33.230" style="s2">regard bears and cougars as persons a</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:35.570" style="s2">lot more than say horses right because</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.230" end="00:53:39.410" style="s2">well they&#39;re but seriously on on top of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.570" end="00:53:41.450" style="s2">the food chain so they can eat oh can</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.410" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">you force us on pretty much anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.450" end="00:53:47.210" style="s2">yeah little are the different totally</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:51.890" style="s2">totemic tribes they they categorized it</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.210" end="00:53:57.140" style="s2">these beings in different ways you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.890" end="00:53:59.600" style="s2">depending upon how they were evolving so</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.140" end="00:54:01.990" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re talking about this because</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.600" end="00:54:07.820" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.990" end="00:54:10.730" style="s2">popular story is that way back when we</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.820" end="00:54:12.800" style="s2">were all very in tune with nature and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.730" end="00:54:16.130" style="s2">with the animals and much more</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.800" end="00:54:19.250" style="s2">respectful it and that&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.130" end="00:54:22.520" style="s2">the real story of the whole story I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.250" end="00:54:24.560" style="s2">I think that I think that it needs an</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.520" end="00:54:26.780" style="s2">upgrade and you could argue that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.560" end="00:54:29.420" style="s2">actually starting to include well we</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.780" end="00:54:31.670" style="s2">certainly include more of all the humans</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.420" end="00:54:35.060" style="s2">now almost every culture will include</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.670" end="00:54:37.190" style="s2">all humans as persons and some some</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.060" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">cultures are starting to include certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.190" end="00:54:41.990" style="s2">animals to give them certain rights and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:44.210" style="s2">and I think that that you could argue</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.990" end="00:54:46.580" style="s2">that we&#39;re actually moving in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.210" end="00:54:48.890" style="s2">direction toward which we think we were</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.580" end="00:54:52.280" style="s2">in the past you know it were actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.890" end="00:54:55.460" style="s2">not completed those steps yet I know he</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.280" end="00:54:58.730" style="s2">talks about the old sages and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.460" end="00:55:00.830" style="s2">sure if that&#39;s metaphorical or not well</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.730" end="00:55:03.500" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.830" end="00:55:05.720" style="s2">degree of metaphor in there because when</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.500" end="00:55:08.000" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about some things that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.720" end="00:55:12.230" style="s2">happened in the past and greater harmony</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:14.570" style="s2">with nature well it was easier to be in</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.230" end="00:55:17.810" style="s2">harmony with nature because well for one</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.570" end="00:55:20.570" style="s2">there were fewer people and Earth&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.810" end="00:55:25.130" style="s2">there was just less artificial landscape</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.570" end="00:55:26.060" style="s2">it was less the urban build-up there was</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.130" end="00:55:30.020" style="s2">less and</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.060" end="00:55:31.970" style="s2">structure and pollution even back then</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.020" end="00:55:33.770" style="s2">China probably was relatively more</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.970" end="00:55:36.380" style="s2">polluted than any other place on earth</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.770" end="00:55:38.000" style="s2">and of course now it is the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.380" end="00:55:41.090" style="s2">polluted place on earth as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.000" end="00:55:44.270" style="s2">concerned is all thanks to just the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.090" end="00:55:47.900" style="s2">sheer number of people and of course if</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.270" end="00:55:50.120" style="s2">we look at how back you know thousands</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.900" end="00:55:53.180" style="s2">or several thousand years it was less</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.120" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">pollution and organization well it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.180" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">easier to be in harmony with nature how</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:56:02.120" style="s2">you were functioning in that harmony</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:04.580" style="s2">that&#39;s a different story yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.120" end="00:56:08.000" style="s2">uh one of the things that I would say</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.580" end="00:56:11.540" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m not sure this is really</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:13.270" style="s2">what Lao Tzu was talking about but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.540" end="00:56:17.480" style="s2">like to make the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.270" end="00:56:20.050" style="s2">culture I think that culture as we know</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.480" end="00:56:24.190" style="s2">it you know in terms of if you identify</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.050" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">as Chinese or if you identify as</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.190" end="00:56:29.930" style="s2">American or if you identities little</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:32.600" style="s2">these little identifications I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.930" end="00:56:35.390" style="s2">that in general they you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.600" end="00:56:37.700" style="s2">they come with a lot of problems you</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.390" end="00:56:40.120" style="s2">know I mean Western society and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.700" end="00:56:42.770" style="s2">Industrial Revolution all this cultural</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.120" end="00:56:46.640" style="s2">development that has taken us away from</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.770" end="00:56:50.360" style="s2">nature is not necessarily all good and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:53.540" style="s2">would argue that in many cases it&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.360" end="00:56:56.810" style="s2">ranch wrong trajectory and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.540" end="00:56:59.690" style="s2">I make the distinction between working</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.810" end="00:57:01.850" style="s2">as a culture because you kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.690" end="00:57:04.690" style="s2">born into a culture and indoctrinated</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.850" end="00:57:08.210" style="s2">into a culture versus working as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.690" end="00:57:11.330" style="s2">collective which is participatory so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.210" end="00:57:13.430" style="s2">meet you and we all meet at a conference</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.330" end="00:57:15.500" style="s2">and there&#39;s five or six of us we come</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.430" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">from different cultures and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.500" end="00:57:21.980" style="s2">interacting to each other as if we were</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:24.170" style="s2">inside our own cultures we just start</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.980" end="00:57:26.180" style="s2">participating in this really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.170" end="00:57:30.860" style="s2">being present with each other and this</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.180" end="00:57:33.800" style="s2">participatory collective that is outside</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.860" end="00:57:36.470" style="s2">of culture and and I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.800" end="00:57:39.620" style="s2">more like the vision that the early</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.470" end="00:57:42.230" style="s2">sages had they weren&#39;t that thrill</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.620" end="00:57:46.550" style="s2">old with the momentum of you know these</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.230" end="00:57:48.050" style="s2">big cultural and state and Empire organ</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.550" end="00:57:51.290" style="s2">you know kind of organization of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.050" end="00:57:54.590" style="s2">humanity well that requires a certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.290" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">level of individuation nor do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.590" end="00:58:00.620" style="s2">actually have to depart enough from your</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:02.740" style="s2">native culture in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.620" end="00:58:06.730" style="s2">see the relevant there they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.740" end="00:58:10.640" style="s2">relativity of all cultural values and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.730" end="00:58:13.400" style="s2">attachments because if you don&#39;t depart</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.640" end="00:58:16.550" style="s2">enough from the culture you will be too</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.400" end="00:58:21.580" style="s2">engrossed too indoctrinated too much</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.550" end="00:58:23.870" style="s2">under the just programmed robotic</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.580" end="00:58:25.700" style="s2">repetition of certain steps and</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.870" end="00:58:27.320" style="s2">procedures that are standard in your</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.700" end="00:58:30.410" style="s2">culture and then you will know you</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.320" end="00:58:33.560" style="s2">interest you can&#39;t meet me we can&#39;t meet</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.410" end="00:58:37.310" style="s2">each other if if we are defined by these</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.560" end="00:58:39.850" style="s2">programs exactly we will also be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.310" end="00:58:43.550" style="s2">threatened to depart from our</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.850" end="00:58:46.010" style="s2">stereotypical worldviews or standard</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.550" end="00:58:49.870" style="s2">operating procedures that are culturally</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.010" end="00:58:53.210" style="s2">dependent but if we feel like our</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.870" end="00:58:55.640" style="s2">identity is so hinged on our</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.210" end="00:58:57.950" style="s2">participation in the culture that if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.640" end="00:59:02.840" style="s2">quit being members of this culture we</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.950" end="00:59:05.390" style="s2">won&#39;t know who we are anymore exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.840" end="00:59:08.030" style="s2">and and so to me there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.390" end="00:59:10.190" style="s2">culture that is is an obstacle in that</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.030" end="00:59:14.330" style="s2">way and just to tie it back into</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.190" end="00:59:18.170" style="s2">collective insight yeah I use the term</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.330" end="00:59:21.740" style="s2">collective as as it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.170" end="00:59:24.650" style="s2">antidote to culture so culture is an</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.740" end="00:59:27.460" style="s2">indoctrination process you&#39;re born into</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.650" end="00:59:29.570" style="s2">it whereas collective Insider</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.460" end="00:59:31.820" style="s2">participatory collective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.570" end="00:59:34.850" style="s2">spontaneous it&#39;s in the moment you meet</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.820" end="00:59:37.640" style="s2">each other right where you&#39;re at in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.850" end="00:59:40.820" style="s2">very creative kind of way and for me</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.640" end="00:59:42.650" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s transcultural it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.820" end="00:59:44.300" style="s2">transcultural practice and has the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.650" end="00:59:47.840" style="s2">ability to solve some of some of those</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.300" end="00:59:52.940" style="s2">obstacles well this is fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.840" end="00:59:53.539" style="s2">I also imagine that our next mastermind</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.940" end="00:59:56.119" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.539" end="00:59:59.209" style="s2">Chico masters will definitely benefit</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.119" end="01:00:01.609" style="s2">from this type of approach because this</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.209" end="01:00:04.489" style="s2">is essentially why we would do this type</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.609" end="01:00:07.669" style="s2">of gathering on your consistent in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.489" end="01:00:11.479" style="s2">month after month basis and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.669" end="01:00:14.769" style="s2">things that I would imagine is that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.479" end="01:00:17.689" style="s2">would be able to even instigator or be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.769" end="01:00:19.549" style="s2">catalyst for this type of collective</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.689" end="01:00:22.939" style="s2">insight and long</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.549" end="01:00:26.169" style="s2">that young masters yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.939" end="01:00:28.369" style="s2">you&#39;ve already established a really good</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.169" end="01:00:30.469" style="s2">beginning you know it sounds like it has</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.369" end="01:00:33.079" style="s2">momentum and it&#39;s been successful the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.469" end="01:00:35.689" style="s2">question is is how far can we can we</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.079" end="01:00:38.599" style="s2">really intentionally use a different</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.689" end="01:00:40.099" style="s2">kind of capacity to see what might arise</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.599" end="01:00:44.539" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.099" end="01:00:46.969" style="s2">exciting well and if you allow your</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.539" end="01:00:49.969" style="s2">excitement to come to paint a picture of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.969" end="01:00:53.299" style="s2">where this might take us what do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.969" end="01:00:56.389" style="s2">think the world that you go would be in</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.299" end="01:00:59.839" style="s2">just a few years from now if this type</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.389" end="01:01:04.130" style="s2">of a more integral and more collective</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:07.069" style="s2">insightful approach prevailed or has</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.130" end="01:01:10.099" style="s2">become more accepted among to run</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.069" end="01:01:12.559" style="s2">petitioners well I have a big idea there</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.099" end="01:01:15.669" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of a fantasy so I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.559" end="01:01:19.339" style="s2">give it a like that I don&#39;t see I</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.669" end="01:01:22.689" style="s2">actually see a very Taoist at heart and</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.339" end="01:01:26.959" style="s2">I actually see it as realizing some of</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.689" end="01:01:30.139" style="s2">the expectations of the of the DAO</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.959" end="01:01:34.539" style="s2">teaching because I one of the things in</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.139" end="01:01:38.149" style="s2">Taoism and correct me if I&#39;m wrong but</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.539" end="01:01:40.939" style="s2">we have the microcosmic orbit right so</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.149" end="01:01:43.999" style="s2">that which is which is kind of a little</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.939" end="01:01:49.009" style="s2">model of the macrocosmic orbit right the</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.999" end="01:01:52.249" style="s2">way the individuals flow is the same in</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.009" end="01:01:55.159" style="s2">it fractal of the macro cosmic order and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.249" end="01:01:59.179" style="s2">in all spiritual traditions what you see</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.159" end="01:02:01.399" style="s2">is is this kind of pattern you go from</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.179" end="01:02:04.459" style="s2">the individual so like a Buddhist can</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.399" end="01:02:06.450" style="s2">meditate and work on themselves and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.459" end="01:02:09.560" style="s2">he goes from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.450" end="01:02:12.869" style="s2">individual work to a cosmological</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.560" end="01:02:15.089" style="s2">understanding so the in Taoism you go</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.869" end="01:02:17.640" style="s2">from the microcosmic order to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.089" end="01:02:19.920" style="s2">macrocosmic order which if the heavens</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.640" end="01:02:21.540" style="s2">and the manege envisioned as the link</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.920" end="01:02:25.260" style="s2">between the macrocosmic and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.540" end="01:02:27.660" style="s2">microcosmic order and I think that there</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.260" end="01:02:30.180" style="s2">is actually a missing link and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.660" end="01:02:33.510" style="s2">what I would call the miso cosmic order</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.180" end="01:02:36.390" style="s2">something in between being an individual</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.510" end="01:02:39.300" style="s2">and an understanding and then being part</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.390" end="01:02:42.450" style="s2">of the greatest Universal cosmological</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.300" end="01:02:45.480" style="s2">story I think there&#39;s a Me&#39;s or cosmic</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.450" end="01:02:49.230" style="s2">story and I think that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.480" end="01:02:51.170" style="s2">looking at culture to be that story but</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.230" end="01:02:53.910" style="s2">culture is problematic because what</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.170" end="01:02:56.790" style="s2">primarily will we see in human cultures</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.910" end="01:02:58.920" style="s2">is that they&#39;re not integrated with</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.790" end="01:03:02.430" style="s2">nature they&#39;ve defined themselves</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.920" end="01:03:04.849" style="s2">primarily exclusion to nature and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.430" end="01:03:08.250" style="s2">think this concept of collective</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.849" end="01:03:10.829" style="s2">participation is the mezzo story so we</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.250" end="01:03:15.349" style="s2">can start participating not only with</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.829" end="01:03:18.650" style="s2">each other in this real kind of active</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.349" end="01:03:22.680" style="s2">spontaneous way but we can start again</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.650" end="01:03:24.780" style="s2">to invite other creatures the animals</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.680" end="01:03:28.440" style="s2">back in the plants back so we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.780" end="01:03:31.099" style="s2">to take back all of the you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.440" end="01:03:34.109" style="s2">exclusions that we made when we started</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.099" end="01:03:36.740" style="s2">naming what was a person what wasn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.109" end="01:03:40.349" style="s2">we can start doing this participatory</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.740" end="01:03:42.599" style="s2">collective enactment first with all of</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.349" end="01:03:45.089" style="s2">the humans and then we can start adding</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.599" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">back all the beings in nature and this</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.089" end="01:03:51.710" style="s2">would be the Meisel level that the story</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:55.170" style="s2">of the earth itself which stands between</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.710" end="01:03:58.680" style="s2">the microcosmic and the macrocosmic so</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.170" end="01:04:02.430" style="s2">that&#39;s my big idea I really thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.680" end="01:04:05.790" style="s2">because I hear also whenever you talk</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.430" end="01:04:11.460" style="s2">about the exclusion from nature and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.790" end="01:04:17.670" style="s2">men basically creating a cosmos as an</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.460" end="01:04:20.430" style="s2">organized structure of a reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.670" end="01:04:22.950" style="s2">actually also echoing the aims</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.430" end="01:04:26.250" style="s2">Griet philosophy and cosmology because</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.950" end="01:04:31.380" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s the great ancient Greek</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.250" end="01:04:33.840" style="s2">word cosmos right which arose when the</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.380" end="01:04:37.020" style="s2">chaos the universe of this was pretty</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.840" end="01:04:39.720" style="s2">chaotic and so the Greek gods or the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.020" end="01:04:41.760" style="s2">Greek philosophers have both put their</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.720" end="01:04:44.370" style="s2">heads together and basically figure it</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.760" end="01:04:47.720" style="s2">out how to create cosmos out of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.370" end="01:04:52.220" style="s2">like for example you know looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.720" end="01:04:56.310" style="s2">firmament as it stars up on the sky and</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.220" end="01:04:59.970" style="s2">organizing them in certain patterns that</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.310" end="01:05:03.390" style="s2">can be divided them into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.970" end="01:05:05.850" style="s2">constellations of course nowadays we</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.390" end="01:05:07.470" style="s2">know that those constellations don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.850" end="01:05:09.690" style="s2">exist because the stars and</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.470" end="01:05:11.820" style="s2">constellations are not really close to</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.690" end="01:05:13.880" style="s2">each other whatever it&#39;s just from this</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.820" end="01:05:16.710" style="s2">particular perspective where we are and</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.880" end="01:05:20.010" style="s2">we see them relatively close together</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.710" end="01:05:22.050" style="s2">and of course the pattern that makes no</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.010" end="01:05:24.150" style="s2">sense whatsoever if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.050" end="01:05:27.060" style="s2">indoctrinated in a particular culture</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.150" end="01:05:31.380" style="s2">that was associated with these devil</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.060" end="01:05:33.960" style="s2">patterns but they formed the cosmos out</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.380" end="01:05:36.750" style="s2">of chaos to make their lives a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.960" end="01:05:40.740" style="s2">bit more organized and little bit easier</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.750" end="01:05:43.980" style="s2">to indoctrinate others into this way of</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.740" end="01:05:46.020" style="s2">living it&#39;s actually the children well</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.980" end="01:05:48.540" style="s2">you know telling the cosmology and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.020" end="01:05:50.700" style="s2">children story of creation is an easy</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.540" end="01:05:52.200" style="s2">way to indoctrinate a child into</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.700" end="01:05:55.700" style="s2">believing in cosmos rather than</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.200" end="01:05:58.550" style="s2">perceiving life as it is as a chaos</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.700" end="01:06:01.470" style="s2">right but then every culture had its own</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.550" end="01:06:05.400" style="s2">cosmology and there was another part of</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.470" end="01:06:07.310" style="s2">this separation of you know different</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.400" end="01:06:10.170" style="s2">peoples into different</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.310" end="01:06:12.630" style="s2">cosmologies and different eschatology</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.170" end="01:06:15.030" style="s2">which is like how you get saved and</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.630" end="01:06:18.120" style="s2">other people don&#39;t get saved and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.030" end="01:06:20.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a yeah so those stories go from</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.120" end="01:06:24.720" style="s2">the individual to the cosmological</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.730" end="01:06:26.550" style="s2">through this cultural lens so I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.720" end="01:06:29.490" style="s2">that there is the potential for a</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.550" end="01:06:31.980" style="s2">different type of story a mezzo story in</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.490" end="01:06:33.110" style="s2">the middle one that is you know doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.980" end="01:06:35.930" style="s2">have these</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.110" end="01:06:38.540" style="s2">legionary problems and can actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.930" end="01:06:42.680" style="s2">begin to build more inclusion with all</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.540" end="01:06:46.400" style="s2">all the beings well exactly and of</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.680" end="01:06:49.250" style="s2">course both of us probably adhere to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.400" end="01:06:52.060" style="s2">understanding that even if anybody is</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.250" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">going to get saved it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.060" end="01:06:57.350" style="s2">somebody is going to come and save us</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:07:00.560" style="s2">specifically are responsible for our own</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.350" end="01:07:02.690" style="s2">salvation and the salvation if from this</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.560" end="01:07:05.120" style="s2">point of view of course is essentially</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.690" end="01:07:07.910" style="s2">setting ourselves free of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.120" end="01:07:10.490" style="s2">stereotypes of thinking and having this</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.910" end="01:07:12.560" style="s2">type of insight and if we experience it</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.490" end="01:07:17.390" style="s2">collectively well then it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.560" end="01:07:20.630" style="s2">a collective enlightenment rather than</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.390" end="01:07:24.020" style="s2">an individual enlightenment examination</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.630" end="01:07:25.850" style="s2">of your go ahead yeah and we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.020" end="01:07:29.300" style="s2">it together and I think that this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.850" end="01:07:31.490" style="s2">what modern life has really keeps</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.300" end="01:07:35.150" style="s2">telling us that we&#39;re all individuals</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.490" end="01:07:36.470" style="s2">but we&#39;re the sum total of our activity</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.150" end="01:07:39.140" style="s2">we&#39;re all in it together</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.470" end="01:07:44.990" style="s2">you know what the human race as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.140" end="01:07:47.660" style="s2">has a huge impact and so to work or be</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.990" end="01:07:50.900" style="s2">everywhere together at that level is</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.660" end="01:07:53.660" style="s2">really important human race has a</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.900" end="01:07:57.410" style="s2">horrendous impact it&#39;s oh my god I</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.660" end="01:07:59.840" style="s2">personally view the way that humans</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.410" end="01:08:03.770" style="s2">exist on the face of planet Earth as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.840" end="01:08:06.200" style="s2">form of cancer because just like cancer</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.770" end="01:08:10.400" style="s2">cells we just keep propagating for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.200" end="01:08:12.770" style="s2">sake of multiplication in the road seems</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.400" end="01:08:16.220" style="s2">to be no stopping it doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.770" end="01:08:19.700" style="s2">for one human to be enlightened or have</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.220" end="01:08:23.630" style="s2">insight and just then be happy with</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.700" end="01:08:26.630" style="s2">their own salvation because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.630" end="01:08:30.320" style="s2">stop the problem you know everybody</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.630" end="01:08:32.690" style="s2">needs to be yeah we&#39;re all in the soup</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.320" end="01:08:36.170" style="s2">together here even every one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.690" end="01:08:38.720" style="s2">whole planets in the same soup the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.170" end="01:08:42.710" style="s2">predicament yeah absolutely well and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.720" end="01:08:44.960" style="s2">funny thing is that again referring back</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.710" end="01:08:46.850" style="s2">to the old spiritual school of thought</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.960" end="01:08:50.440" style="s2">and Buddhism especially my</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.850" end="01:08:53.210" style="s2">I on abuddin there is a tradition of</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.440" end="01:08:55.280" style="s2">bodhisattva and bodhisattva is not</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.210" end="01:08:58.780" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s the savior who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.280" end="01:09:03.440" style="s2">come and save everyone but in a sense an</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.780" end="01:09:07.190" style="s2">individual or being that as attained a</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:10.490" style="s2">level of spiritual awakening and realize</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.190" end="01:09:13.700" style="s2">that we can&#39;t really be awake in this</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.490" end="01:09:17.270" style="s2">dream that we call our lives if there</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.700" end="01:09:19.970" style="s2">are some dream characters some other</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.270" end="01:09:22.790" style="s2">beings that are not awake because</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.970" end="01:09:26.150" style="s2">essentially if you run into any dream</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.790" end="01:09:28.040" style="s2">characters in your dream who tell you no</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.150" end="01:09:28.660" style="s2">this is not a dream this is happening</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.040" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">for real</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.660" end="01:09:34.850" style="s2">they are simply trying to convince you</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:37.370" style="s2">not to be awake and apparently they</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.850" end="01:09:39.770" style="s2">reflect that aspect of your dreaming</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.370" end="01:09:42.620" style="s2">mind that doesn&#39;t believe it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.770" end="01:09:44.440" style="s2">awake so in other words there are still</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.620" end="01:09:47.150" style="s2">some aspects of your consciousness that</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.440" end="01:09:49.970" style="s2">have room for improvement that can still</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.150" end="01:09:51.980" style="s2">be awakened right exactly and once</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.970" end="01:09:54.950" style="s2">you&#39;re awakened you realize that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.980" end="01:09:57.920" style="s2">other is not other anyways so only part</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.950" end="01:10:00.260" style="s2">of you is is actually awake or the</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.920" end="01:10:03.260" style="s2">philosopher Roy Bhaskar talks about</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.260" end="01:10:05.150" style="s2">building a society where the full</p>

<p begin="01:10:22.880" end="01:10:28.340" style="s2">the situation we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.290" end="01:10:33.740" style="s2">we simply cannot fully flourish and</p>
