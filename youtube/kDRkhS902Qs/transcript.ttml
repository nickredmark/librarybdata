<p begin="00:07:11.770" end="00:07:15.550" style="s2">examples of why this works</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:17.590" style="s2">many of the stem bucks we click the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.550" end="00:07:21.640" style="s2">mushroom in the wild if you&#39;re a bear or</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.640" end="00:07:25.510" style="s2">by because it got dirt and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.230" end="00:07:27.130" style="s2">eat the mushroom without dirt so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.510" end="00:07:28.300" style="s2">picked mushrooms we take a few steps we</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.130" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">trim off the stem but we throw it on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.300" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">ground turns out their stem butts regrow</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:35.200" style="s2">with an enormous vigor totally</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.550" end="00:07:38.170" style="s2">unexpected the caps won&#39;t do that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.200" end="00:07:40.630" style="s2">caps will rot the stem butts the big</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.170" end="00:07:42.250" style="s2">butt of stem becomes mycelium and so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.630" end="00:07:44.290" style="s2">can put that onto cardboard and create</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.250" end="00:07:46.300" style="s2">sheet mulch and the good thing about</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.290" end="00:07:48.190" style="s2">that mycelium coming from stem pots it</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.300" end="00:07:50.140" style="s2">has an immune system it&#39;s already in</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.190" end="00:07:52.540" style="s2">tact with the microbes and so it already</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.140" end="00:07:54.640" style="s2">has defenses against the pair of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.540" end="00:07:57.250" style="s2">microbial parasites that it&#39;s in contact</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.640" end="00:07:59.080" style="s2">with then he grows sheets of mycelium</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.250" end="00:08:00.340" style="s2">out on wet cardboard corrugated</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.080" end="00:08:02.170" style="s2">cardboard and a mycelium grows really</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.340" end="00:08:03.640" style="s2">quickly down the corrugations then you</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.170" end="00:08:05.320" style="s2">can put wood chips on top of that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.640" end="00:08:08.140" style="s2">then you end up with a mycelial membrane</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.320" end="00:08:11.650" style="s2">a mother patch and then this mother</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.140" end="00:08:14.470" style="s2">patch can be put out in along trails and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.650" end="00:08:16.150" style="s2">you end up with veins and the cool thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.470" end="00:08:17.890" style="s2">about my psyllium this has follows the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.150" end="00:08:20.140" style="s2">path often times of human footsteps</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.890" end="00:08:22.480" style="s2">because as we build trails in the woods</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.140" end="00:08:24.940" style="s2">we break sticks underneath the mycelium</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.480" end="00:08:26.920" style="s2">senses that newly available nutrition so</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.940" end="00:08:28.870" style="s2">surges so a lot of these fungi have</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.920" end="00:08:31.420" style="s2">actually been following human activity</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.870" end="00:08:34.660" style="s2">for thousands of years and so the wood</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.420" end="00:08:36.250" style="s2">chip loving the mushrooms including the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.660" end="00:08:40.060" style="s2">philosophy the soul type of mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.250" end="00:08:42.340" style="s2">are really localized on the debris</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.060" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">fields of humans and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.340" end="00:08:45.610" style="s2">that even though species could have very</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.190" end="00:09:01.089" style="s2">limelight but we found that group to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.290" end="00:09:03.370" style="s2">especially active and breaking down VX</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.089" end="00:09:05.380" style="s2">which Saddam Hussein did use against the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.370" end="00:09:07.839" style="s2">Kurds and those mushrooms produce an</p>

<p begin="00:09:14.459" end="00:09:21.550" style="s2">specifically psilocybin mushrooms did</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.470" end="00:09:23.529" style="s2">that but here&#39;s an example where if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.550" end="00:09:25.329" style="s2">have a mushroom this illegal that will</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.529" end="00:09:28.209" style="s2">have a tremendously positive effect that</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.519" end="00:09:34.510" style="s2">becomes a complicated endeavor one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.950" end="00:09:36.310" style="s2">the biggest challenges that we face is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.510" end="00:09:39.640" style="s2">that you mentioned mushrooms people make</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.310" end="00:09:41.529" style="s2">fun of you and so I put it to you what</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.640" end="00:09:43.390" style="s2">politician will stick their neck out</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.529" end="00:09:46.440" style="s2">saying we should invest in mushroom</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.440" end="00:09:50.949" style="s2">actually the US Defense Department is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.910" end="00:09:53.949" style="s2">cool that they actually see that as</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.949" end="00:09:55.449" style="s2">being very plausible and medical</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.949" end="00:09:58.660" style="s2">practice and doctors who are in the</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.660" end="00:10:02.380" style="s2">pathogens in particular they get it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.029" end="00:10:04.449" style="s2">mushrooms don&#39;t like the rock they</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.380" end="00:10:06.519" style="s2">produce a host defensive immunity</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.449" end="00:10:07.720" style="s2">against microbes until they sport elated</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.519" end="00:10:09.370" style="s2">and after they&#39;d sporty late they rot</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.720" end="00:10:12.010" style="s2">but up at that point in time they</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.370" end="00:10:14.680" style="s2">forestall many of the same microbial</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.010" end="00:10:16.779" style="s2">diseases that afflict us but you come to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.680" end="00:10:19.329" style="s2">a politician and who has a political</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.779" end="00:10:23.860" style="s2">career he was in charge of budgets</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.329" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">governments and policy good luck because</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.860" end="00:10:27.610" style="s2">the politicians did not want to be made</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:30.180" style="s2">fun of and if they have a adversary</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.610" end="00:10:32.050" style="s2">who&#39;s anti nature you know anti</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.180" end="00:10:35.589" style="s2">environmentalists then they could use</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.050" end="00:10:37.089" style="s2">them as a target and so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.589" end="00:10:39.130" style="s2">think this is another problem that we</p>
