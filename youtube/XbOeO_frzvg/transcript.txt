Hello
 This is my message for millennials
 On how to change the world
 Rather, I would say, "How to change the world right."
 Of course the next question will be what do you mean by saying it correctly
 And certainly this is the main issue
 So I'll talk about that briefly
 I will also offer a suggestion
 Every millennial is ready to watch this
 The reason for raising this topic was
 Before something I read recently
 By Jonathan Haidt
 Jonathan Haidt is a professor of ethical leadership
 In New York University for a rigorous business education
 He was a clever commentator at the last time
 About some political conflicts
 That occurs in the social sciences
 By note for example
 That there is a dearth of political diversity in viewpoints in the social sciences and perhaps even less
 By people specializing in the humanities
 And Haidt recently wrote something
 I will link to it in the description of the video
 And in it he claimed that universities have to make up their minds
 Between social justice and truth
 And at the tip of the truth put
 Philosopher John Stuart Mill
 The English philosopher who said:
 "He who knows only his side of the case
 Little is known about this issue
 May his arguments be good
 No one can refute it
 But if he is not equally able to refute the arguments against him on the other side
 And if he does not do much to find out who they are
 It has no basis for preferring any opinion. "
 And after that
 In comparison, he put John Stuart next to Karl Marx.
 Who said, "Philosophers only interpreted the world in different ways the aim was to change it."
 Marx was considered the saintly leader
 For the University of Social Justice
 Which is geared towards changing the world
 By overthrowing the structures of power and privilege
 It sees political diversity as a hindrance
 Mel, on the other hand, according to Haidt.
 He is the Saint Commander
 What is called the University of Truth
 Which sees reality as a process
 It pushes people to test each other's biases and incomplete logic, and through this process everyone gets smarter
 "Haidt" indicates that the University of Truth dies when it is ideologically united or politically intolerant
 I think this video is part of my claim on Jonathan Haidt's side.
 For youth to join "Truth University"
 But there is a problem with that
 Because the university is the place to search the truth
 This is the basis of the university
 But there is a problem, which is that young people want to change the world
 He is part of what Piguet calls the developmental psychologist
 Piguet calls it the "stage of Christ."
 And there is some benefit from that
 Because we are social beings
 While we are building ourselves
 And while we shape ourselves
 And we bring our personalities into existence
 Based on our biological strength. On our biological existence
 We also have to, in return, integrate and adapt
 We adapt to merge with the negotiation with the community
 And according to which sometimes has to change
 The structure of society must be preserved
 But it must be updated and improved as it progresses
 Therefore the problem is how to update and improve it
 Without doing it in a quick way
 So that you destroy everything valuable
 So the problem that I find in the Marxist perspective
 And I have this problem with him for a long time
 I don't think you should trust people who are their primary target
 When they try to change the world for the better, by changing other people
 And you can know these people because they always blame others
 And they are looking for victims
 They are looking for perpetrators and victims
 Then they proceed to stop the perpetrators
 And I think that is wrong
 Because, as he said, "Alexander Solzhenitsyn" is a great Russian writer
 He helped overthrow the Soviet Union
 He said, "The line between good and evil runs in the heart of every person."
 So the basic battle
 According to what I think
 This falls within the tradition that put "John Stuart Mill."
 It is "to overcome tyranny and hatred."
 Anarchy, nihilism, desire and urging everything to stop
 You have to repair the gaps
 And cracks
 In your soul, simply
 And that means you have to face
 The evil that inhabits your heart
 A statement from the New Testament
 Which in my opinion fits with this idea
 This is part of "Sermon on the Mount."
 It is a central text in the Western tradition
 And clearly the central text of Christianity
 But it is central to everything built by Western civilization
 And in it, Christ addresses his followers
 Why are you looking at the moth?
 Which is in your brother's eye
 As for the plank in your eyes, do not notice it?
 Or how do you say to your brother;
 Let me get the speck out of your eye
 And here is the wood in your eye?
 You hypocrite, first get the plank out of your eye
 And at that time you will see well to get the speck out of your brother's eye
 I like this quote
 Because he places the responsibility
 For a change in every stage of existence
 On the individual
 It is clear that the individual interacts with society
 But the idea is here
 Unless the individual did
 Straighten his soul
 There is no possibility of impact
 Which the individual will leave on society
 Only to be something other than harmful
 The same amount of harm that still exists in the soul
 These are important things to know
 These are very important things to know
 But then we face the conundrum that young people, too, want to change the world
 But this is not a problem
 Because I think you can
 Bring the "University of Truth" alike with desire
 To make a real change
 But change has to start from the right start
 So I'll tell you how I think
 You have to change yourselves in order to change the world
 And so the world that you bring into being is the best, not the worst
 Remember
 You have to know this
 The world that Marxâ€™s followers brought into existence in the twentieth century
 More than a hundred million people were killed
 In China and Russia
 I mean the Soviet Union and regions like Cambodia and Vietnam
 Of course the world has changed as a result of the Marxist dogma
 But he did not change in the good path
 And, of course, the Marxist faith
 It makes itself heard
 In a colossal way
 Again across the west now
 So what do you have to do about it?
 Take this idea
 The first thing you have to do is direct yourself
 Most of you have probably seen the movie "Pinocchio."
 And "Pinocchio" is about a doll
 Its strands are attracted by forces outside of its absorption
 This is the position of the immature individual
 Gibto is a good father
 It represents the symbol of good, "the symbol of a beneficial / good civilization."
 He makes a doll to be his son
 And then he makes a wish from the star
 A star is something that shines in the sky
 It is linked to the transcendent, the backward and the divine
 If you look at the sky at night
 The place was very dark
 You feel dread
 Because you face your souls
 So to speak, "your individual soul faces the universe."
 And you can feel the relationship
 Between you and
 the college
 So looking at the sky
 It is more like a religious experience
 If a sky is full of stars
 He asked for a wish from the star
 It is finding the light that guides you
 As the North Star
 Let us seek the ultimate goal
 To seek the ultimate goal that you can imagine
 This is what Gpeto does.
 He raises his eyes
 About his daily concerns
 He tries to establish a relationship
 With the highest possible values
 It also has the deepest wishes
 And the most deepest wishes
 Is that the doll he made
 You may turn out to be a real individual
 Real and complete as a mature human
 This is what you can wish for yourself
 You can wish
 And seek it in yourself
 This way you deal with suffering
 That are present in life
 Because life is suffering
 And because life is very difficult
 People may get sick
 And they become mentally ill
 And there is malice in the world
 And there are misfortunes
 This is why life is very, very difficult
 If it is not oriented correctly
 With regard to life
 The fact that it is difficult
 And it is full of suffering
 Because that may divert you, woe and tie you
 Until you become a thug
 And malevolent
 And it may become more than shedding and hatred
 To wish massacres
 And even that you wish everything destroyed
 Therefore, you must learn to strengthen yourself as an individual so that you can bear the burden of existence without being corrupt
 You have to decide that this is what you are seeking
 You want to be a fully fledged human being
 And you stop being a pathetic doll
 Their leads are attracted by terrible forces behind the scenes
 To wish the star
 It is to strive for the supreme good
 The question then is
 What is good?
 We can answer this in two ways
 We can say that good is the opposite of evil
 And I can tell you what evil is
 Evil is the conscious desire to achieve suffering
 When suffering is not necessary
 If you read about what happened
 In the Nazi concentration camps
 For example
 Or in Russian concentration camps in the Soviet Union
 You will find what helps you about what constitutes evil
 Evil is the desire to take advantage of the weakness of others
 To take advantage of others' weaknesses with self-awareness
 And to escalate their suffering beyond their endurance
 So the good is the opposite
 Whatever the opposite
 Goodness blinds its explanation
 But here is one hint
 And I understood this by reading "John Piguet"
 Developmental Psychologist
 Piguet spoke of the "standard phase."
 The "standard stage" is like a game that children play
 And in it every child wants to play the game
 You have a small social group and this is the children's play group
 And the individuals who are in it
 These are individual children
 And structure is the game
 And it's a good game if everyone wants to play it
 Bigger is not lucky to have a game like this
 You will beat a game that tyrannizes people to play
 Because it does not entail a forced application of costs
 So the idea of â€‹â€‹the "standard stage" was developed.
 To think that
 If you seek good
 You want what is best for you
 And I mean fine to you as if you are taking care of yourself
 Or treat yourself like someone you love
 Which will be good for you and your family too
 Which in turn will be good for you, for your family, and for the community
 So it will be good for you, for your family, for society, and then for the world
 Then it will be good for now
 Then it will be okay for next week
 And the week after that
 And a year from now
 And even the future as you can see
 So the goodness is something that balances out
 Between multiple stages of existence
 In multiple time frames at the same time
 You don't have to know
 What will happen from this at any moment
 But you can direct yourself
 That this is the state you want to be in
 And I can tell you
 As far as I can tell
 When in this state
 Even if moment by moment
 Your life is saturated with a sense of meaning
 This sense of meaning
 It helps you to stand up from the suffering
 The philosopher "Nietzsche" says:
 "A person who lives for a purpose can endure anyway."
 So the idea of â€‹â€‹"Nietzsche" was
 If there is a purpose for your life
 Nobly enough
 It's not just that suffering in life is acceptable
 But it may also be commendable
 You may be ready to bear the burden of existence
 Because of the exciting things you can do with existence
 Things that you can build and achieve
 This may be the highest imaginative state of existence
 This is a form of paradise
 But it is not the paradise that you attain by changing others
 But it is the paradise that you attain
 By changing yourself
 This is a difficult thing to do
 It's scary to do
 Because it means
 That you are reshaping your soul
 This is a task for someone who is truly honest and noble
 It's interesting enough
 To keep you occupied for the rest of your life
 And then magic things will happen to you
 While doing it
 And the world will be around you
 In a more amazing way
 Musically
 So that every part of what you live
 He plays against every other part
 In a way that is deeply meaningful from every aspect in it
 By the way, you are experiencing that
 When you listen to a piece of music you love
 Music represents that
 Because music nourishes the soul
 And because it is the highest form of art
 At least from my point of view
 So you have to live your life
 As if
 Existence is a symphony
 And you are playing the part of your track
 Once you direct yourself
 So you have commitment
 A commitment to developing your soul
 To speak the truth
 However, you have to be properly oriented
 Because the truth
 Something exists as an interest for an ideal
 Like a top of sorts
 Then you can imagine that you are using your language in two ways
 You can use your language to manipulate the world
 And get what you want from it
 As an example
 Maybe go out on a date with someone
 It was decided that the final goal of it was the date
 Is that you get a partner to have sex tonight
 Then you can configure your language
 To influence the person until he saves you
 What you want
 This is a manual use of language
 But
 The problem is that
 There are several problems with that
 But one of them is
 What if your idea of â€‹â€‹what to seek is wrong?
 Perhaps that is not the way it should be treated
 The person you are on a date with
 Maybe you reduce or decrease
 The interactions between you
 Than it may be
 health condition
 And thin
 Of interaction and dialogue
 To something
 Simply the pursuit of impulsive pleasures
 And maybe that is not good for you
 For the next week and the next
 And next month
 Directing yourself to impulsive pleasures can be a very bad idea
 Remember what happened in Pinocchio.
 Pinocchio goes to the island of pleasures
 And the island of pleasures is a place where he gets impulsive pleasures at the same moment
 But what Pinocchio discovers with Jimny, the night cockroach
 That the island of pleasure is governed by two masked tyrants
 They all wear black
 All of you remember that they are transforming the kids and teens on the island of Pleasure
 They deny them their voices by turning them into the minds of donkeys
 And preparing to sell them as slaves to the salt mines
 So there is an implication in the story that the pursuit of impulsive pleasures
 It is one of the paths of totalitarianism and slavery
 And I believe in that
 So the possibility of directing your language towards the attainment of impulsive pleasures
 It is a misuse of your highest gift
 The gift of slogans, the gift of communication
 The alternative is to direct yourself to the ultimate good, as we explained earlier
 And then speak the truth
 You can know that you are doing it or you can know that you are not
 Because if you are not speaking the truth
 And you were using someone else's words
 You are being deceived by meaning by behind-the-scenes forces
 You don't use your own words
 You are the puppet of an ideology, another thinker, or of your impulsive desires
 And you can know when you speak that
 Because it makes you feel weak and ashamed
 And you can determine this feeling physiologically
 If you listen to yourself while you speak
 You can know when you speak the right way that you will experience a feeling of inclusion and strength
 And when you speak in a misleading or manipulative way
 Feel like you are falling apart in layers
 What you need to do is practice only saying the things that make you feel stronger
 This will mean from the start that you will notice that most of what you are saying is a lie
 It is either a lie or someone else's words
 It is very difficult to find your own words, but you do not really exist until you find your own
 Then you try to teach yourself how to speak your own truth
 You listen to other people while you do this
 Because they can help you shape and correct your words
 They will react poorly to it if your thoughts are poorly worded
 If you listen and pay attention then you will know how to formulate your words
 In a more clear and accurate way
 And that makes you more powerful
 It gives you more power which is one of the benefits of forms of strength
 So you do it and then you have to make the decision to believe
 And that is simply either to use your language to manipulate the world and make it achieve what you want
 Or, use your language to try to pronounce the truth as carefully as possible
 Then you can see what is happening
 You have to give up your desire for the sake of the consequences you want
 You have to assume that if he talks to you the truth
 The results are the best possible under the circumstances
 It's an exciting way to live in a sense
 It's like walking down a cliff because you don't know what will happen next
 If all you do is say what you think
 You might be at work, say what you think, and then get fired
 Then she says, "Oh my God what a terrible misfortune."
 But maybe it's not like that because maybe if you worked in a place and you had to lie in order to keep your job
 You probably shouldn't be there
 Maybe your soul will die and destroy you
 Permanently and make you spoiled
 Therefore, you must guide yourself and speak the truth as carefully as you can
 You have to listen to others in order to correct your speech
 Then you have to allow the consequences to unfold as they are
 This is the ultimate act of faith
 This is what you do if you belong to the "University of Truth."
 With a more practical speech, then you have to educate yourself
 And that's not easy work now
 Because you have to find people who can really tell you what to read
 And maybe also how to write because writing is a way of expressing your thoughts more precisely
 That's why you go to college to learn how to write
 If you know how to write then you will be able to think
 If you can think, speak and communicate write
 Then you are incredibly powerful
 According to the authority level
 Because the arguments are moving the world forward
 If your arguments are coherent, well-structured, clear, and well-adjusted
 And analyzed carefully
 And you have five displays of logic for everything you do
 This is what will happen if you learn how to write correctly
 Then you are a force of nature, man
 No one can defeat you
 This is one of the things that are not taught to people
 Why go to learn, especially in the humanities
 Teaching "humanities" if real, organizes the basics of your mind
 He drops you to the ground, puts you on a rock, and makes you a strength to fight
 But you have to read for the right people
 These are the great people of the past on my list
 These are the greatest men of the past, and that's it
 I suggested these and made two lists to read on "Jordanbpeterson.com".
 And the people whose books I suggested in the first place were written before
 Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy who, in my opinion, is the greatest novelist the world has known
 Alexander Solzhenitsyn is another great Russian novelist, and I donâ€™t know what the Russiansâ€™s story is about, but man, they are producing a book like no other.
 Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote a book called "The Gulag Archipelago" in which he analyzed the Soviet prison system of detention centers that emerged after the Leninist revolution in the second century of the twentieth century.
 He detailed, with great precision, how the Marxist principles that had to liberate everyone and change the world
 It produced legislation that was completely deadly in its consequences
 Solzhenitsyn carefully traces the logical path from original Marxist principles to legislation and even genocide.
 Because you will hear people who are simply Marxists who will say something like "True Marxism did not exist" and "Solzhenitsyn" made this argument separately in the mid-1970s.
 And the "Gulag Archipelago" was an ideological bomb that destroyed all the credibility of Marxism for intellectual respect.
 You have to read the book. The book contains the central problem that is in our culture today. If you do not read it, you are not informed and you can only participate in the discussion as a doll.
 So I will not suggest participating in the discussion as a puppet because you do not know behind the scenes and he pulls strings if you remember the story of "Pinocchio"
 The forces that were pulling the strings were not forces working in the best interest of "Pinocchio". This is for sure
 Guruj Uriel is an English essay writer and unparalleled commentator on socialist totalitarianism even though he is a leftist and an innovator.
 Aldous Huxley wrote "Brave New World" and I have wonderful things to say about the potential devastation of sexual choice and sexual partner selection as part of a dystopian future.
 Friedrich Nietzsche is a philosopher who describes himself as a person who thought of a hammer, and Nietzsche is a very, very dangerous person, and a really clever writer.
 And Karl Jung, who was a student of Nietzsche, and Nietzsche is the philosopher who announced the death of God earlier in the late 1800's, and Jung spent his entire life trying to resurrect the Lord, and this is one way of thinking about it
 Educate yourself This is a good way to start. If you are reading these authors then you will know what to read as well
 If you read to these authors it will take you a long time and it will be very, very difficult for you
 And you will not be the same person when you get out of it and this is very, very terrifying to be torn and rebuilt is not a joke, but it strongly overcomes the alternative.
 Which just means being sluggish and being a sluggish baby is something I wouldn't recommend
 Nothing is worse than a stagnant forty baby
 So that's just the equivalent of your information to Pinocchio. We go back to the story of Pinocchio when he saves Gibto from the underworld.
 You remember when he was turned into a half-donkey after he was on "The Island of Pleasure," he was seduced by two people, the fox and the cat.
 And those who tried to seduce him into believing that he was a victim and that he needed leave
 Therefore, "Pinocchio" was seduced to "The Island of Pleasures" by two characters who played with his victim feeling, his nerves and his suffering to convince him that he should not bear any responsibility for his existence.
 And that he can occupy himself with his impulsive pleasures, and in this way he fell into the hands of tyrants on the "island of pleasures."
 However, after Pinocchio left the Island of Pleasure, he had to head to the beach twice
 The second time he headed to the beach, he was looking for his father
 A father to anyone, according to the mythical perspective, dies in the underworld in chaos because everyone inherits a sick and ancient civilization, so to speak.
 It is sick and old because it was formed by the dead and the living must resurrect it continuously until it becomes a controlling force
 And the living have to resurrect their connection with civilization internally as well, because your structure is from civilization, even though not only the structures of civilization
 You have to understand history, otherwise you will not understand yourself, for you are a historical being
 So you have to save your dead father from the belly of the beast from the dragon
 Because if you remember that the whale in "Pinocchio" is also a fire-breathing dragon
 This means that you have to face your most feared fear and when you do then you will save your father from the underworld
 These are very complex ideas, and you can read about them in my book, "Maps of Meaning". If you want in the reading list, put a free copy, you can on the "Jordanbpeterson.com" website, where I talk in detail about these matters.
 However, you have to resurrect your father before you can be real
 This is one of the problems with feminism and the social justice fighter by their insistence on the existence of a patriarchal society
 Everyone knows since the beginning of history that civilization is corrupt and tyrannical, but at the same time it is protective and beneficial
 Even the language you use is part of civilization. You do not bring down patriarchal society, but revive your civilization
 And you do this by taking responsibility for your own existence and then acting as a moral agent in civilization
 This is what you do to become an educated person. Read these books, they will change your life. I guarantee that they will change your life.
 They will destroy you, destroy you, and then rebuild you for something higher than you are now
 Harry, you are in pain.
 do not worry
 Jenny, you need to find a way out
 Follow the hall and you will find Ron
 You are a genius, Foxes
 I wasn't just fast enough
 Sure
 Phoenix tears have healing powers
 Thank you
 It's all right, Jenny
 This is what it seeks
 This will help
 Colleagues and I have developed a series of online writing programs entitled "The Self authring sweet".
 It helps people to write about, organize, and understand their past and present personality
 Then the Future and the Future Composition Program asks you to write about six different dimensions of your life
 So he asks you first to treat yourself as someone you want to help, someone you love and care about, and someone you want to help
 Then he asks if you can organize your life in the best possible way
 Along with the principles we discussed earlier
 what do you want? What do you want for your profession?
 What do you really want?
 What will make your life valuable? What do you want for your profession?
 What do you want for your family? And from your family? What do you want from an intimate relationship?
 How will you take care of your physical and mental health? How will you deal with the use of alcohol and drugs?
 It asks you a series of basic questions like these
 To move your mind
 Then he asks you to write for 15 minutes about what your life might be like in three or five years into the future
 If it results as if you are drawing the life of someone you deeply care about, then you are required to write about it for 15 minutes without worrying about the structure of the argument or any grammatical checks.
 That postpones until later
 So it gives you a simple paradise to strive for
 Like saying, "Well if I can have that then my life will be worth the trouble, even if I have to struggle for a reasonable time along the way."
 This is what you are trying to build, and you can think of it as a paradise worth moving towards
 The second part of the program asks you to write about what your life could be like in the next three to five years if all of your bad habits and nihilistic tendencies were.
 And your tendencies towards resentment and loss of desire to take responsibility if all your weaknesses take control and knock you down
 And everyone knows that.You know what it would be like if you let everything slip and know what hell you'd be headed towards
 So the second part of the program asks you to write about what your life might be like over the next three to five years if everything around you ended up in hell.
 So it gives you a hell to avoid and a paradise to look towards
 And you need both because that is what keeps you properly motivated in life
 Then, the second half of the program, which represents the next section of the program, helps you transform your vision for the desired future into an achievable reality.
 And its word complementarity and the pronunciation of arguments for why you want it
 It also helps you overcome your own doubts because you don't have to argue against other people only
 It means arguing against the gossip of the demons of nihilism, despair, and ideological monarchy that exist within your mind and society at the same time.
 You need powerful weapons to fight against them
 And here is this offer. We have made a free "future authoring program" available for the next period. I don't know how long the period will be, but let's assume a week or something like that.
 If you go to ((the address is written in the picture))
 You can read about the program there, and now I have to tell you that we have used this program on about 5,000 university students, most of them in the Netherlands but some in Canada as well.
 And what we showed is that if you complete the program, even if you do it badly, and I advise, "Do it badly, man" it doesn't matter that you do it in an excellent way.
 Do it badly and maybe later you can do better as you progress, but at least it does badly
 This program increases the performance of university students, increases their grades between 20 to 25 percent and reduces their withdrawal from studies by the same percentage.
 So we have a statistic of 5,000 people and one of these articles has been published and I will link to it in the description of the video
 So this program really works if you use it so I highly recommend that you do so
 In any case, you can read about this program from there and click on buy for 14.95 and then enter this code (changeyouself) * Note that this may be for the offer now ending
 This is what millennials have to do if they want to change the world
 The first thing they have to do is direct themselves to do good, and this is away from evil, away from hatred, away from vain, pretended suffering, and pain.
 Or rather let us say far from Auschwitz * a Nazi internment camp in Poland * and away from the "Gulag Archipelago" and the heinous Soviet concentration camps and the mass murder that took place in China
 So you want to get as far away from it as possible as you can
 Any direction away from that is a good trend
 After that, you should think about the highest possible good that may appear to you, your family, and your community, as we have already discussed that
 Then you have to speak the truth as related to that
 Then you have to educate yourself
 After that, you have to assume your responsibility, and responsibility is good because it makes you strong under its weight, it makes you strong and enables you to free yourself from your strings.
 Turn yourself into an honest individual, and then take on the world
 And then you're in a position to make a change
 As a person like this, your pure existence will change the world in a positive direction
 This is what you should strive for: Read the books that I have posted on my site. Create a "Creating the Future" program, and this will improve your life greatly
 In this way, you can change the world
