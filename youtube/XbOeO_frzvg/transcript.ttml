<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:02.000" style="s2">Hello</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.000" end="00:00:03.900" style="s2"> This is my message for millennials</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.900" end="00:00:05.520" style="s2"> On how to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.760" end="00:00:07.700" style="s2"> Rather, I would say, &quot;How to change the world right.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.520" end="00:00:11.080" style="s2"> Of course the next question will be what do you mean by saying it correctly</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.720" end="00:00:13.720" style="s2"> And certainly this is the main issue</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.720" end="00:00:15.460" style="s2"> So I&#39;ll talk about that briefly</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:17.540" style="s2"> I will also offer a suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.880" end="00:00:20.800" style="s2"> Every millennial is ready to watch this</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:24.320" style="s2"> The reason for raising this topic was</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.540" end="00:00:26.540" style="s2"> Before something I read recently</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.540" end="00:00:27.280" style="s2"> By Jonathan Haidt</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.820" end="00:00:29.880" style="s2"> Jonathan Haidt is a professor of ethical leadership</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.120" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2"> In New York University for a rigorous business education</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:34.960" style="s2"> He was a clever commentator at the last time</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.960" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2"> About some political conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:38.360" style="s2"> That occurs in the social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:40.460" style="s2"> By note for example</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.060" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2"> That there is a dearth of political diversity in viewpoints in the social sciences and perhaps even less</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2"> By people specializing in the humanities</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.540" end="00:00:50.540" style="s2"> And Haidt recently wrote something</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:54.700" style="s2"> I will link to it in the description of the video</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.060" end="00:00:58.060" style="s2"> And in it he claimed that universities have to make up their minds</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.060" end="00:01:00.580" style="s2"> Between social justice and truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.760" end="00:01:03.140" style="s2"> And at the tip of the truth put</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.400" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2"> Philosopher John Stuart Mill</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:06.860" style="s2"> The English philosopher who said:</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.580" end="00:01:09.580" style="s2"> &quot;He who knows only his side of the case</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.580" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2"> Little is known about this issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:13.100" style="s2"> May his arguments be good</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.100" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2"> No one can refute it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:18.500" style="s2"> But if he is not equally able to refute the arguments against him on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.220" end="00:01:21.220" style="s2"> And if he does not do much to find out who they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.640" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2"> It has no basis for preferring any opinion. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2"> And after that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.400" end="00:01:27.800" style="s2"> In comparison, he put John Stuart next to Karl Marx.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.260" end="00:01:32.260" style="s2"> Who said, &quot;Philosophers only interpreted the world in different ways the aim was to change it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.180" end="00:01:35.180" style="s2"> Marx was considered the saintly leader</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.180" end="00:01:37.040" style="s2"> For the University of Social Justice</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.160" end="00:01:39.160" style="s2"> Which is geared towards changing the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.480" end="00:01:41.480" style="s2"> By overthrowing the structures of power and privilege</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.260" end="00:01:45.260" style="s2"> It sees political diversity as a hindrance</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.460" end="00:01:48.460" style="s2"> Mel, on the other hand, according to Haidt.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.460" end="00:01:49.160" style="s2"> He is the Saint Commander</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.160" end="00:01:50.600" style="s2"> What is called the University of Truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.600" end="00:01:52.240" style="s2"> Which sees reality as a process</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.360" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2"> It pushes people to test each other&#39;s biases and incomplete logic, and through this process everyone gets smarter</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.280" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2"> &quot;Haidt&quot; indicates that the University of Truth dies when it is ideologically united or politically intolerant</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:10.960" style="s2"> I think this video is part of my claim on Jonathan Haidt&#39;s side.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.500" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2"> For youth to join &quot;Truth University&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:15.640" style="s2"> But there is a problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.340" end="00:02:18.920" style="s2"> Because the university is the place to search the truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.920" end="00:02:20.320" style="s2"> This is the basis of the university</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.740" end="00:02:22.740" style="s2"> But there is a problem, which is that young people want to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.740" end="00:02:25.740" style="s2"> He is part of what Piguet calls the developmental psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.740" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2"> Piguet calls it the &quot;stage of Christ.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.280" end="00:02:30.280" style="s2"> And there is some benefit from that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.280" end="00:02:31.960" style="s2"> Because we are social beings</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.480" end="00:02:35.480" style="s2"> While we are building ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.480" end="00:02:36.660" style="s2"> And while we shape ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.020" end="00:02:39.020" style="s2"> And we bring our personalities into existence</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:44.780" style="s2"> Based on our biological strength. On our biological existence</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.300" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2"> We also have to, in return, integrate and adapt</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:49.800" style="s2"> We adapt to merge with the negotiation with the community</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.800" end="00:02:51.400" style="s2"> And according to which sometimes has to change</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.820" end="00:02:53.820" style="s2"> The structure of society must be preserved</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.760" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2"> But it must be updated and improved as it progresses</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.300" end="00:02:59.300" style="s2"> Therefore the problem is how to update and improve it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.120" end="00:03:02.120" style="s2"> Without doing it in a quick way</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.120" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2"> So that you destroy everything valuable</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.100" end="00:03:07.100" style="s2"> So the problem that I find in the Marxist perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.340" end="00:03:09.340" style="s2"> And I have this problem with him for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.260" end="00:03:12.760" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think you should trust people who are their primary target</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:17.800" style="s2"> When they try to change the world for the better, by changing other people</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.900" end="00:03:20.900" style="s2"> And you can know these people because they always blame others</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.900" end="00:03:22.060" style="s2"> And they are looking for victims</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.060" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2"> They are looking for perpetrators and victims</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.940" end="00:03:25.940" style="s2"> Then they proceed to stop the perpetrators</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.940" end="00:03:27.660" style="s2"> And I think that is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.460" end="00:03:30.940" style="s2"> Because, as he said, &quot;Alexander Solzhenitsyn&quot; is a great Russian writer</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.940" end="00:03:32.700" style="s2"> He helped overthrow the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.380" end="00:03:37.100" style="s2"> He said, &quot;The line between good and evil runs in the heart of every person.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.560" end="00:03:39.560" style="s2"> So the basic battle</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.560" end="00:03:40.060" style="s2"> According to what I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.140" end="00:03:45.220" style="s2"> This falls within the tradition that put &quot;John Stuart Mill.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.180" end="00:03:48.180" style="s2"> It is &quot;to overcome tyranny and hatred.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:52.420" style="s2"> Anarchy, nihilism, desire and urging everything to stop</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.440" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2"> You have to repair the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:03:57.340" style="s2"> And cracks</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.340" end="00:03:58.680" style="s2"> In your soul, simply</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.980" end="00:04:00.980" style="s2"> And that means you have to face</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2"> The evil that inhabits your heart</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.620" end="00:04:05.620" style="s2"> A statement from the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.960" end="00:04:08.520" style="s2"> Which in my opinion fits with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.620" end="00:04:13.620" style="s2"> This is part of &quot;Sermon on the Mount.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.500" end="00:04:16.920" style="s2"> It is a central text in the Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.920" end="00:04:19.080" style="s2"> And clearly the central text of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.360" end="00:04:22.200" style="s2"> But it is central to everything built by Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:24.860" style="s2"> And in it, Christ addresses his followers</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.880" end="00:04:27.880" style="s2"> Why are you looking at the moth?</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.880" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2"> Which is in your brother&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.480" end="00:04:32.780" style="s2"> As for the plank in your eyes, do not notice it?</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.420" end="00:04:35.420" style="s2"> Or how do you say to your brother;</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.420" end="00:04:37.260" style="s2"> Let me get the speck out of your eye</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.380" end="00:04:40.380" style="s2"> And here is the wood in your eye?</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:44.500" style="s2"> You hypocrite, first get the plank out of your eye</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:48.940" style="s2"> And at that time you will see well to get the speck out of your brother&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.240" end="00:04:51.240" style="s2"> I like this quote</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.240" end="00:04:53.180" style="s2"> Because he places the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.640" end="00:04:55.640" style="s2"> For a change in every stage of existence</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.640" end="00:04:57.420" style="s2"> On the individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.120" end="00:05:00.120" style="s2"> It is clear that the individual interacts with society</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.120" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2"> But the idea is here</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2"> Unless the individual did</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:04.120" style="s2"> Straighten his soul</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2"> There is no possibility of impact</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:08.640" style="s2"> Which the individual will leave on society</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.640" end="00:05:10.280" style="s2"> Only to be something other than harmful</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.600" end="00:05:12.600" style="s2"> The same amount of harm that still exists in the soul</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.600" end="00:05:14.120" style="s2"> These are important things to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.120" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2"> These are very important things to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.060" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2"> But then we face the conundrum that young people, too, want to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:22.420" style="s2"> But this is not a problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.420" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2"> Because I think you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.260" end="00:05:26.260" style="s2"> Bring the &quot;University of Truth&quot; alike with desire</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.260" end="00:05:28.840" style="s2"> To make a real change</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.140" end="00:05:32.060" style="s2"> But change has to start from the right start</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.060" end="00:05:33.720" style="s2"> So I&#39;ll tell you how I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:36.500" style="s2"> You have to change yourselves in order to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.500" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2"> And so the world that you bring into being is the best, not the worst</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:41.500" style="s2"> Remember</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.700" end="00:05:43.700" style="s2"> You have to know this</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.220" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2"> The world that Marx’s followers brought into existence in the twentieth century</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:49.240" style="s2"> More than a hundred million people were killed</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.240" end="00:05:50.900" style="s2"> In China and Russia</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:55.100" style="s2"> I mean the Soviet Union and regions like Cambodia and Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.420" end="00:05:58.220" style="s2"> Of course the world has changed as a result of the Marxist dogma</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.220" end="00:05:59.940" style="s2"> But he did not change in the good path</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.940" end="00:06:01.400" style="s2"> And, of course, the Marxist faith</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2"> It makes itself heard</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:04.320" style="s2"> In a colossal way</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.320" end="00:06:06.280" style="s2"> Again across the west now</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.280" end="00:06:08.160" style="s2"> So what do you have to do about it?</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2"> Take this idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2"> The first thing you have to do is direct yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.200" end="00:06:16.200" style="s2"> Most of you have probably seen the movie &quot;Pinocchio.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.520" end="00:06:18.520" style="s2"> And &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is about a doll</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.020" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2"> Its strands are attracted by forces outside of its absorption</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.780" end="00:06:24.780" style="s2"> This is the position of the immature individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.340" end="00:06:27.860" style="s2"> Gibto is a good father</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.360" end="00:06:31.300" style="s2"> It represents the symbol of good, &quot;the symbol of a beneficial / good civilization.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2"> He makes a doll to be his son</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.780" end="00:06:35.780" style="s2"> And then he makes a wish from the star</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.780" end="00:06:37.560" style="s2"> A star is something that shines in the sky</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.200" end="00:06:41.720" style="s2"> It is linked to the transcendent, the backward and the divine</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:43.480" style="s2"> If you look at the sky at night</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.480" end="00:06:44.660" style="s2"> The place was very dark</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.660" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2"> You feel dread</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.660" end="00:06:47.660" style="s2"> Because you face your souls</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.880" end="00:06:50.020" style="s2"> So to speak, &quot;your individual soul faces the universe.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.180" end="00:06:52.180" style="s2"> And you can feel the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.220" end="00:06:54.220" style="s2"> Between you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.220" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2"> the college</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:56.280" style="s2"> So looking at the sky</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.280" end="00:06:58.140" style="s2"> It is more like a religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.140" end="00:06:59.480" style="s2"> If a sky is full of stars</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.480" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2"> He asked for a wish from the star</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.560" end="00:07:03.560" style="s2"> It is finding the light that guides you</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.560" end="00:07:04.620" style="s2"> As the North Star</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.620" end="00:07:06.580" style="s2"> Let us seek the ultimate goal</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.580" end="00:07:08.040" style="s2"> To seek the ultimate goal that you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.040" end="00:07:09.640" style="s2"> This is what Gpeto does.</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.640" end="00:07:11.640" style="s2"> He raises his eyes</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.640" end="00:07:13.460" style="s2"> About his daily concerns</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.460" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2"> He tries to establish a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:17.180" style="s2"> With the highest possible values</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.020" end="00:07:22.020" style="s2"> It also has the deepest wishes</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.020" end="00:07:23.400" style="s2"> And the most deepest wishes</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.400" end="00:07:24.740" style="s2"> Is that the doll he made</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.600" end="00:07:27.600" style="s2"> You may turn out to be a real individual</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.920" end="00:07:29.920" style="s2"> Real and complete as a mature human</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.920" end="00:07:31.560" style="s2"> This is what you can wish for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.720" end="00:07:33.720" style="s2"> You can wish</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.720" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2"> And seek it in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.920" end="00:07:37.920" style="s2"> This way you deal with suffering</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.920" end="00:07:39.200" style="s2"> That are present in life</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.200" end="00:07:40.300" style="s2"> Because life is suffering</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.300" end="00:07:41.860" style="s2"> And because life is very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.860" end="00:07:43.380" style="s2"> People may get sick</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.380" end="00:07:44.780" style="s2"> And they become mentally ill</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.160" end="00:07:47.160" style="s2"> And there is malice in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.160" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2"> And there are misfortunes</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:49.860" style="s2"> This is why life is very, very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.100" end="00:07:52.100" style="s2"> If it is not oriented correctly</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.100" end="00:07:52.840" style="s2"> With regard to life</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.840" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2"> The fact that it is difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:55.580" style="s2"> And it is full of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.140" end="00:07:58.140" style="s2"> Because that may divert you, woe and tie you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.140" end="00:07:59.540" style="s2"> Until you become a thug</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.540" end="00:08:00.060" style="s2"> And malevolent</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2"> And it may become more than shedding and hatred</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:04.520" style="s2"> To wish massacres</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.520" end="00:08:06.420" style="s2"> And even that you wish everything destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.660" end="00:08:15.100" style="s2"> Therefore, you must learn to strengthen yourself as an individual so that you can bear the burden of existence without being corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2"> You have to decide that this is what you are seeking</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:19.320" style="s2"> You want to be a fully fledged human being</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.880" end="00:08:21.880" style="s2"> And you stop being a pathetic doll</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.340" end="00:08:24.880" style="s2"> Their leads are attracted by terrible forces behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.340" end="00:08:28.340" style="s2"> To wish the star</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.340" end="00:08:29.560" style="s2"> It is to strive for the supreme good</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.560" end="00:08:30.980" style="s2"> The question then is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.980" end="00:08:32.200" style="s2"> What is good?</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.340" end="00:08:35.340" style="s2"> We can answer this in two ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.860" end="00:08:37.860" style="s2"> We can say that good is the opposite of evil</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.860" end="00:08:39.660" style="s2"> And I can tell you what evil is</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.480" end="00:08:43.260" style="s2"> Evil is the conscious desire to achieve suffering</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.260" end="00:08:45.300" style="s2"> When suffering is not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.720" end="00:08:47.720" style="s2"> If you read about what happened</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.720" end="00:08:48.680" style="s2"> In the Nazi concentration camps</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.680" end="00:08:49.580" style="s2"> For example</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.920" end="00:08:53.840" style="s2"> Or in Russian concentration camps in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.260" end="00:08:56.260" style="s2"> You will find what helps you about what constitutes evil</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.960" end="00:08:59.940" style="s2"> Evil is the desire to take advantage of the weakness of others</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.180" end="00:09:02.820" style="s2"> To take advantage of others&#39; weaknesses with self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.280" end="00:09:05.820" style="s2"> And to escalate their suffering beyond their endurance</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2"> So the good is the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:10.020" style="s2"> Whatever the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.020" end="00:09:11.640" style="s2"> Goodness blinds its explanation</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2"> But here is one hint</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:15.160" style="s2"> And I understood this by reading &quot;John Piguet&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.180" end="00:09:17.180" style="s2"> Developmental Psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.340" end="00:09:21.640" style="s2"> Piguet spoke of the &quot;standard phase.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:24.120" style="s2"> The &quot;standard stage&quot; is like a game that children play</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.260" end="00:09:26.260" style="s2"> And in it every child wants to play the game</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.260" end="00:09:29.000" style="s2"> You have a small social group and this is the children&#39;s play group</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:31.520" style="s2"> And the individuals who are in it</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.520" end="00:09:33.020" style="s2"> These are individual children</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.020" end="00:09:34.260" style="s2"> And structure is the game</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.960" end="00:09:37.500" style="s2"> And it&#39;s a good game if everyone wants to play it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.440" end="00:09:40.440" style="s2"> Bigger is not lucky to have a game like this</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.060" end="00:09:44.120" style="s2"> You will beat a game that tyrannizes people to play</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.680" end="00:09:47.520" style="s2"> Because it does not entail a forced application of costs</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.640" end="00:09:51.640" style="s2"> So the idea of ​​the &quot;standard stage&quot; was developed.</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.640" end="00:09:52.740" style="s2"> To think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.220" end="00:09:55.220" style="s2"> If you seek good</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.220" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2"> You want what is best for you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.700" end="00:09:59.700" style="s2"> And I mean fine to you as if you are taking care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:03.000" style="s2"> Or treat yourself like someone you love</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.360" end="00:10:06.360" style="s2"> Which will be good for you and your family too</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.580" end="00:10:11.480" style="s2"> Which in turn will be good for you, for your family, and for the community</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.060" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2"> So it will be good for you, for your family, for society, and then for the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.640" end="00:10:19.640" style="s2"> Then it will be good for now</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.640" end="00:10:21.160" style="s2"> Then it will be okay for next week</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.160" end="00:10:21.860" style="s2"> And the week after that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.860" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2"> And a year from now</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2"> And even the future as you can see</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.140" end="00:10:27.140" style="s2"> So the goodness is something that balances out</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.780" end="00:10:29.780" style="s2"> Between multiple stages of existence</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.780" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2"> In multiple time frames at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.940" end="00:10:33.940" style="s2"> You don&#39;t have to know</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.940" end="00:10:35.720" style="s2"> What will happen from this at any moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.720" end="00:10:36.700" style="s2"> But you can direct yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.300" end="00:10:39.300" style="s2"> That this is the state you want to be in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.300" end="00:10:40.040" style="s2"> And I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.040" end="00:10:41.700" style="s2"> As far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.700" end="00:10:43.460" style="s2"> When in this state</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2"> Even if moment by moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.420" end="00:10:48.420" style="s2"> Your life is saturated with a sense of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.420" end="00:10:49.300" style="s2"> This sense of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.620" end="00:10:51.620" style="s2"> It helps you to stand up from the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.620" end="00:10:53.280" style="s2"> The philosopher &quot;Nietzsche&quot; says:</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.520" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2"> &quot;A person who lives for a purpose can endure anyway.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.300" end="00:11:01.300" style="s2"> So the idea of ​​&quot;Nietzsche&quot; was</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.300" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2"> If there is a purpose for your life</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:04.580" style="s2"> Nobly enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.160" end="00:11:08.620" style="s2"> It&#39;s not just that suffering in life is acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.420" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2"> But it may also be commendable</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.540" end="00:11:15.020" style="s2"> You may be ready to bear the burden of existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.500" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2"> Because of the exciting things you can do with existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.160" end="00:11:21.160" style="s2"> Things that you can build and achieve</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2"> This may be the highest imaginative state of existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:25.800" style="s2"> This is a form of paradise</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.360" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2"> But it is not the paradise that you attain by changing others</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2"> But it is the paradise that you attain</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:31.980" style="s2"> By changing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2"> This is a difficult thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:35.640" style="s2"> It&#39;s scary to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.640" end="00:11:36.760" style="s2"> Because it means</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.900" end="00:11:38.900" style="s2"> That you are reshaping your soul</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2"> This is a task for someone who is truly honest and noble</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:46.840" style="s2"> It&#39;s interesting enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:48.860" style="s2"> To keep you occupied for the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.860" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2"> And then magic things will happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:51.900" style="s2"> While doing it</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.180" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2"> And the world will be around you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:11:55.240" style="s2"> In a more amazing way</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.240" end="00:11:55.980" style="s2"> Musically</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.300" end="00:11:58.300" style="s2"> So that every part of what you live</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.280" end="00:12:01.460" style="s2"> He plays against every other part</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:05.020" style="s2"> In a way that is deeply meaningful from every aspect in it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.460" end="00:12:07.460" style="s2"> By the way, you are experiencing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.460" end="00:12:09.420" style="s2"> When you listen to a piece of music you love</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.420" end="00:12:10.640" style="s2"> Music represents that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.100" end="00:12:13.100" style="s2"> Because music nourishes the soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.220" end="00:12:15.220" style="s2"> And because it is the highest form of art</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.220" end="00:12:16.820" style="s2"> At least from my point of view</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.820" end="00:12:18.180" style="s2"> So you have to live your life</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.180" end="00:12:18.680" style="s2"> As if</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.680" end="00:12:20.180" style="s2"> Existence is a symphony</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.400" end="00:12:23.640" style="s2"> And you are playing the part of your track</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.180" end="00:12:49.180" style="s2"> Once you direct yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.180" end="00:12:50.680" style="s2"> So you have commitment</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.760" end="00:12:52.760" style="s2"> A commitment to developing your soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.760" end="00:12:53.740" style="s2"> To speak the truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.740" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2"> However, you have to be properly oriented</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:12:56.900" style="s2"> Because the truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.520" end="00:12:59.520" style="s2"> Something exists as an interest for an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.520" end="00:13:00.460" style="s2"> Like a top of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.920" end="00:13:02.920" style="s2"> Then you can imagine that you are using your language in two ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.920" end="00:13:04.540" style="s2"> You can use your language to manipulate the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.800" end="00:13:07.780" style="s2"> And get what you want from it</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.780" end="00:13:08.280" style="s2"> As an example</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.400" end="00:13:10.400" style="s2"> Maybe go out on a date with someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.400" end="00:13:12.020" style="s2"> It was decided that the final goal of it was the date</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2"> Is that you get a partner to have sex tonight</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:15.780" style="s2"> Then you can configure your language</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2"> To influence the person until he saves you</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:19.380" style="s2"> What you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.900" end="00:13:21.900" style="s2"> This is a manual use of language</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.900" end="00:13:22.860" style="s2"> But</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.860" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2"> The problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:25.300" style="s2"> There are several problems with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.300" end="00:13:25.800" style="s2"> But one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.640" end="00:13:28.640" style="s2"> What if your idea of ​​what to seek is wrong?</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.740" end="00:13:30.740" style="s2"> Perhaps that is not the way it should be treated</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.760" end="00:13:32.760" style="s2"> The person you are on a date with</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.660" end="00:13:35.700" style="s2"> Maybe you reduce or decrease</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.120" end="00:13:38.120" style="s2"> The interactions between you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.120" end="00:13:39.660" style="s2"> Than it may be</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.940" end="00:13:41.940" style="s2"> health condition</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.940" end="00:13:43.180" style="s2"> And thin</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.180" end="00:13:45.080" style="s2"> Of interaction and dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.080" end="00:13:45.860" style="s2"> To something</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.160" end="00:13:49.160" style="s2"> Simply the pursuit of impulsive pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.540" end="00:13:51.540" style="s2"> And maybe that is not good for you</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.540" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2"> For the next week and the next</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:54.340" style="s2"> And next month</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.340" end="00:13:57.260" style="s2"> Directing yourself to impulsive pleasures can be a very bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.620" end="00:13:59.620" style="s2"> Remember what happened in Pinocchio.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.620" end="00:14:01.480" style="s2"> Pinocchio goes to the island of pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.480" end="00:14:06.580" style="s2"> And the island of pleasures is a place where he gets impulsive pleasures at the same moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.580" end="00:14:08.980" style="s2"> But what Pinocchio discovers with Jimny, the night cockroach</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.000" end="00:14:13.800" style="s2"> That the island of pleasure is governed by two masked tyrants</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.800" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2"> They all wear black</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:20.060" style="s2"> All of you remember that they are transforming the kids and teens on the island of Pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.060" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2"> They deny them their voices by turning them into the minds of donkeys</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.840" end="00:14:26.520" style="s2"> And preparing to sell them as slaves to the salt mines</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.520" end="00:14:30.680" style="s2"> So there is an implication in the story that the pursuit of impulsive pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.680" end="00:14:34.080" style="s2"> It is one of the paths of totalitarianism and slavery</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.080" end="00:14:35.260" style="s2"> And I believe in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.700" end="00:14:39.700" style="s2"> So the possibility of directing your language towards the attainment of impulsive pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.540" end="00:14:43.740" style="s2"> It is a misuse of your highest gift</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.060" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2"> The gift of slogans, the gift of communication</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.040" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2"> The alternative is to direct yourself to the ultimate good, as we explained earlier</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:51.300" style="s2"> And then speak the truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.300" end="00:14:55.340" style="s2"> You can know that you are doing it or you can know that you are not</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.480" end="00:14:57.480" style="s2"> Because if you are not speaking the truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.480" end="00:14:58.840" style="s2"> And you were using someone else&#39;s words</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.020" end="00:15:03.220" style="s2"> You are being deceived by meaning by behind-the-scenes forces</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.220" end="00:15:04.820" style="s2"> You don&#39;t use your own words</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.820" end="00:15:10.520" style="s2"> You are the puppet of an ideology, another thinker, or of your impulsive desires</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.520" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2"> And you can know when you speak that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.140" end="00:15:15.380" style="s2"> Because it makes you feel weak and ashamed</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:17.940" style="s2"> And you can determine this feeling physiologically</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.940" end="00:15:19.700" style="s2"> If you listen to yourself while you speak</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.660" end="00:15:26.680" style="s2"> You can know when you speak the right way that you will experience a feeling of inclusion and strength</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.680" end="00:15:29.880" style="s2"> And when you speak in a misleading or manipulative way</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.880" end="00:15:32.920" style="s2"> Feel like you are falling apart in layers</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.920" end="00:15:36.840" style="s2"> What you need to do is practice only saying the things that make you feel stronger</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.000" end="00:15:41.000" style="s2"> This will mean from the start that you will notice that most of what you are saying is a lie</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.000" end="00:15:43.380" style="s2"> It is either a lie or someone else&#39;s words</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.380" end="00:15:48.040" style="s2"> It is very difficult to find your own words, but you do not really exist until you find your own</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.460" end="00:15:53.460" style="s2"> Then you try to teach yourself how to speak your own truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.460" end="00:15:55.380" style="s2"> You listen to other people while you do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.740" end="00:15:58.540" style="s2"> Because they can help you shape and correct your words</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.780" end="00:16:02.120" style="s2"> They will react poorly to it if your thoughts are poorly worded</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.120" end="00:16:05.380" style="s2"> If you listen and pay attention then you will know how to formulate your words</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.380" end="00:16:07.140" style="s2"> In a more clear and accurate way</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.140" end="00:16:08.540" style="s2"> And that makes you more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.900" end="00:16:14.300" style="s2"> It gives you more power which is one of the benefits of forms of strength</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.840" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2"> So you do it and then you have to make the decision to believe</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.420" end="00:16:23.980" style="s2"> And that is simply either to use your language to manipulate the world and make it achieve what you want</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.480" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2"> Or, use your language to try to pronounce the truth as carefully as possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.200" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2"> Then you can see what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:37.020" style="s2"> You have to give up your desire for the sake of the consequences you want</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.240" end="00:16:39.240" style="s2"> You have to assume that if he talks to you the truth</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.220" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2"> The results are the best possible under the circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.820" end="00:16:46.460" style="s2"> It&#39;s an exciting way to live in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.260" end="00:16:50.580" style="s2"> It&#39;s like walking down a cliff because you don&#39;t know what will happen next</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.920" end="00:16:52.980" style="s2"> If all you do is say what you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.520" end="00:16:55.520" style="s2"> You might be at work, say what you think, and then get fired</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.520" end="00:16:57.840" style="s2"> Then she says, &quot;Oh my God what a terrible misfortune.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.400" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2"> But maybe it&#39;s not like that because maybe if you worked in a place and you had to lie in order to keep your job</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2"> You probably shouldn&#39;t be there</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:07.260" style="s2"> Maybe your soul will die and destroy you</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.260" end="00:17:09.860" style="s2"> Permanently and make you spoiled</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.420" end="00:17:14.840" style="s2"> Therefore, you must guide yourself and speak the truth as carefully as you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.220" end="00:17:17.480" style="s2"> You have to listen to others in order to correct your speech</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.140" end="00:17:23.080" style="s2"> Then you have to allow the consequences to unfold as they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.080" end="00:17:24.840" style="s2"> This is the ultimate act of faith</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.220" end="00:17:27.500" style="s2"> This is what you do if you belong to the &quot;University of Truth.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:31.980" style="s2"> With a more practical speech, then you have to educate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.980" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2"> And that&#39;s not easy work now</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.900" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2"> Because you have to find people who can really tell you what to read</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:42.980" style="s2"> And maybe also how to write because writing is a way of expressing your thoughts more precisely</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.000" end="00:17:45.000" style="s2"> That&#39;s why you go to college to learn how to write</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.460" end="00:17:47.660" style="s2"> If you know how to write then you will be able to think</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.220" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2"> If you can think, speak and communicate write</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.040" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2"> Then you are incredibly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.400" end="00:17:55.400" style="s2"> According to the authority level</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.200" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2"> Because the arguments are moving the world forward</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.680" end="00:18:03.580" style="s2"> If your arguments are coherent, well-structured, clear, and well-adjusted</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.580" end="00:18:04.840" style="s2"> And analyzed carefully</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.840" end="00:18:06.920" style="s2"> And you have five displays of logic for everything you do</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.080" end="00:18:09.160" style="s2"> This is what will happen if you learn how to write correctly</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:11.240" style="s2"> Then you are a force of nature, man</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.240" end="00:18:12.660" style="s2"> No one can defeat you</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.380" end="00:18:15.380" style="s2"> This is one of the things that are not taught to people</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.380" end="00:18:17.260" style="s2"> Why go to learn, especially in the humanities</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.300" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2"> Teaching &quot;humanities&quot; if real, organizes the basics of your mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.760" end="00:18:26.920" style="s2"> He drops you to the ground, puts you on a rock, and makes you a strength to fight</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.920" end="00:18:28.820" style="s2"> But you have to read for the right people</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:33.620" style="s2"> These are the great people of the past on my list</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.220" end="00:18:36.740" style="s2"> These are the greatest men of the past, and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.080" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2"> I suggested these and made two lists to read on &quot;Jordanbpeterson.com&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.900" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2"> And the people whose books I suggested in the first place were written before</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2"> Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy who, in my opinion, is the greatest novelist the world has known</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.660" end="00:19:01.580" style="s2"> Alexander Solzhenitsyn is another great Russian novelist, and I don’t know what the Russians’s story is about, but man, they are producing a book like no other.</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.280" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2"> Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote a book called &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; in which he analyzed the Soviet prison system of detention centers that emerged after the Leninist revolution in the second century of the twentieth century.</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.800" end="00:19:21.300" style="s2"> He detailed, with great precision, how the Marxist principles that had to liberate everyone and change the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:25.620" style="s2"> It produced legislation that was completely deadly in its consequences</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.680" end="00:19:35.020" style="s2"> Solzhenitsyn carefully traces the logical path from original Marxist principles to legislation and even genocide.</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:44.800" style="s2"> Because you will hear people who are simply Marxists who will say something like &quot;True Marxism did not exist&quot; and &quot;Solzhenitsyn&quot; made this argument separately in the mid-1970s.</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.500" end="00:19:53.940" style="s2"> And the &quot;Gulag Archipelago&quot; was an ideological bomb that destroyed all the credibility of Marxism for intellectual respect.</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.380" end="00:20:03.060" style="s2"> You have to read the book. The book contains the central problem that is in our culture today. If you do not read it, you are not informed and you can only participate in the discussion as a doll.</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.860" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2"> So I will not suggest participating in the discussion as a puppet because you do not know behind the scenes and he pulls strings if you remember the story of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.180" end="00:20:18.380" style="s2"> The forces that were pulling the strings were not forces working in the best interest of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. This is for sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.240" end="00:20:26.520" style="s2"> Guruj Uriel is an English essay writer and unparalleled commentator on socialist totalitarianism even though he is a leftist and an innovator.</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.940" end="00:20:36.800" style="s2"> Aldous Huxley wrote &quot;Brave New World&quot; and I have wonderful things to say about the potential devastation of sexual choice and sexual partner selection as part of a dystopian future.</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.400" end="00:20:48.120" style="s2"> Friedrich Nietzsche is a philosopher who describes himself as a person who thought of a hammer, and Nietzsche is a very, very dangerous person, and a really clever writer.</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.380" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2"> And Karl Jung, who was a student of Nietzsche, and Nietzsche is the philosopher who announced the death of God earlier in the late 1800&#39;s, and Jung spent his entire life trying to resurrect the Lord, and this is one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.800" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2"> Educate yourself This is a good way to start. If you are reading these authors then you will know what to read as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.760" end="00:21:12.200" style="s2"> If you read to these authors it will take you a long time and it will be very, very difficult for you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.760" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2"> And you will not be the same person when you get out of it and this is very, very terrifying to be torn and rebuilt is not a joke, but it strongly overcomes the alternative.</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:28.760" style="s2"> Which just means being sluggish and being a sluggish baby is something I wouldn&#39;t recommend</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.760" end="00:21:32.700" style="s2"> Nothing is worse than a stagnant forty baby</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.020" end="00:21:39.320" style="s2"> So that&#39;s just the equivalent of your information to Pinocchio. We go back to the story of Pinocchio when he saves Gibto from the underworld.</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.500" end="00:21:48.940" style="s2"> You remember when he was turned into a half-donkey after he was on &quot;The Island of Pleasure,&quot; he was seduced by two people, the fox and the cat.</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.220" end="00:21:54.140" style="s2"> And those who tried to seduce him into believing that he was a victim and that he needed leave</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.980" end="00:22:06.920" style="s2"> Therefore, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was seduced to &quot;The Island of Pleasures&quot; by two characters who played with his victim feeling, his nerves and his suffering to convince him that he should not bear any responsibility for his existence.</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:13.040" style="s2"> And that he can occupy himself with his impulsive pleasures, and in this way he fell into the hands of tyrants on the &quot;island of pleasures.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.380" end="00:22:20.040" style="s2"> However, after Pinocchio left the Island of Pleasure, he had to head to the beach twice</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.040" end="00:22:23.240" style="s2"> The second time he headed to the beach, he was looking for his father</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.520" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2"> A father to anyone, according to the mythical perspective, dies in the underworld in chaos because everyone inherits a sick and ancient civilization, so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.000" end="00:22:41.160" style="s2"> It is sick and old because it was formed by the dead and the living must resurrect it continuously until it becomes a controlling force</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:48.520" style="s2"> And the living have to resurrect their connection with civilization internally as well, because your structure is from civilization, even though not only the structures of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.800" end="00:22:53.620" style="s2"> You have to understand history, otherwise you will not understand yourself, for you are a historical being</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.100" end="00:22:57.780" style="s2"> So you have to save your dead father from the belly of the beast from the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.920" end="00:23:01.400" style="s2"> Because if you remember that the whale in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is also a fire-breathing dragon</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.040" end="00:23:07.780" style="s2"> This means that you have to face your most feared fear and when you do then you will save your father from the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.820" end="00:23:20.460" style="s2"> These are very complex ideas, and you can read about them in my book, &quot;Maps of Meaning&quot;. If you want in the reading list, put a free copy, you can on the &quot;Jordanbpeterson.com&quot; website, where I talk in detail about these matters.</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.000" end="00:23:24.820" style="s2"> However, you have to resurrect your father before you can be real</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.480" end="00:23:32.840" style="s2"> This is one of the problems with feminism and the social justice fighter by their insistence on the existence of a patriarchal society</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.320" end="00:23:39.860" style="s2"> Everyone knows since the beginning of history that civilization is corrupt and tyrannical, but at the same time it is protective and beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2"> Even the language you use is part of civilization. You do not bring down patriarchal society, but revive your civilization</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.000" end="00:23:52.180" style="s2"> And you do this by taking responsibility for your own existence and then acting as a moral agent in civilization</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.940" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2"> This is what you do to become an educated person. Read these books, they will change your life. I guarantee that they will change your life.</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:04.540" style="s2"> They will destroy you, destroy you, and then rebuild you for something higher than you are now</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.540" end="00:24:06.240" style="s2"> Harry, you are in pain.</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:07.640" style="s2"> do not worry</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.360" end="00:24:10.920" style="s2"> Jenny, you need to find a way out</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.140" end="00:24:14.280" style="s2"> Follow the hall and you will find Ron</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:29.460" style="s2"> You are a genius, Foxes</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.380" end="00:24:32.380" style="s2"> I wasn&#39;t just fast enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2"> Sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.020" end="00:24:58.020" style="s2"> Phoenix tears have healing powers</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.040" end="00:25:02.040" style="s2"> Thank you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.380" end="00:25:05.380" style="s2"> It&#39;s all right, Jenny</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.360" end="00:25:08.360" style="s2"> This is what it seeks</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:10.740" style="s2"> This will help</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.740" end="00:25:15.500" style="s2"> Colleagues and I have developed a series of online writing programs entitled &quot;The Self authring sweet&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.220" end="00:25:21.640" style="s2"> It helps people to write about, organize, and understand their past and present personality</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.660" end="00:25:28.920" style="s2"> Then the Future and the Future Composition Program asks you to write about six different dimensions of your life</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.060" end="00:25:37.280" style="s2"> So he asks you first to treat yourself as someone you want to help, someone you love and care about, and someone you want to help</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.280" end="00:25:42.820" style="s2"> Then he asks if you can organize your life in the best possible way</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.820" end="00:25:44.900" style="s2"> Along with the principles we discussed earlier</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.420" end="00:25:48.700" style="s2"> what do you want? What do you want for your profession?</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:50.340" style="s2"> What do you really want?</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.580" end="00:25:52.700" style="s2"> What will make your life valuable? What do you want for your profession?</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.160" end="00:25:56.440" style="s2"> What do you want for your family? And from your family? What do you want from an intimate relationship?</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.940" end="00:26:03.460" style="s2"> How will you take care of your physical and mental health? How will you deal with the use of alcohol and drugs?</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.860" end="00:26:06.100" style="s2"> It asks you a series of basic questions like these</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.460" end="00:26:07.820" style="s2"> To move your mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.460" end="00:26:13.500" style="s2"> Then he asks you to write for 15 minutes about what your life might be like in three or five years into the future</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.480" end="00:26:25.820" style="s2"> If it results as if you are drawing the life of someone you deeply care about, then you are required to write about it for 15 minutes without worrying about the structure of the argument or any grammatical checks.</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.340" end="00:26:28.340" style="s2"> That postpones until later</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.660" end="00:26:30.260" style="s2"> So it gives you a simple paradise to strive for</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.800" end="00:26:35.920" style="s2"> Like saying, &quot;Well if I can have that then my life will be worth the trouble, even if I have to struggle for a reasonable time along the way.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.440" end="00:26:40.440" style="s2"> This is what you are trying to build, and you can think of it as a paradise worth moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.000" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2"> The second part of the program asks you to write about what your life could be like in the next three to five years if all of your bad habits and nihilistic tendencies were.</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.040" end="00:26:58.040" style="s2"> And your tendencies towards resentment and loss of desire to take responsibility if all your weaknesses take control and knock you down</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.860" end="00:27:05.480" style="s2"> And everyone knows that.You know what it would be like if you let everything slip and know what hell you&#39;d be headed towards</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.180" end="00:27:13.100" style="s2"> So the second part of the program asks you to write about what your life might be like over the next three to five years if everything around you ended up in hell.</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.420" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2"> So it gives you a hell to avoid and a paradise to look towards</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.800" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2"> And you need both because that is what keeps you properly motivated in life</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.760" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2"> Then, the second half of the program, which represents the next section of the program, helps you transform your vision for the desired future into an achievable reality.</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:33.980" style="s2"> And its word complementarity and the pronunciation of arguments for why you want it</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.520" end="00:27:38.220" style="s2"> It also helps you overcome your own doubts because you don&#39;t have to argue against other people only</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.380" end="00:27:47.060" style="s2"> It means arguing against the gossip of the demons of nihilism, despair, and ideological monarchy that exist within your mind and society at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.680" end="00:27:49.920" style="s2"> You need powerful weapons to fight against them</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.860" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2"> And here is this offer. We have made a free &quot;future authoring program&quot; available for the next period. I don&#39;t know how long the period will be, but let&#39;s assume a week or something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.380" end="00:28:09.880" style="s2"> If you go to ((the address is written in the picture))</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.040" end="00:28:20.560" style="s2"> You can read about the program there, and now I have to tell you that we have used this program on about 5,000 university students, most of them in the Netherlands but some in Canada as well.</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:31.040" style="s2"> And what we showed is that if you complete the program, even if you do it badly, and I advise, &quot;Do it badly, man&quot; it doesn&#39;t matter that you do it in an excellent way.</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.380" end="00:28:34.440" style="s2"> Do it badly and maybe later you can do better as you progress, but at least it does badly</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.240" end="00:28:43.580" style="s2"> This program increases the performance of university students, increases their grades between 20 to 25 percent and reduces their withdrawal from studies by the same percentage.</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.800" end="00:28:51.460" style="s2"> So we have a statistic of 5,000 people and one of these articles has been published and I will link to it in the description of the video</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:56.220" style="s2"> So this program really works if you use it so I highly recommend that you do so</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.500" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2"> In any case, you can read about this program from there and click on buy for 14.95 and then enter this code (changeyouself) * Note that this may be for the offer now ending</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.460" end="00:29:12.540" style="s2"> This is what millennials have to do if they want to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.900" end="00:29:22.760" style="s2"> The first thing they have to do is direct themselves to do good, and this is away from evil, away from hatred, away from vain, pretended suffering, and pain.</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.980" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2"> Or rather let us say far from Auschwitz * a Nazi internment camp in Poland * and away from the &quot;Gulag Archipelago&quot; and the heinous Soviet concentration camps and the mass murder that took place in China</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.180" end="00:29:33.400" style="s2"> So you want to get as far away from it as possible as you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.940" end="00:29:36.700" style="s2"> Any direction away from that is a good trend</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2"> After that, you should think about the highest possible good that may appear to you, your family, and your community, as we have already discussed that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.840" end="00:29:47.660" style="s2"> Then you have to speak the truth as related to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.700" end="00:29:49.700" style="s2"> Then you have to educate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.740" end="00:30:01.460" style="s2"> After that, you have to assume your responsibility, and responsibility is good because it makes you strong under its weight, it makes you strong and enables you to free yourself from your strings.</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.460" end="00:30:05.680" style="s2"> Turn yourself into an honest individual, and then take on the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.680" end="00:30:08.800" style="s2"> And then you&#39;re in a position to make a change</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.800" end="00:30:14.160" style="s2"> As a person like this, your pure existence will change the world in a positive direction</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.420" end="00:30:22.040" style="s2"> This is what you should strive for: Read the books that I have posted on my site. Create a &quot;Creating the Future&quot; program, and this will improve your life greatly</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.040" end="00:30:23.740" style="s2"> In this way, you can change the world</p>
