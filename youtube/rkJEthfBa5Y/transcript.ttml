<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.920" style="s2">this episode is once again an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.970" end="00:00:06.870" style="s2">combine a concept that&#39;s already been</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.920" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">articulated in this case in the medium</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.870" end="00:00:12.990" style="s2">post with the medium of video YouTube -</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:14.160" style="s2">hopefully elucidate the concept more</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.990" end="00:00:16.500" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:17.520" style="s2">this concept is sovereignty and of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">course I&#39;ll go into some detail about</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.520" end="00:00:21.480" style="s2">what I mean by that in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">but those of you who want to delve more</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.480" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">deeply into that concept I will into</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:30.869" style="s2">medium post below so the idea is that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.410" end="00:00:34.380" style="s2">can reconcile as this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.869" end="00:00:36.750" style="s2">sovereignty using a new framework and</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.380" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">the point is that I think that this new</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:40.710" style="s2">framework is a good deep way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">anchoring sovereignty in a more</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.710" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">foundational fashion that is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:48.030" style="s2">to the set of problems that we face</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:49.860" style="s2">today and in point of fact I use this</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.030" end="00:00:52.050" style="s2">concept often involved probably quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.860" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">likely referred to it in other other</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.050" end="00:00:56.910" style="s2">videos so it&#39;s effectively a triadic</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.430" style="s2">structure the notion is there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.910" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">distinct underlying capacities that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">associated with to be sovereign and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">that your sovereignty then represents a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:13.229" style="s2">sort of general purpose capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">respond to the world so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.229" end="00:01:17.369" style="s2">simplest sense of what it means so to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:19.530" style="s2">say that you are our sovereign is to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.369" end="00:01:21.299" style="s2">that within a certain context and in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.530" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">certain set of circumstances you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.299" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">the capacity to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">your circumstances to respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">environmental generator as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">city overwhelmed by it or so you going</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">to react to it etc so this is the core</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">notion but we can actually decompose</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">that and then reconfigure it and bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:42.210" style="s2">it back together in a way that I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">is very powerful very timely in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.210" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">contemporary environment for those of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">you who are familiar with Boyd&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">Duluth which is four points observe</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">orient decide act you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">imagine the three that I&#39;m describing as</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">being the blank space in between and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll reference that it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:02:00.299" style="s2">through it so the first aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">sovereignty is is perception the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.299" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">capacity to receive information from</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">your environment and this particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">capacity has three primary</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:12.690" style="s2">characteristics one you might think of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">as being the modalities of perception so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.690" end="00:02:14.970" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:16.350" style="s2">vision is a different modality than</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.970" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">smell looks was different modality than</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.350" end="00:02:21.030" style="s2">hearing and this distinction modality is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">very important because different</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:24.600" style="s2">modalities of perception have very</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">different qualities there are things</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.600" end="00:02:27.780" style="s2">that you can see that you cannot hear</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">and things you can hear that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.780" end="00:02:33.060" style="s2">see no matter how how much acuity your</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:34.890" style="s2">vision your hearing happen to have and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2">the fact that the reality happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.890" end="00:02:38.450" style="s2">partitioned to that way is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:41.220" style="s2">quite interesting but in any event</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.450" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">modality and the number of modalities</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.220" end="00:02:45.300" style="s2">with which you go about perceiving is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:49.050" style="s2">fundamental characteristic of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.300" end="00:02:51.450" style="s2">underlying capacitive perception another</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.050" end="00:02:52.590" style="s2">one though is bandwidth so so bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.450" end="00:02:55.890" style="s2">has to do with the amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.590" end="00:02:58.110" style="s2">flow you can actually receive through a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.890" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">given modality so this is both in terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.110" end="00:03:01.940" style="s2">of the continuum of the total</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.020" style="s2">possibilities so within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.940" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">electromagnetic spectrum for example but</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.020" end="00:03:09.150" style="s2">what portion of that spectrum can you</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">see and then also the velocity the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.150" end="00:03:12.380" style="s2">actual amount of information flow is</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:15.620" style="s2">coming out to that you could process</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.380" end="00:03:18.170" style="s2">effectively at least 3 perceptual lens</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.620" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">and then the last characteristic is</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.170" end="00:03:24.630" style="s2">subtlety or discernment in perception</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:28.020" style="s2">and this has to do with the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.630" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">not just perceive kind of raw bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.020" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">maybe a little bit of a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:36.060" style="s2">between say a telescope and a microscope</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:37.830" style="s2">where a telescope has a capacity to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">subtlety in the direction of distance a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.830" end="00:03:43.170" style="s2">microscope has the capacity of something</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">in the direction of the very small and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.170" end="00:03:47.550" style="s2">so those are obviously two very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:50.310" style="s2">different capacities within what may be</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.550" end="00:03:53.490" style="s2">the same bandwidth in the same room down</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.310" end="00:03:55.470" style="s2">on the vision and then all of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.490" end="00:03:58.470" style="s2">perceptions in the context of overwhelm</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.470" end="00:04:00.360" style="s2">because while your instruments of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.470" end="00:04:01.890" style="s2">perception have certain capacities to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.360" end="00:04:04.620" style="s2">perceive they also have certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.890" end="00:04:05.940" style="s2">thresholds after which the capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.620" end="00:04:07.950" style="s2">selflessly crazy so you&#39;ve got sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.940" end="00:04:11.330" style="s2">an upper limit of what you can perceive</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.950" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">but then you also have a degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.330" end="00:04:16.020" style="s2">signals outside of that limit actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:18.989" style="s2">degraded capacity so if you listen to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.020" end="00:04:20.520" style="s2">loud noise you then lose your hearing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.989" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">capacity for some period of time or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.520" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">flash of light makes it harder to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:26.760" style="s2">for some period of time and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">that agreed to it you were able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.760" end="00:04:30.060" style="s2">increase modality increase bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.640" style="s2">increase subtlety and increase your</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.060" end="00:04:34.380" style="s2">capacity to perceive without being</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.640" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">overwhelmed you then increase this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.380" end="00:04:40.530" style="s2">dimension of Socrates&#39;s the precession</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:42.150" style="s2">dimension of sovereignty and then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.530" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">have the the second dimension which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.150" end="00:04:47.010" style="s2">the dimension perhaps of processing or</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:51.930" style="s2">intelligence and the handoff between the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.010" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">two is the dimension of sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.930" end="00:04:56.310" style="s2">so in the second category we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:59.250" style="s2">about an ability to take perception to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.310" end="00:05:01.230" style="s2">convert it into meaning and again this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.250" end="00:05:03.330" style="s2">has number of characteristics you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.230" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">things like your RAW processing speed</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.330" end="00:05:08.550" style="s2">how much information can you take in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">convert it maybe that you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.550" end="00:05:14.010" style="s2">overwhelmed at the level of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:16.970" style="s2">not at the level of perception but also</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.010" end="00:05:19.470" style="s2">other things that map a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.970" end="00:05:22.610" style="s2">modality and bandwidth and subtlety for</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.470" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">example your capacity to develop</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.610" end="00:05:27.000" style="s2">frameworks of that abstraction so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:29.270" style="s2">you can actually take large amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.000" end="00:05:31.890" style="s2">raw information and decompose it into</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.270" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">structures and patterns and models you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.890" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">model incapacity is a component of of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.550" end="00:05:39.150" style="s2">intelligence or processing and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">pattern recognition you&#39;re deleted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.150" end="00:05:44.990" style="s2">notice and detect pattern because you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:47.730" style="s2">even compress and use as objects that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.990" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">you can plug into your model so these</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.730" end="00:05:53.790" style="s2">are all aspects of intelligence and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:56.070" style="s2">that&#39;s also important to recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.790" end="00:06:01.110" style="s2">feedback between the two modes or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.070" end="00:06:03.140" style="s2">two domains so you have a inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.110" end="00:06:05.550" style="s2">level if you have a hearing and vision</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.140" end="00:06:07.200" style="s2">modality of perception you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.550" end="00:06:09.650" style="s2">need to have a hearing and vision</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.200" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">processing capacity and then also</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.650" end="00:06:14.430" style="s2">broadly speaking you&#39;ll need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:16.290" style="s2">binding capacity which is to to compare</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.430" end="00:06:19.890" style="s2">the inputs from those two different</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.650" end="00:06:37.530" style="s2">is going from making sense of your</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:12.430" style="s2">Gentek portion of this triad so your</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.419" end="00:08:16.300" style="s2">perception you have intelligence and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.430" end="00:08:18.610" style="s2">have agency and notice the wall the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.300" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">priory flow or the dominant flow is from</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.610" end="00:08:22.360" style="s2">perception through to agency and then of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:23.830" style="s2">course it goes into environment you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.360" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">stuff but it causes the environment to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.830" end="00:08:26.620" style="s2">change in some way and then you can see</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:30.129" style="s2">what happens and your honor</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.620" end="00:08:33.070" style="s2">loop which is now both the Boyd Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.129" end="00:08:35.140" style="s2">loop and the sovereignty loop in the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.070" end="00:08:38.979" style="s2">that I&#39;m describing it now also there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.140" end="00:08:42.010" style="s2">gonna go see another way that we at</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.979" end="00:08:43.899" style="s2">least and I think most sentient</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.010" end="00:08:46.709" style="s2">creatures will have a dispositional</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.899" end="00:08:50.290" style="s2">attitude so for example if you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.709" end="00:08:51.580" style="s2">disposed towards being in a fight let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.290" end="00:08:53.019" style="s2">say for example you&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.580" end="00:08:54.690" style="s2">perceive that you may be in a fight your</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.019" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">body&#39;s not prepared to be in a fight</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.690" end="00:08:59.560" style="s2">you&#39;re actually feeding back from your</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">action potential into your twist making</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:02.940" style="s2">and meaning making all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:05.560" style="s2">perception so you&#39;ll actually be</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.940" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">potentially more likely to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.560" end="00:09:09.910" style="s2">threats and less likely to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:11.950" style="s2">things that are non threats because your</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.910" end="00:09:13.690" style="s2">dispositional attitude that the action</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.950" end="00:09:16.060" style="s2">level is actually feeding back into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.690" end="00:09:20.019" style="s2">circle so there&#39;s there&#39;s forward and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.060" end="00:09:21.310" style="s2">backwards loops in sovereignty okay so</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.019" end="00:09:23.529" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the framework kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.310" end="00:09:25.959" style="s2">theoretical level and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.529" end="00:09:28.510" style="s2">couple of things one is we can speak</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.959" end="00:09:30.250" style="s2">about sovereignty now as almost well not</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.510" end="00:09:32.980" style="s2">as almost as a capacity which means that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.250" end="00:09:35.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuum you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.980" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">certain level of sovereignty it&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.050" end="00:09:38.950" style="s2">certain qualities and this will measure</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:42.490" style="s2">your ability to respond to your</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.950" end="00:09:45.310" style="s2">environment so I may be sovereign now</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.490" end="00:09:47.230" style="s2">under the conditions that I am in under</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.310" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">this roof sets of things to which I must</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.230" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">respond but I might find myself not</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:55.149" style="s2">sovereign something may have come that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:56.860" style="s2">is outside of metrosexual capacity or I</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.149" end="00:09:59.980" style="s2">might have been overwhelmed and overall</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.860" end="00:10:02.500" style="s2">capacity degraded the second thing is</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.980" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">that we can notice how this concept</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.500" end="00:10:07.529" style="s2">relates to some of the other things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:10.300" style="s2">are going on in the broader world so a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.529" end="00:10:14.110" style="s2">hypothesis or heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.300" end="00:10:17.290" style="s2">might be that one should always only act</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.110" end="00:10:23.050" style="s2">in one of two ways either within the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.290" end="00:10:25.720" style="s2">scope of your sovereignty or to upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.050" end="00:10:27.100" style="s2">or improve your sovereignty itself so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.720" end="00:10:29.500" style="s2">you find yourself faced with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.100" end="00:10:33.160" style="s2">potential problem some tasks some</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.500" end="00:10:35.110" style="s2">challenge either you are up to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.160" end="00:10:37.589" style="s2">challenge or your sovereignty is able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.110" end="00:10:40.209" style="s2">respond to what&#39;s happening or you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.589" end="00:10:43.180" style="s2">should actually focus first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.209" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">on getting your sovereignty up to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.180" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2">task which means for example that as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:48.850" style="s2">heuristic if you&#39;re faced with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:51.310" style="s2">challenge that is outside the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.850" end="00:10:54.430" style="s2">your sovereignty venturing into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.310" end="00:10:58.019" style="s2">challenge is only a worst-case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.430" end="00:11:00.550" style="s2">choice what you should instead do is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.019" end="00:11:02.199" style="s2">improve her increase your sovereignty so</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.550" end="00:11:04.100" style="s2">that then you&#39;re able to respond to your</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.199" end="00:11:05.630" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.100" end="00:11:07.670" style="s2">what here might be saying like at a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.630" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">sporting event if you don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.670" end="00:11:11.060" style="s2">shoot an arrow at all you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:13.339" style="s2">to do very well in an archery</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.060" end="00:11:15.500" style="s2">competition and so then rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.339" end="00:11:17.420" style="s2">sort of why are we shooting and missing</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.500" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">the right response is just to upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.420" end="00:11:21.829" style="s2">your capacity become more skillful and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.959" style="s2">that particular endeavor and we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.829" end="00:11:26.750" style="s2">extend this broadly so for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.959" end="00:11:29.329" style="s2">Jordan Peterson I was in ado saying this</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.750" end="00:11:34.100" style="s2">medium pose is in many ways just</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.329" end="00:11:37.790" style="s2">pointing this fact out that sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.100" end="00:11:40.490" style="s2">is the place from which you have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.790" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">ability to be responsible and you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.490" end="00:11:44.690" style="s2">an obligation to be responsible for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:46.220" style="s2">you can be responsible for but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.690" end="00:11:47.750" style="s2">actually in fact foolishness to endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.220" end="00:11:51.410" style="s2">to be responsive outside of your ability</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.750" end="00:11:53.959" style="s2">to respond so first and foremost figure</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.410" end="00:11:55.250" style="s2">out what your sovereignty is so begin in</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.959" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">the middle beginning in the center</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.250" end="00:11:59.690" style="s2">beginning with you you clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:02.180" style="s2">if you can&#39;t take care of something like</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.690" end="00:12:03.380" style="s2">that then what makes you think that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.180" end="00:12:06.319" style="s2">have prepared to take care of something</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.380" end="00:12:08.120" style="s2">even more complex so start with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.319" end="00:12:11.180" style="s2">get yourself sorted out get yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.120" end="00:12:14.600" style="s2">a space of self sovereignty and build</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.180" end="00:12:17.029" style="s2">things like you know awareness of your</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.600" end="00:12:19.189" style="s2">capacities and how your capacities are</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.029" end="00:12:21.199" style="s2">operating now am i overwhelmed am i</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.189" end="00:12:24.290" style="s2">working effectively in my own flow</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.199" end="00:12:27.199" style="s2">around the loop and then build a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.290" end="00:12:31.660" style="s2">learning crawler I build the commitment</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.199" end="00:12:34.850" style="s2">the ability to build capacity then build</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.660" end="00:12:37.160" style="s2">discernment which is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.850" end="00:12:39.500" style="s2">between the capacity components and how</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.160" end="00:12:41.269" style="s2">to actually notice where you are in</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.500" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">relationship to your capacity to learn</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.269" end="00:12:46.100" style="s2">and your capacity then finally to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:48.100" style="s2">respond and as you have gone to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.100" end="00:12:51.610" style="s2">process as you&#39;ve actually mastered</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.100" end="00:12:55.220" style="s2">sovereignty itself then you are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.610" end="00:12:59.000" style="s2">optimally positioned to go out into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.220" end="00:13:02.569" style="s2">world and do begin to address more broad</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.000" end="00:13:06.199" style="s2">and maybe more significant or more in</p>
