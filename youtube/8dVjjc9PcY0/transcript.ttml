<p begin="00:00:04.620" end="00:00:09.480" style="s2">that&#39;s useful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.910" end="00:00:11.790" style="s2">well Sam Austin made it&#39;s been a bloody</p>

<p begin="00:00:11.790" end="00:00:16.440" style="s2">really glad that we&#39;re sitting down and</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.559" end="00:00:19.109" style="s2">doing this so first of all thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.440" end="00:00:22.109" style="s2">stepping into this space with me thank</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:24.830" style="s2">you for really appreciate oh yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.109" end="00:00:28.650" style="s2">it&#39;s a strange thing to try and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.830" end="00:00:31.320" style="s2">recalibrate to building a connection</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.650" end="00:00:34.670" style="s2">with each other and stepping into some</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.320" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">creative space when there is this</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.670" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">impending adult as probably already set</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:40.710" style="s2">in a stage a bit negatively with a word</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">like impending but when there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.710" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">third party an invisible third party in</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">the room because something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">characterized all of our interactions</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">has been it has been almost like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:54.989" style="s2">there has been a safety to step into</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">that space of real collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.989" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">expression so how do you feel first of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">all about like what does it feel like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">now be sitting here doing this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely already a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">tangible presence almost that is frankly</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:17.369" style="s2">mind made but I&#39;m very aware of it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">yeah I agree most of our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.369" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">have been like the framework has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">anything goes essentially and it still</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">is the case but we&#39;re acutely aware that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:31.890" style="s2">you know things can be perceived in ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:35.240" style="s2">that we don&#39;t actually intend so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.890" end="00:01:39.540" style="s2">yeah that is that is precisely it</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.240" end="00:01:42.119" style="s2">there&#39;s something about expression that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.540" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">requires a container that&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.119" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">for it which is which is a thread that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.090" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working with for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">you can think about it in terms of when</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">do you speak truthfully to for example a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:07.590" style="s2">child about a particular experience you</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">know they do you give them the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.590" end="00:02:14.370" style="s2">the hard dose of truth before there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:16.620" style="s2">some somewhere they can be held when</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.370" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2">that truth perhaps overwhelms a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.620" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">particular conception of the world they</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.900" end="00:02:27.150" style="s2">had and so it&#39;s sort of like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:31.739" style="s2">there&#39;s that to take into account too</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.150" end="00:02:35.459" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also what of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.739" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">do you show when you&#39;re not precisely</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.459" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">sure who is going to receive that energy</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:47.130" style="s2">and what will they be doing with it even</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:50.610" style="s2">to use the word energy is something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.130" end="00:02:53.550" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so metaphorical in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.610" end="00:02:55.860" style="s2">some sense that even my using it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.550" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">conscious that you and I can resonate or</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.860" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">begin to resonate with what we might</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:03.140" style="s2">mean by that but some listeners might</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:07.769" style="s2">already be like whoa what energy what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.140" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s going on yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.769" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">thought I find it interesting as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:14.190" style="s2">that the energy tends to for me have</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:19.470" style="s2">more value a lot of the time than the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.190" end="00:03:22.670" style="s2">words do right because the the energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.470" end="00:03:25.410" style="s2">that&#39;s exchanged in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.670" end="00:03:27.030" style="s2">tends to tell me more about what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.410" end="00:03:29.610" style="s2">person&#39;s really trying to say them what</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.030" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">their words are that sounds pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.610" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">absurd I think when I just said it it</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:37.820" style="s2">sounds beautiful to me yeah but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:37.820" style="s2">really is in it really does feel like</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.880" end="00:03:44.579" style="s2">you can pick up on what I suppose it</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.400" end="00:03:47.220" style="s2">comes back to something as abstract as</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.579" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">telepathy in some ways I had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.220" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">conversation recently with friends were</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.730" style="s2">where we were exploring that as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">concept and what we&#39;ve come to realize</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.730" end="00:04:01.250" style="s2">is even in the word itself telepathy as</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">you break it up telly and pathy seems to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.250" end="00:04:08.489" style="s2">have its origins in like telly empathy</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:11.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s more about your feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.489" end="00:04:14.459" style="s2">exchange of the other person&#39;s energy</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.090" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">more than your feeling more than your</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.459" end="00:04:20.260" style="s2">seeing the words that are inside their</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:27.010" style="s2">mind you&#39;re feeling what they</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.260" end="00:04:28.840" style="s2">intend to say mm-hmm and that itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.010" end="00:04:31.030" style="s2">seems to be a good natural container for</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.840" end="00:04:34.540" style="s2">conversations too just to have pure</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.030" end="00:04:36.700" style="s2">intentions a lot the time when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.540" end="00:04:38.620" style="s2">exploring these more controversial ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.700" end="00:04:42.490" style="s2">part of what I really appreciate about</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.620" end="00:04:45.820" style="s2">our exchange is that we can entertain</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.490" end="00:04:49.420" style="s2">ideas without necessarily being</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.820" end="00:04:51.580" style="s2">identified with them and with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.420" end="00:04:55.090" style="s2">boundary set we can then really dive</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.580" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">into it to explore deeper than where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.090" end="00:05:04.360" style="s2">let&#39;s say authentically app or embodying</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:08.410" style="s2">at this moment and that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.360" end="00:05:12.760" style="s2">really useful framework itself perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.410" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">yeah to set it in the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.760" end="00:05:18.550" style="s2">podcast like this yeah for the ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:22.060" style="s2">progress of voice one right I know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.550" end="00:05:26.590" style="s2">agree with you the idea being that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:29.620" style="s2">ideas we explore here or not be taken to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.590" end="00:05:34.930" style="s2">be the sort of fixed representations of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.620" end="00:05:37.930" style="s2">yeah yes right however we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.930" end="00:05:40.780" style="s2">cede the expression of those ideas with</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.930" end="00:05:45.310" style="s2">a certain sort of intention that has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.780" end="00:05:49.350" style="s2">purity that can only come from some sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.310" end="00:05:52.300" style="s2">of authentic manifestation of who we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.350" end="00:05:56.890" style="s2">which is a strange oppositional thing to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.300" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">hold as well but before we go too much</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.890" end="00:06:02.890" style="s2">deeper this is in some sense we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:05.350" style="s2">even entirely sure what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.890" end="00:06:08.770" style="s2">but for whatever we&#39;re doing here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.350" end="00:06:13.620" style="s2">important I think that you express to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.770" end="00:06:16.330" style="s2">but also our audience who you are and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.620" end="00:06:20.740" style="s2">perhaps a little bit about how we came</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.330" end="00:06:24.340" style="s2">to know each other and I&#39;d also like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.740" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">hear about live learn evolve lle mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.340" end="00:06:30.260" style="s2">and what that project has what that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.430" end="00:06:32.600" style="s2">project is and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.260" end="00:06:37.700" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll begin there I don&#39;t know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.600" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">no worries well yeah my name is Sammy</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.700" end="00:06:46.790" style="s2">Austin I&#39;m playing the role as live</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.790" end="00:06:53.270" style="s2">websites live learn evolve calm and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:56.870" style="s2">essentially a it&#39;s a kind of digital</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.270" end="00:07:00.740" style="s2">rabbit hole essentially it&#39;s a blog but</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.870" end="00:07:04.700" style="s2">over the years it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s evolved</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.740" end="00:07:07.480" style="s2">from being like a a site that&#39;s focused</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.700" end="00:07:09.710" style="s2">on self-improvement from the get-go and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.480" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">slowly over time has explored various</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.710" end="00:07:15.640" style="s2">western philosophies then gone into more</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:18.320" style="s2">kind of Eastern and esoteric subjects</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.640" end="00:07:21.530" style="s2">meditation yoga Buddhism these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.320" end="00:07:24.140" style="s2">psychedelics and kind of culminated now</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.530" end="00:07:28.490" style="s2">as an overall digit digital rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.140" end="00:07:31.640" style="s2">of content where yeah any of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.490" end="00:07:34.430" style="s2">topics users can go and dive into mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.640" end="00:07:41.030" style="s2">the platform itself and explore it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.430" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">find a hole yeah hole yeah hole of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.030" end="00:07:48.230" style="s2">content yeah yeah and it&#39;s been a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:53.450" style="s2">been a natural reflection of my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.230" end="00:07:54.830" style="s2">journey actually the content itself if</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.450" end="00:07:57.890" style="s2">you were to go through the pages of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.830" end="00:08:01.210" style="s2">site it&#39;s very much reflecting exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.890" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">where I am and the other writers and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.210" end="00:08:06.200" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been resonating with at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:08.780" style="s2">time has been the inspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.200" end="00:08:10.430" style="s2">actually share that on right age right</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.780" end="00:08:12.380" style="s2">and so it&#39;s been very natural in its</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.430" end="00:08:15.860" style="s2">evolution that comes through quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.380" end="00:08:18.680" style="s2">uh-huh in that from the sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.860" end="00:08:20.330" style="s2">have a certain conversation and I&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.680" end="00:08:22.790" style="s2">something appear on the site you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.330" end="00:08:25.790" style="s2">share something huh and it feels as</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.790" end="00:08:27.650" style="s2">though yeah that is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.790" end="00:08:29.750" style="s2">something you&#39;re grappling with or</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.650" end="00:08:31.610" style="s2">battling with that&#39;s putting my language</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.750" end="00:08:34.340" style="s2">I usually battle with I did maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.610" end="00:08:38.050" style="s2">a slightly smoother than me but it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.340" end="00:08:41.960" style="s2">I could if I could sum up much of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.050" end="00:08:44.089" style="s2">focus that seems to be put forward its</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.960" end="00:08:45.740" style="s2">various pieces of insight</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.089" end="00:08:48.459" style="s2">into the process of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.740" end="00:08:54.920" style="s2">mm-hmm that seemed to me to be that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.459" end="00:08:57.649" style="s2">and I would say it&#39;s it&#39;s the dance of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.920" end="00:09:00.709" style="s2">transformation that might be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.649" end="00:09:03.379" style="s2">core things that characterizes our</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.709" end="00:09:05.029" style="s2">shared interest mm-hmm and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.379" end="00:09:07.939" style="s2">interesting thing about that is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.029" end="00:09:09.769" style="s2">that is perhaps the least unique</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.939" end="00:09:12.110" style="s2">interest you could actually have and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.769" end="00:09:14.089" style="s2">although expressing it at a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.110" end="00:09:17.449" style="s2">at a certain point of resonance with</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.089" end="00:09:19.009" style="s2">someone is necessarily unique as another</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.449" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">one of those oppositional kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.009" end="00:09:24.740" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that&#39;s another strange</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:27.949" style="s2">strange tension that has has just come</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.740" end="00:09:30.769" style="s2">to be ever more apparent in in my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.949" end="00:09:35.499" style="s2">experience which is that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.769" end="00:09:39.559" style="s2">most fundamental aspects of life of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.499" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">experience things you might be tempted</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.559" end="00:09:46.009" style="s2">to identify with as special and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:51.350" style="s2">meaningful about your life are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.009" end="00:09:56.089" style="s2">over of a source of a shared possibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.350" end="00:09:59.300" style="s2">that everyone can experience so some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.089" end="00:10:02.300" style="s2">the most meaningful things in life are</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.300" end="00:10:03.649" style="s2">in fact the most fundamental things</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.300" end="00:10:05.569" style="s2">there are to do and that can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.649" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">expressed in so many ways I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.569" end="00:10:10.610" style="s2">might think about it in terms of shared</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:11.779" style="s2">stories we all participate in mm-hmm you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.610" end="00:10:14.300" style="s2">might think about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.779" end="00:10:17.540" style="s2">archetypes mm-hmm I know we often talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.300" end="00:10:24.499" style="s2">about have that sort of dance between</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.540" end="00:10:29.139" style="s2">the relevance for expression between</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.499" end="00:10:32.860" style="s2">sort of form and void or or what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.139" end="00:10:36.769" style="s2">primary in some sense in how we ought</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.860" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">characterize the state of experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.769" end="00:10:42.559" style="s2">that might be associated with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:45.980" style="s2">like an emptiness or a no thingness and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.559" end="00:10:47.720" style="s2">then the other side of the coin so to</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.980" end="00:10:50.029" style="s2">speak that the grasping of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.720" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">again they&#39;re identifying with it again</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.029" end="00:10:56.590" style="s2">the contemplating at the fixing it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:11:00.490" style="s2">there seems to be you know that process</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.590" end="00:11:02.110" style="s2">itself of releasing from identity and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.490" end="00:11:06.160" style="s2">then grasping it again</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.110" end="00:11:09.250" style="s2">is is in some sense an engine of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.160" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">most profound nature it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.250" end="00:11:13.570" style="s2">profound thing we do mankind</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">characterizes us as well as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.570" end="00:11:19.870" style="s2">like um niche constructors you know as</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:21.580" style="s2">human beings we&#39;re so weakened and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.870" end="00:11:24.070" style="s2">know everything is a futile when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.580" end="00:11:25.960" style="s2">born and it takes us so long to develop</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.070" end="00:11:27.910" style="s2">and we have this machinery that enables</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.960" end="00:11:30.430" style="s2">us to adapt and so one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.910" end="00:11:33.300" style="s2">fundamental things we are from all these</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.430" end="00:11:37.660" style="s2">perspectives is that which transforms</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.300" end="00:11:40.570" style="s2">and I we resonate strongly about that so</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.660" end="00:11:44.200" style="s2">it is it&#39;s bit so it&#39;s this like is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.570" end="00:11:46.420" style="s2">we resonate I resonate but but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.200" end="00:11:49.530" style="s2">but but to resonate involves</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.420" end="00:11:54.780" style="s2">relinquishing the I that that resonates</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.530" end="00:11:54.780" style="s2">mm-hmm and here we are filming ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.860" end="00:12:02.530" style="s2">it&#39;s so strange like it&#39;s like always</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.660" end="00:12:06.820" style="s2">the coin-flipping ever more ever more</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.530" end="00:12:09.610" style="s2">meta and in some sense the absurd point</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.820" end="00:12:12.280" style="s2">of view is always there as well you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.610" end="00:12:14.680" style="s2">you can it&#39;s important it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.280" end="00:12:16.360" style="s2">laugh at it mm-hmm so I guess that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.680" end="00:12:18.460" style="s2">bit of a riff on transformation but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.360" end="00:12:22.050" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fair characteristic a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.460" end="00:12:24.300" style="s2">fair characterization of of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.050" end="00:12:26.620" style="s2">transformation and lle and the resonance</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.300" end="00:12:28.330" style="s2">that you look to promote yeah for sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.620" end="00:12:32.320" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely been a natural outcome</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.330" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2">of that dance of transformation of of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.320" end="00:12:41.350" style="s2">seeking actually myself actually right</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.950" end="00:12:45.250" style="s2">and then and then yeah out of that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.350" end="00:12:48.330" style="s2">which manifests as being as resonating</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.250" end="00:12:52.690" style="s2">with me has has then supplied the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.330" end="00:12:55.660" style="s2">inspiration to go and shared up mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.690" end="00:12:59.970" style="s2">with an article or a video mhm</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.660" end="00:12:59.970" style="s2">or even just on the Facebook page</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.070" end="00:13:07.540" style="s2">how do you see your world developing now</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.770" end="00:13:09.700" style="s2">like how do you see yourself like wow</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.540" end="00:13:13.590" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s because it&#39;s a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.700" end="00:13:18.130" style="s2">right we we participate in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.590" end="00:13:20.770" style="s2">interweaving web of society and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.130" end="00:13:24.100" style="s2">cosmos that is so much larger than us</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.770" end="00:13:26.170" style="s2">but is I don&#39;t think and I believe you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.100" end="00:13:28.030" style="s2">hold the same view that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.170" end="00:13:33.210" style="s2">consider it separate from us in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.030" end="00:13:37.960" style="s2">fundamental sense and so we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.210" end="00:13:40.450" style="s2">we are non-dual with it yet we also have</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.960" end="00:13:41.860" style="s2">to take on roles at times many roles</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.450" end="00:13:44.650" style="s2">throughout our lives perhaps many roles</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.860" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">in the same period of your life with</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.650" end="00:13:51.010" style="s2">with different people where we perform</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:55.180" style="s2">different functions oriented still by</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.010" end="00:13:57.010" style="s2">that shared resonance hopefully but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.180" end="00:13:58.770" style="s2">point is nevertheless we do fix</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.010" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">ourselves in the world for certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.770" end="00:14:05.050" style="s2">certain purposes and I&#39;m and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:07.540" style="s2">genuinely I&#39;m genuinely interested in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.050" end="00:14:11.650" style="s2">you and I&#39;m genuinely interested in how</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.540" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">you see yourself fitting the world what</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.650" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">role like what feels what feels resonant</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:21.510" style="s2">to you in terms of concretizing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:21.510" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:39.899" style="s2">I don&#39;t have I don&#39;t put much energy</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.660" end="00:14:43.259" style="s2">into the future actually it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.899" end="00:14:46.550" style="s2">dropped off a lot in terms of if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.259" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">saying about like yet where might I see</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.550" end="00:14:54.839" style="s2">this path that you&#39;ve seen formulating</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:56.759" style="s2">where it might go I have no idea then</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.839" end="00:15:00.449" style="s2">it&#39;s actually and I actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.759" end="00:15:04.980" style="s2">preference for that because when I kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.449" end="00:15:11.610" style="s2">of give up any fixed goal of where it</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.980" end="00:15:14.449" style="s2">might go I find that there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.610" end="00:15:17.550" style="s2">freedom and whilst it&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.449" end="00:15:20.839" style="s2">that I do set goals because I am someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.550" end="00:15:25.230" style="s2">that&#39;s very long conscientiousness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.839" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">and by actually aiming for them and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.230" end="00:15:30.149" style="s2">being aware that the goals can</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:35.699" style="s2">dynamically move and adjust as you move</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.149" end="00:15:39.660" style="s2">forward a lot of this path has just</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.699" end="00:15:44.069" style="s2">being one of surrender it&#39;s been a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.660" end="00:15:47.300" style="s2">of giving up what I think about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.069" end="00:15:51.029" style="s2">world mm-hmm and allowing reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.300" end="00:15:52.620" style="s2">to present its symbols and its signpost</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.029" end="00:15:56.579" style="s2">for me and then me following that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.620" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">intuitively in the moment that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.579" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">where there&#39;s a lot of freedom so yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.879" end="00:16:09.289" style="s2">there are a few things on the radar at</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.459" end="00:16:13.189" style="s2">the moment for the future where I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.289" end="00:16:17.119" style="s2">I may focus my attention yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.189" end="00:16:19.789" style="s2">whether that&#39;s like recently becoming</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.119" end="00:16:22.069" style="s2">yoga teacher for example which I never</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.789" end="00:16:26.029" style="s2">thought I would have done at all right</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.069" end="00:16:28.129" style="s2">it was fall off the spectrum but just</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.029" end="00:16:30.259" style="s2">using that as an example there were many</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.129" end="00:16:34.839" style="s2">many synchronicity synchronicities and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.259" end="00:16:39.709" style="s2">instances whereby the people around me</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.839" end="00:16:41.649" style="s2">were out of nowhere suggesting that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.709" end="00:16:46.459" style="s2">is something that I should pursue</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.649" end="00:16:52.220" style="s2">without me even saying anything right</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.459" end="00:16:56.509" style="s2">however you do you do have a nature that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.220" end="00:17:00.769" style="s2">I mean they say the feeling I get from</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.509" end="00:17:02.269" style="s2">you is authenticity you know and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.769" end="00:17:04.490" style="s2">want to put that too high on it on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.269" end="00:17:08.860" style="s2">pedestal right like so don&#39;t worry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.490" end="00:17:13.549" style="s2">not occasionally you up here or thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.860" end="00:17:17.779" style="s2">you do and and what that suggests is</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.549" end="00:17:20.779" style="s2">that in fact what is reflected back to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.779" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">you should those relationships have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.779" end="00:17:27.759" style="s2">certain degree of honesty towards the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:30.409" style="s2">direction of some real reflection</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.759" end="00:17:34.090" style="s2">well you&#39;ll receive information there</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.409" end="00:17:38.149" style="s2">that might help shine the light on</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.090" end="00:17:41.059" style="s2">something real for you to realize about</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.149" end="00:17:45.620" style="s2">your nature mm-hmm so so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.059" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">interesting because you know and I find</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.620" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">that very resonant attractive necessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:59.299" style="s2">this attitude towards no fixed outcome</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.139" style="s2">however we also have to have goals and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.299" end="00:18:01.879" style="s2">so there&#39;s a combat there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.139" end="00:18:03.769" style="s2">conversation to be had about just what</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.879" end="00:18:09.070" style="s2">the process of reimagining those goals</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.769" end="00:18:11.210" style="s2">are and how all that works but the and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.070" end="00:18:13.789" style="s2">it perhaps would not be right to</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.210" end="00:18:16.809" style="s2">formulate showing up in the world as</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.789" end="00:18:18.500" style="s2">authentic as itself being an outcome</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.809" end="00:18:21.049" style="s2">it&#39;s perhaps much</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.500" end="00:18:22.940" style="s2">I might say some sort of aligning</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.049" end="00:18:27.889" style="s2">yourself with an appropriate expression</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.940" end="00:18:32.419" style="s2">or way to be but it but that mode itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.889" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">is presenting ice it&#39;s like it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.419" end="00:18:44.120" style="s2">suppose it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">allowing it&#39;s allowing yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.120" end="00:18:50.750" style="s2">realized in a way that it&#39;s not solely</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.799" end="00:18:53.480" style="s2">relying on its own like it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.750" end="00:18:55.309" style="s2">perverted incestual way of realizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.480" end="00:18:57.590" style="s2">self mean Jung speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.309" end="00:18:59.450" style="s2">individuation as something that also has</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.590" end="00:19:02.450" style="s2">to be carried out in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.450" end="00:19:04.549" style="s2">others and that idea is resonant with</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.450" end="00:19:06.769" style="s2">what we&#39;ve already begun to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.549" end="00:19:08.980" style="s2">here is a sort of deeper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.769" end="00:19:14.450" style="s2">interconnectedness mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.980" end="00:19:17.090" style="s2">so so yeah I don&#39;t have a fixed place</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.450" end="00:19:19.669" style="s2">I&#39;m really heading with this expression</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.090" end="00:19:22.129" style="s2">but that does seem to be a commitment</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.669" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">that the point is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.129" end="00:19:26.840" style="s2">commitment here to a certain way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">being even if it&#39;s not a commitment to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.840" end="00:19:31.879" style="s2">fixed outcome which I think perhaps yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:34.820" style="s2">important to make conceptually clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.879" end="00:19:40.399" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re definitely um I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.820" end="00:19:45.110" style="s2">say there&#39;s been a noticeable shift in</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.399" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">the way I ontologically orient myself in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.110" end="00:19:51.889" style="s2">the world there has been quite profound</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:58.929" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s nothing new at all or</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.889" end="00:20:03.529" style="s2">unique to me but it&#39;s it&#39;s a shift from</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.929" end="00:20:10.759" style="s2">attention being focused on the inner</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.529" end="00:20:16.870" style="s2">narrative to attention focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.759" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">space between the thoughts mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.870" end="00:20:27.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like a um just a residing in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:30.410" style="s2">space of being through many years of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.410" end="00:20:32.210" style="s2">just surrendering and listening in to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.410" end="00:20:34.040" style="s2">the heart space to the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.210" end="00:20:38.150" style="s2">whatever you want to call it mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.040" end="00:20:40.340" style="s2">then acting from there yes yes I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.150" end="00:20:42.820" style="s2">to the other way around which caused me</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.340" end="00:20:45.590" style="s2">a lot of suffering I think it causes a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.820" end="00:20:47.540" style="s2">lot of people suffering yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.590" end="00:20:50.750" style="s2">the attachment to that in a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.540" end="00:20:53.060" style="s2">yes a lot the time because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.750" end="00:20:57.590" style="s2">conditioned narrative or yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.060" end="00:21:01.100" style="s2">influenced by external things we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.590" end="00:21:03.710" style="s2">have control over and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.100" end="00:21:07.730" style="s2">brought about a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.710" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">inspiration anyway in spirit mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.730" end="00:21:16.840" style="s2">it&#39;s very mm-hmm I understand I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:16.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.360" end="00:21:28.690" style="s2">the articulation of acting from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.940" end="00:21:28.690" style="s2">place between stimulus and response is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.930" end="00:21:45.130" style="s2">critical articulation and and learning</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.140" end="00:21:52.100" style="s2">in the process practicing the process of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.130" end="00:21:59.510" style="s2">embodying that disposition in your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.100" end="00:22:04.250" style="s2">is seems to me a necessary a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.510" end="00:22:11.800" style="s2">part of growth and transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.250" end="00:22:16.970" style="s2">ultimately self transcendence it enables</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.800" end="00:22:25.540" style="s2">it enables you to actually take the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.970" end="00:22:29.570" style="s2">world in which is which is fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.540" end="00:22:32.360" style="s2">yeah you drop out of being confined to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.570" end="00:22:35.380" style="s2">any particular lens as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.360" end="00:22:38.000" style="s2">any somewhat towards that way and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.380" end="00:22:41.290" style="s2">perhaps it perhaps its entire taking it</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:45.740" style="s2">can go as far as entirely being that way</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.290" end="00:22:50.750" style="s2">although it&#39;s it&#39;s had to describe the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.740" end="00:22:52.970" style="s2">place from which there is no lens is in</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.750" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">some respects I mean it that really is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.970" end="00:22:58.370" style="s2">undescribable that is it&#39;s a pure it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:22:59.630" style="s2">I would say that&#39;s a pure well like you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.370" end="00:23:01.160" style="s2">might push back on this and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.630" end="00:23:03.890" style="s2">good and put good to push back because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.160" end="00:23:06.380" style="s2">said it&#39;s a what came to mind would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.890" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">to say that&#39;s a it&#39;s a pure chaos of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.380" end="00:23:14.530" style="s2">experience however it does seem like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:17.570" style="s2">accepting of a place of no lens</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.530" end="00:23:22.869" style="s2">transcending that experience therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.570" end="00:23:27.109" style="s2">of chaos is something that is attainable</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.869" end="00:23:31.489" style="s2">well I tend to see I tend to see the if</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.109" end="00:23:36.679" style="s2">your orientation is is primarily focused</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.489" end="00:23:45.739" style="s2">on the inner narrative to me that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.679" end="00:23:50.779" style="s2">chaos and but and the light of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.739" end="00:23:53.239" style="s2">by actually by a perceiving reality by</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.779" end="00:23:55.429" style="s2">dropping back into being here in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.239" end="00:24:00.499" style="s2">ways you&#39;ll that is bringing order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.429" end="00:24:02.569" style="s2">the chaos mm-hmm however however that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.499" end="00:24:05.239" style="s2">does put you in a in a strange position</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.569" end="00:24:06.709" style="s2">and I suppose it&#39;s always gonna sound</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.239" end="00:24:10.279" style="s2">paradoxical when we talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.709" end="00:24:12.889" style="s2">things but it puts you in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.279" end="00:24:17.269" style="s2">where you&#39;re standing right now is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.889" end="00:24:21.699" style="s2">facing the unknown mm-hmm because you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.269" end="00:24:24.079" style="s2">you&#39;re giving up any ideological lens or</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.699" end="00:24:27.529" style="s2">preconceived assumptions or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.079" end="00:24:34.039" style="s2">mm-hmm and you&#39;re just facing reality as</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.529" end="00:24:40.609" style="s2">it is now and that to some extent could</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.039" end="00:24:44.959" style="s2">be can be akin to facing chaos yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.609" end="00:24:54.259" style="s2">now I I understand I would say the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.959" end="00:24:58.509" style="s2">of associating chaos with too much</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.259" end="00:24:58.509" style="s2">attention paid to the inner narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.779" end="00:25:06.079" style="s2">right but it would seem to me that a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.499" end="00:25:10.359" style="s2">more accurate way of stating it would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.079" end="00:25:12.099" style="s2">to say well precisely too much</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.359" end="00:25:16.669" style="s2">identification with the inner narrative</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.099" end="00:25:19.519" style="s2">leads to chaos we it is also helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.669" end="00:25:22.399" style="s2">attend to the inner narrative attending</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.519" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">I think the right word you used there</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.399" end="00:25:26.860" style="s2">was identification as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:28.180" style="s2">nice one that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.860" end="00:25:30.940" style="s2">this part is more of an issue than</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.180" end="00:25:36.370" style="s2">attending to it yeah right right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.940" end="00:25:42.210" style="s2">buddy but even then we we take on roles</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.370" end="00:25:49.330" style="s2">for certain times mm-hmm so it&#39;s so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.210" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">so so perhaps a more mature way yet to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.330" end="00:25:57.280" style="s2">refer to what it is to take on an</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:26:00.670" style="s2">identity or to attend to it as you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.280" end="00:26:02.800" style="s2">perform it or to perform an identity in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.670" end="00:26:05.890" style="s2">relation with other people in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.800" end="00:26:09.580" style="s2">situation in the world that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.890" end="00:26:16.780" style="s2">something that all be done lightly to</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.580" end="00:26:18.850" style="s2">some degree right so so it but but then</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.780" end="00:26:20.620" style="s2">I but then I also feel what what comes</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.850" end="00:26:38.410" style="s2">to me here is that it&#39;s it&#39;s worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.620" end="00:26:42.070" style="s2">to express the importance of well we do</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.410" end="00:26:44.350" style="s2">release and while we well it is in an</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.070" end="00:26:51.030" style="s2">important sense important to face the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.350" end="00:26:58.260" style="s2">unknown we we&#39;re not relinquishing</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.030" end="00:27:01.060" style="s2">absolutely everything about what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.260" end="00:27:07.110" style="s2">helpful to bring with you to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.060" end="00:27:07.110" style="s2">that space it&#39;s not I would say about</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:14.290" style="s2">for example completely abandoning all</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.419" end="00:28:17.649" style="s2">cultivating presence mm-hmm awareness</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.659" end="00:28:20.639" style="s2">mm-hmm you know whether that&#39;s through a</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.639" end="00:28:28.450" style="s2">where you&#39;re dipping into that space</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.049" end="00:28:34.210" style="s2">more frequently mm-hmm so that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.450" end="00:28:37.950" style="s2">familiarize yourself with being lensless</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.210" end="00:28:39.820" style="s2">if you want to call it that or just</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.950" end="00:28:43.200" style="s2">because in the beginning it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.820" end="00:28:45.429" style="s2">difficult there&#39;s this there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.200" end="00:28:48.639" style="s2">this whole sections in bookstores</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.429" end="00:28:51.639" style="s2">dedicated to mindfulness these days you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.639" end="00:28:54.850" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s recognized now as</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.639" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">something that&#39;s important although I</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.850" end="00:29:00.100" style="s2">find the mindfulness word quite funny is</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.860" end="00:29:04.570" style="s2">in be mindful of mm-hmm how fool your</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.100" end="00:29:06.639" style="s2">mind is but essentially that&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.570" end="00:29:11.399" style="s2">like a westernized version a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.639" end="00:29:13.990" style="s2">time of what has been primarily</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.399" end="00:29:16.779" style="s2">something that the Eastern philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.990" end="00:29:20.440" style="s2">has been so focused on and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.779" end="00:29:22.450" style="s2">so much interested in in being aware of</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">how before your mind is they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.450" end="00:29:28.809" style="s2">interested in clearing the mind right</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:31.000" style="s2">and that is something that doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.809" end="00:29:34.419" style="s2">happen instantly for sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.000" end="00:29:37.320" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly a practice if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.419" end="00:29:39.879" style="s2">talking about our toolkit mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.320" end="00:29:41.139" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing those toolkits emerge right</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.879" end="00:29:45.249" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.139" end="00:29:49.639" style="s2">yoga studios and breath work and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.249" end="00:29:53.559" style="s2">psychedelics these are all ways to help</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.639" end="00:29:53.559" style="s2">clear the mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:30:03.420" style="s2">and yeah it&#39;s very it&#39;s useful to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.620" end="00:30:07.650" style="s2">mention that because even in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.420" end="00:30:09.930" style="s2">spiritual sphere is there a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.650" end="00:30:13.320" style="s2">people tend to jump on the non-dual</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.930" end="00:30:15.300" style="s2">approach of saying well we&#39;ll just wake</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.320" end="00:30:18.780" style="s2">up now and realize that you&#39;re not your</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.300" end="00:30:21.870" style="s2">thoughts and be done with it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.780" end="00:30:26.700" style="s2">just a spontaneous thing which can end</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.870" end="00:30:29.550" style="s2">now but there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.700" end="00:30:32.400" style="s2">it seems and that that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.550" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">normally associated with some spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.400" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">gurus or spiritual people that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">giving talks or their their running</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:45.810" style="s2">certain online education programs and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:49.080" style="s2">this is all way etcetera and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.810" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">perhaps little set of the relative</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.080" end="00:30:55.380" style="s2">aspect of Awakening which is very much</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:57.510" style="s2">the dance mm between surrendering back</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.380" end="00:31:00.540" style="s2">to being and then going back into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.510" end="00:31:03.810" style="s2">world as the actor and and through that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.540" end="00:31:05.850" style="s2">process cultivating the space of being</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.810" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">so that what you&#39;re actually doing is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.850" end="00:31:12.480" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re informing the mind body</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:18.420" style="s2">with presence and over time that seems</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:25.550" style="s2">that allow you to I perceive more</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.420" end="00:31:25.550" style="s2">reality as it is mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.980" end="00:31:38.670" style="s2">something that came up for me when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.850" end="00:31:43.910" style="s2">were speaking was that a characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.670" end="00:31:49.860" style="s2">of this cultivation this development of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.910" end="00:31:53.600" style="s2">the experience that persists through</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.860" end="00:31:57.690" style="s2">transformation might be something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.600" end="00:32:01.170" style="s2">the development of the belief in</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.690" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">yourself itself with a big s development</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.170" end="00:32:09.060" style="s2">of the belief in your soul an</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:12.410" style="s2">identification with the very possibility</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.060" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like the transcendent spring of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.410" end="00:32:21.810" style="s2">possibility that enables and is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:25.430" style="s2">precondition for experience at all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.810" end="00:32:27.930" style="s2">precondition for for joy for force</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.430" end="00:32:29.370" style="s2">suffering importantly the precondition</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.930" end="00:32:34.790" style="s2">for as well for the transcendence of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.370" end="00:32:38.430" style="s2">suffering and that there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.790" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">it&#39;s this God something that typifies</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.430" end="00:32:45.020" style="s2">typifies my experience and I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:50.900" style="s2">suggest typifies the experience of of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.020" end="00:32:54.270" style="s2">all of us really is this unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.900" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">aspect of the dance between connection</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.270" end="00:32:59.040" style="s2">and disconnection which is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:08.870" style="s2">sometimes feel more disconnected than</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.040" end="00:33:08.870" style="s2">you know connected and you know I it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.250" end="00:33:21.030" style="s2">the word faith comes to mind here and to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:30.060" style="s2">be used like it&#39;s it&#39;s almost as though</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.030" end="00:33:35.100" style="s2">you you you you you cultivate a faith in</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.060" end="00:33:37.260" style="s2">your capacity to to remember and come</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.100" end="00:33:39.090" style="s2">home again to find connection again</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.260" end="00:33:41.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s this at one at one thing of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.090" end="00:33:43.920" style="s2">coming of remembering the embo within</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.400" end="00:33:47.460" style="s2">the home within even as you face out</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.920" end="00:33:51.660" style="s2">into that they&#39;ll know yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.460" end="00:33:56.370" style="s2">faith is the the non-rational isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.660" end="00:34:01.650" style="s2">this is the trans rational even yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.370" end="00:34:06.090" style="s2">yeah and a lot of the time the reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.650" end="00:34:09.540" style="s2">that&#39;s pointed back as as a surrender</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.090" end="00:34:13.830" style="s2">and I often say I&#39;m surrendering</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.540" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">meditation is purely because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.830" end="00:34:19.320" style="s2">the time the individual is so caught up</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:23.850" style="s2">and identified with their thoughts the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.320" end="00:34:26.100" style="s2">toolkit they need is to be shown that by</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.850" end="00:34:28.320" style="s2">giving up meditation or just</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.100" end="00:34:31.620" style="s2">surrendering meditation for a moment is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.320" end="00:34:33.480" style="s2">the way for them to bring more balance</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.620" end="00:34:36.020" style="s2">back mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.480" end="00:34:38.820" style="s2">because when you do bring balance back</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.020" end="00:34:42.530" style="s2">mentation isn&#39;t an issue overthinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.820" end="00:34:45.020" style="s2">necessary because you&#39;ll primarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.530" end="00:34:47.179" style="s2">sitting in the space between you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.020" end="00:34:51.260" style="s2">already kind of balanced out mm-hmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.179" end="00:34:54.050" style="s2">like we talked earlier about yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.260" end="00:34:55.850" style="s2">it&#39;s not the best topic to bring up I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.050" end="00:35:01.010" style="s2">gonna free will in determinate like</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.850" end="00:35:02.780" style="s2">every denomination not the best but no</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.010" end="00:35:05.660" style="s2">just the idea that I would see even in</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.780" end="00:35:09.950" style="s2">myself before I went down the the path</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.660" end="00:35:14.210" style="s2">of of exploring anything spiritual I</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.950" end="00:35:18.170" style="s2">would look back on that as being a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.210" end="00:35:21.020" style="s2">automated way of living hmm it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.170" end="00:35:24.410" style="s2">pretty much devoid of freewill in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.020" end="00:35:28.580" style="s2">way that I look at it now mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.410" end="00:35:35.810" style="s2">and that freedom seems to have been</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.580" end="00:35:38.300" style="s2">regained by using these tools to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.810" end="00:35:41.390" style="s2">cultivate the space between stimulus and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.300" end="00:35:48.760" style="s2">response right so that now I can clearly</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.390" end="00:35:53.740" style="s2">discern what is a habituated action or</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.760" end="00:35:57.670" style="s2">patterned thought process mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.740" end="00:36:02.780" style="s2">conditioned and what is just pure and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.670" end="00:36:11.990" style="s2">arising as inspiration and intuition and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.780" end="00:36:18.290" style="s2">authenticity as it is mm hmm hmm two</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.990" end="00:36:23.450" style="s2">things come to mind one is that due to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.290" end="00:36:25.850" style="s2">the the the grand complexity of life</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.450" end="00:36:31.700" style="s2">mm-hmm the complexity that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.850" end="00:36:35.530" style="s2">involved in the immense age of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.700" end="00:36:40.300" style="s2">universe and our biological lineage and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.530" end="00:36:40.300" style="s2">perhaps our metaphysical lineage</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.520" end="00:37:00.150" style="s2">the the number of ways to express just</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.490" end="00:37:00.810" style="s2">how patterned our existence is is in</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.150" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">surmount it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.810" end="00:37:09.420" style="s2">I wonder if it&#39;s truly insurmountable</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:12.380" style="s2">right like so so the this place of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.420" end="00:37:20.070" style="s2">not clear to me that authenticity as</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.380" end="00:37:24.990" style="s2">such as means to act from a place where</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.070" end="00:37:27.090" style="s2">you are totally attendant to a pure</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.990" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">arising where that&#39;s understood as not</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.090" end="00:37:31.740" style="s2">being itself just an expression of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:35.640" style="s2">another pattern it seems to me more like</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.740" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">the identification with the realization</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.640" end="00:37:42.330" style="s2">or the the transcendence of previous</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:46.860" style="s2">patterns and and sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.330" end="00:37:50.510" style="s2">voluntary realization of a what more</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.860" end="00:37:54.230" style="s2">metaphors kind of a higher frequency and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.510" end="00:37:56.850" style="s2">more maturity mm-hmm deeper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.230" end="00:38:00.890" style="s2">awareness and fitted nurses it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.850" end="00:38:05.850" style="s2">appropriate for you to walk within a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.890" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">wider net of of conception of the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.850" end="00:38:16.500" style="s2">there&#39;s more you can appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">identify right action in greater domains</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.500" end="00:38:22.230" style="s2">larger domains but that the process</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:24.810" style="s2">itself so I and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.230" end="00:38:28.230" style="s2">somewhere where we would again resonate</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.810" end="00:38:29.780" style="s2">that the process itself of that meets</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.230" end="00:38:33.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not it it&#39;s never-ending</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.780" end="00:38:38.520" style="s2">that unlike is it would you say this the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.090" end="00:38:42.060" style="s2">unpacking the the detangling of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.520" end="00:38:44.420" style="s2">who you are would yeah it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.060" end="00:38:47.400" style="s2">to end it would seem that we moved to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.420" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">higher process mmm-hmm I say instead</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.400" end="00:38:53.000" style="s2">mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:56.420" style="s2">but one that is I suppose almost like</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.000" end="00:38:58.520" style="s2">biomimicry for some reason that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.420" end="00:39:06.430" style="s2">mind because then the the process of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.520" end="00:39:06.430" style="s2">your action is Springs from nature so</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.260" end="00:39:17.450" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s not a mimicry but it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.780" end="00:39:20.150" style="s2">by by process by being pure what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.450" end="00:39:27.040" style="s2">is it&#39;s it&#39;s not conditioned by anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.150" end="00:39:29.960" style="s2">previous perhaps previously from a minds</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.040" end="00:39:34.070" style="s2">conception of what the world ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.960" end="00:39:36.170" style="s2">mm-hmm we would say because it was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.070" end="00:39:38.090" style="s2">funny like depends almost what what</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.170" end="00:39:44.690" style="s2">perspective you want to take on it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.090" end="00:39:47.120" style="s2">like I have no children one day if I am</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.690" end="00:39:50.360" style="s2">so fortunate although I can&#39;t even hold</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.120" end="00:39:57.950" style="s2">on to this too much it would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.360" end="00:40:02.510" style="s2">beautiful to to raise children I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.950" end="00:40:06.260" style="s2">know what that&#39;s like and I presume that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.510" end="00:40:09.140" style="s2">there are ways that I can develop so</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.260" end="00:40:10.700" style="s2">that I might be able to do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.140" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">fashion that&#39;s more capable than I</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.700" end="00:40:17.690" style="s2">perhaps could now mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">now let&#39;s say developing those skills</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.690" end="00:40:22.790" style="s2">from the perspective of where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:25.730" style="s2">in this conversation one part of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.790" end="00:40:28.910" style="s2">would be perhaps waking up into an</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.730" end="00:40:33.860" style="s2">inherent nature that is there waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.910" end="00:40:38.390" style="s2">be activated so it&#39;s it&#39;s embedded</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.860" end="00:40:40.580" style="s2">within me already to realize and so to</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.390" end="00:40:43.810" style="s2">the extent awakening that could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.580" end="00:40:48.620" style="s2">understood as again this kind of growth</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.810" end="00:40:49.540" style="s2">then I am awakening to something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.620" end="00:40:51.960" style="s2">has a</p>

<p begin="00:40:51.960" end="00:40:59.700" style="s2">a profound profoundly deep role</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.780" end="00:41:06.230" style="s2">narrative pattern of adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.700" end="00:41:10.140" style="s2">functioning in society in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.230" end="00:41:11.940" style="s2">and and so in that sense there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.140" end="00:41:15.060" style="s2">something in me to be awoken that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.940" end="00:41:17.640" style="s2">from one angle sort of preconceived it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.060" end="00:41:20.339" style="s2">like pre it&#39;s a it&#39;s a there&#39;s a seed</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.640" end="00:41:23.160" style="s2">that I can&#39;t evolve into something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.339" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">the manner in which it evolves and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.160" end="00:41:27.960" style="s2">particular rises it&#39;s like it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">the seed it&#39;s the seed and the ground</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.960" end="00:41:33.930" style="s2">and they sort of have to accept each</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">other and so the dance of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.930" end="00:41:39.660" style="s2">occurs between again seed and ground</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:41.880" style="s2">agent and arena me and the world in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.660" end="00:41:46.849" style="s2">case or a family you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.880" end="00:41:50.750" style="s2">relationship or whatever it is so and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.849" end="00:41:54.810" style="s2">and the seed and the ground I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.750" end="00:41:58.830" style="s2">another way to also look at it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.810" end="00:42:01.260" style="s2">perhaps the flower blooming when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.830" end="00:42:04.650" style="s2">ready mm-hmm you can&#39;t kind of force a a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.260" end="00:42:09.230" style="s2">bud to open mm-hmm but perhaps when we</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.650" end="00:42:13.530" style="s2">live in this this space of connecting to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.230" end="00:42:15.720" style="s2">where inspiration is behind the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.530" end="00:42:18.330" style="s2">conditioning we&#39;re living in a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.720" end="00:42:22.680" style="s2">that&#39;s in line with kind of nature</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.330" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">itself mm-hmm yes we&#39;re see where where</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.680" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something in me here okay so</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">this is this is another place that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">often go to in in the dance we do which</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:44.550" style="s2">is so so we&#39;ve been sort of discussing</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:48.510" style="s2">the the the surrender component the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.550" end="00:42:51.089" style="s2">relinquishing of narrative and identity</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.510" end="00:42:58.320" style="s2">have become fixed in this moment to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.089" end="00:43:04.180" style="s2">align with a novel authentic</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.320" end="00:43:06.609" style="s2">re-imagination of how to be in the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.180" end="00:43:09.430" style="s2">an important part of that process has to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.609" end="00:43:12.069" style="s2">then be okay now we&#39;re acting in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.430" end="00:43:18.010" style="s2">world now we are fixing it again now we</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.069" end="00:43:24.910" style="s2">are grasping it again and that to me is</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.010" end="00:43:28.150" style="s2">as important as being able to relinquish</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.910" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">or surrender so it&#39;s this confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.150" end="00:43:31.390" style="s2">at UC use the terms confrontation and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:34.109" style="s2">surrender to sort of articulate</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.390" end="00:43:37.349" style="s2">something like this with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.109" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">navigating psychedelic experience and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.349" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">look their words and it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:42.730" style="s2">matter like what matters is the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:44.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.730" end="00:43:46.839" style="s2">confrontation that maybe a slightly to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.440" end="00:43:51.089" style="s2">conflictual and so I would say it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.839" end="00:43:53.710" style="s2">mixture of it&#39;s a it&#39;s a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.089" end="00:43:55.720" style="s2">confrontation of grasping and again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.710" end="00:43:58.450" style="s2">about the cycle so whenever you fixate</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.720" end="00:44:00.220" style="s2">too much on one you destroy its actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.450" end="00:44:03.220" style="s2">meaning and its function because they</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.220" end="00:44:05.140" style="s2">co-occur but nevertheless we do then we</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.220" end="00:44:07.630" style="s2">do fix the world we do grasp it and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.140" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">step out and the ego the ego like</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.630" end="00:44:13.089" style="s2">bravely steps forward again in its in</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:15.690" style="s2">its vulnerable and do himself like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.089" end="00:44:18.339" style="s2">the price of it is the price of it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.690" end="00:44:21.750" style="s2">death the price of identity is death but</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.339" end="00:44:25.869" style="s2">but the identity itself is to is to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.750" end="00:44:30.789" style="s2">loved as well you know even though it it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.869" end="00:44:34.839" style="s2">cannot last must be made subservient to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.789" end="00:44:43.180" style="s2">the process of the transformation but</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.839" end="00:44:46.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah I I I&#39;m very interested</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.180" end="00:44:49.779" style="s2">in what processes in what collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.359" end="00:44:50.859" style="s2">processes enable this enable the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.779" end="00:44:53.710" style="s2">grasping as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.859" end="00:44:57.640" style="s2">right it&#39;s we have to be doing both</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.710" end="00:45:01.059" style="s2">because it you might say a shadow of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.640" end="00:45:05.349" style="s2">surrender it becomes can tend towards an</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.059" end="00:45:07.779" style="s2">apathy to or whatever comes mm-hmm there</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.349" end="00:45:11.609" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s one of it or maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.779" end="00:45:15.550" style="s2">a sense of agency that&#39;s lost maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.609" end="00:45:18.190" style="s2">maybe maybe may</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.550" end="00:45:22.500" style="s2">surrendering to hey there&#39;s a danger of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.190" end="00:45:27.400" style="s2">surrendering at the wrong time might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.500" end="00:45:29.080" style="s2">manipulation by others potentially so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.400" end="00:45:30.340" style="s2">don&#39;t know how that how that sounds how</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.080" end="00:45:32.260" style="s2">that sounds to you there there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.340" end="00:45:42.850" style="s2">different ways to take that I know so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.260" end="00:45:45.220" style="s2">mean yeah we&#39;ll mm yeah generally in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.850" end="00:45:49.390" style="s2">world at the moment I think it&#39;s fair to</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.220" end="00:45:53.830" style="s2">say that there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.390" end="00:45:57.700" style="s2">overabundance of thinking with a with a</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.830" end="00:46:01.510" style="s2">lack of of being so it&#39;s more human</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.700" end="00:46:04.540" style="s2">doing than it is human being so I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.510" end="00:46:08.530" style="s2">part of the the solution being</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.540" end="00:46:10.540" style="s2">orientated to surrender is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.530" end="00:46:12.990" style="s2">temporary mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.540" end="00:46:18.820" style="s2">just so that we can restore balance</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.990" end="00:46:23.590" style="s2">mm-hmm and there on text matters so</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.820" end="00:46:26.050" style="s2">complex eyes matter yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.590" end="00:46:30.640" style="s2">it does so in some sense it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.050" end="00:46:32.320" style="s2">and I can talk about perhaps ways to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.640" end="00:46:36.550" style="s2">with each other things we might do in</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.320" end="00:46:39.130" style="s2">the world and it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.550" end="00:46:45.190" style="s2">is where like things become so like</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.540" end="00:48:19.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s tricky it&#39;s hard because who</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:21.340" style="s2">are we who are we speaking we have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.720" end="00:48:23.830" style="s2">speak about who we speaking to we have</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:35.020" style="s2">could say it&#39;s particularly obvious in</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.770" end="00:48:41.010" style="s2">the ecological sphere in the way in</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.020" end="00:48:41.010" style="s2">which our relationship by the masses is</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.030" end="00:48:48.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s disconnected from nature</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.510" end="00:48:52.140" style="s2">mm-hmm yes I mean that&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.130" end="00:48:56.470" style="s2">and that seems to be a outer</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.140" end="00:48:58.300" style="s2">manifestation of our inner landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.470" end="00:49:07.300" style="s2">I think it&#39;s fair it&#39;s fair to say that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.300" end="00:49:09.070" style="s2">and the reason why I feel like I can say</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.300" end="00:49:13.030" style="s2">that confidently is because I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.070" end="00:49:19.090" style="s2">it in myself for sure and and I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.030" end="00:49:22.150" style="s2">that interplay even down to just the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.090" end="00:49:26.460" style="s2">I navigate the most mundane experiences</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.150" end="00:49:29.050" style="s2">in life like say making a cup of tea</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.460" end="00:49:32.530" style="s2">in my daily routine and how much</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.050" end="00:49:36.280" style="s2">presence how much attention is paid to</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.530" end="00:49:39.150" style="s2">the world and how that is a natural</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.280" end="00:49:43.630" style="s2">reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.150" end="00:49:49.480" style="s2">the way I&#39;m navigating things in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.630" end="00:49:53.380" style="s2">interior landscape mm-hmm but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.480" end="00:49:57.910" style="s2">it&#39;s also this space it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.380" end="00:50:05.710" style="s2">connecting with this space that to me is</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.910" end="00:50:08.830" style="s2">actually what meaning is it&#39;s less that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.710" end="00:50:12.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve it&#39;s less that I find meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.830" end="00:50:16.990" style="s2">particular things as much as meaning</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.460" end="00:50:24.790" style="s2">seems to be imbued in direct correlation</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.990" end="00:50:28.600" style="s2">to how present I am how how full the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.790" end="00:50:33.730" style="s2">experience of being alive or how how</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.600" end="00:50:37.630" style="s2">much a perception there is of just the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.730" end="00:50:40.570" style="s2">felt presence of experience then seems</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.630" end="00:50:43.570" style="s2">to imbue whatever is contextually</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.570" end="00:50:52.420" style="s2">happening with meaning mm-hmm it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.570" end="00:50:58.090" style="s2">a meaning full and in some ways a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.420" end="00:51:03.190" style="s2">the actions and there&#39;s a lot of seeking</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.090" end="00:51:05.740" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing in others mm-hmm mm-hmm where</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.190" end="00:51:13.810" style="s2">it seems to be what they&#39;re seeking for</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.740" end="00:51:16.300" style="s2">is what is seeking yes and so rather</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.810" end="00:51:19.750" style="s2">than point fingers at X person is doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.300" end="00:51:23.320" style="s2">this X country is doing this they should</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.750" end="00:51:27.910" style="s2">do that etc actually these seem to all</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.320" end="00:51:29.830" style="s2">be one problem actually it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.910" end="00:51:32.770" style="s2">a political problem necessary an</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.830" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">ecological problem one of conservative</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.770" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">or liberal etc it&#39;s transcending that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a rampantly untamed ego</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:58.529" style="s2">that has lost its connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:52:01.579" style="s2">source and yeah perhaps as we say as we</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.529" end="00:52:04.710" style="s2">said earlier there&#39;s this temporary need</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.579" end="00:52:07.769" style="s2">to cultivate that space again to bring</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.710" end="00:52:11.339" style="s2">harmony and through that what we should</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.769" end="00:52:13.369" style="s2">see is a natural balance with our</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.339" end="00:52:18.750" style="s2">relationship to the earth</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.369" end="00:52:23.609" style="s2">to each other politically etc it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.750" end="00:52:28.160" style="s2">almost transcends any need for more</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.609" end="00:52:32.130" style="s2">information more knowledge it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:34.260" style="s2">more wisdom and to some extent wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.130" end="00:52:37.950" style="s2">you know it&#39;s more about the embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.260" end="00:52:39.690" style="s2">of knowledge let&#39;s say yes then it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.950" end="00:52:46.410" style="s2">about accumulating thing we&#39;re drowning</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.690" end="00:52:55.650" style="s2">in knowledge mm-hmm no I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.410" end="00:52:57.779" style="s2">beautifully put I this is uh what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.650" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">about to do it&#39;s it&#39;s very selfish but</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.779" end="00:53:06.210" style="s2">ah you know good place a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:08.930" style="s2">stop there let&#39;s check it let&#39;s make</p>
