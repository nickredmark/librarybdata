<p begin="00:00:06.950" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">welcome to another episode of head first</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:14.070" style="s2">with dr. hill today&#39;s guest is Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:17.009" style="s2">schmuck Tim burger who is a co-founder</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:19.589" style="s2">and R&amp;D director of the neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.009" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">collective which sounds kind of exciting</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.589" end="00:00:23.579" style="s2">so Dan is going to tell us all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:24.599" style="s2">cool things today and dig into his</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.579" end="00:00:26.669" style="s2">history a little bit and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.599" end="00:00:28.319" style="s2">projects he&#39;s working on so welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.669" end="00:00:29.339" style="s2">the show today Daniel thanks for having</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.319" end="00:00:31.470" style="s2">me it&#39;s good to be here with you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.339" end="00:00:33.629" style="s2">happy to have you so first of all what</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">is this collective of neuro hackers you</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.629" end="00:00:40.199" style="s2">are assembling it sounds like a you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:41.960" style="s2">sort of pie-in-the-sky big project where</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.199" end="00:00:45.420" style="s2">you&#39;re hit you&#39;re aiming for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.960" end="00:00:47.190" style="s2">world-changing goals but can you unpack</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.420" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">a little bit for us what your your</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.190" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">approach here yeah so by neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">we mean anything that can optimize the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:56.609" style="s2">mind brain interface and the function</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:58.980" style="s2">thereof so this is cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.609" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">psychomotor and health and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.980" end="00:01:04.619" style="s2">and so we could roughly define it as</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">well-being optimization but even larger</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.619" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">than that we think of it as sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.649" style="s2">optimization people&#39;s capacity to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.729" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">good choices right to be adaptive which</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.649" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">is a function of intelligence of agency</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:18.719" style="s2">of sentient soul together and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.659" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">obviously a kind of human software right</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.719" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">psychology here and there&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.490" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">Hardware physiology involved and we know</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:26.810" style="s2">that&#39;s a software hardware divide in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">humans is a plastic one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.810" end="00:01:31.860" style="s2">continuously inter affecting each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">and so you know your work with</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.860" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">neurofeedback is neuro hacking the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">people you&#39;ve had on the show to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">discussing meditation etc is all in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">space so we&#39;re interested in all</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">categories of technologies that can</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">meaningfully increase the homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">capacity the dynamics as you like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">call them yeah of the human neuro</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">regulatory system and thereby increase</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">people&#39;s capacity for complex thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">emotional resilience etc and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:06.600" style="s2">why collective is anyone that is doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:08.730" style="s2">meaningful work here we want to figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.600" end="00:02:10.710" style="s2">out how we can participate at a research</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.730" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">level and at a you know information</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.710" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">product level etc so like us</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:18.450" style="s2">walking here together is is awesome</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:21.000" style="s2">shape koshering information in the space</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.450" end="00:02:23.810" style="s2">that&#39;s great so you say sovereignty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.000" end="00:02:27.270" style="s2">an interesting way to way to frame that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.810" end="00:02:29.940" style="s2">agency what do you mean by I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.270" end="00:02:34.970" style="s2">what kinds of things are bottlenecks to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.940" end="00:02:38.520" style="s2">human agency that appear to be a mere</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.970" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">affected by things we can do to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.520" end="00:02:42.780" style="s2">brain like what how can we affect agency</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">in tractable ways what are you saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.780" end="00:02:48.990" style="s2">what are you exploring yeah so by agency</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:50.850" style="s2">here we mean the the actuator capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.990" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">of a complex system the ability to act</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.850" end="00:02:55.800" style="s2">on and in the world okay send chance is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:58.530" style="s2">kind of roughly related to our scent our</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.800" end="00:03:00.030" style="s2">sensory input capacity intelligence to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.530" end="00:03:01.980" style="s2">our information processing of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.030" end="00:03:04.380" style="s2">sensory input so that those exist in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.980" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">closed-loop take in information about</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.380" end="00:03:09.300" style="s2">the world which is internal and external</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">sensing process it to inform choice make</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.300" end="00:03:14.820" style="s2">choice get that about that choice</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:17.959" style="s2">recursively upregulate and so on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.820" end="00:03:21.239" style="s2">agency side on the capacity to act</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.959" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">obviously that requires the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.239" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">have good information and information</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.920" end="00:03:26.070" style="s2">processing so there&#39;s good choice in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:28.410" style="s2">forming it right it also requires</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.070" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">impulse control yeah yeah one can</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.410" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">actually have executive function and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:36.330" style="s2">that they now come to bear it also</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">requires the it on the you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.330" end="00:03:41.010" style="s2">choice making side of it requires the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:42.989" style="s2">capacity to think through things using</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.010" end="00:03:44.880" style="s2">different frameworks right critical</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.989" end="00:03:47.910" style="s2">thinking frameworks systemic thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.880" end="00:03:51.450" style="s2">frameworks lateral thinking etc but also</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">in the agency side emotional resilience</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.450" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">is a key factor so that as one is</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:03:56.540" style="s2">working with things and difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:03:58.620" style="s2">come they can process that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.540" end="00:04:00.360" style="s2">physiologically and psychologically in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.620" end="00:04:02.430" style="s2">ways that empower them to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.360" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">learn rather than get shut down and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.430" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">when we look at the physiology of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">we know a lot about how dopamine about</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:11.549" style="s2">how adrenal hormones about how you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:13.650" style="s2">many different aspects of neural</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.549" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">chemistry and physiology are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.650" end="00:04:19.100" style="s2">one sense of drive one sense of reward</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:20.910" style="s2">dynamics that can predispose</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.100" end="00:04:23.580" style="s2">dysfunctional or more functional</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.910" end="00:04:25.500" style="s2">patterns of human behavior increased</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">sense of capacity psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.500" end="00:04:28.889" style="s2">physiologically etc</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:30.540" style="s2">so again we&#39;re back to this somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.889" end="00:04:33.540" style="s2">soft division between the software and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.540" end="00:04:35.400" style="s2">the hardware so on the hardware side</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.540" end="00:04:36.690" style="s2">things as you said like impulsivity or</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.400" end="00:04:38.220" style="s2">executive function</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.690" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">I think you&#39;e Bleakley referred to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.220" end="00:04:43.620" style="s2">working memory essentially which is from</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:45.960" style="s2">my perspective the biggest bottleneck in</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.620" end="00:04:51.450" style="s2">human performance and one that appears</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.960" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">to be the least responsive to change but</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.450" end="00:04:56.360" style="s2">also ways of thinking about emotional</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">regulation and decision-making criteria</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.360" end="00:05:00.900" style="s2">I&#39;m much more familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:03.480" style="s2">physiology side you know the biohacking</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.900" end="00:05:06.810" style="s2">idea is on the brain not the mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.480" end="00:05:08.450" style="s2">largely what are you seeing of some</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.810" end="00:05:14.760" style="s2">interesting ways that we can get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.450" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">cognitive change so the core</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.760" end="00:05:19.970" style="s2">psychological brain mind question right</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">is at the core of the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.970" end="00:05:23.310" style="s2">neuroscience the philosophy of line the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.110" end="00:05:25.260" style="s2">philosophy of science itself right</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.310" end="00:05:27.150" style="s2">because the brain mind gets into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.260" end="00:05:28.770" style="s2">brain physics and the question of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.150" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">is consciousness what is physics how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.770" end="00:05:33.090" style="s2">they interact is there bi-directional</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:34.350" style="s2">causation beyond the scope of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.090" end="00:05:35.790" style="s2">probably going to dive into here but</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.350" end="00:05:39.290" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely at the core of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.790" end="00:05:39.290" style="s2">informing the whatever you do okay so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.300" end="00:05:46.680" style="s2">how in any model of philosophy of mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.700" end="00:05:48.390" style="s2">however we address this it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.680" end="00:05:50.760" style="s2">what&#39;s happening physiologically is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.390" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">affecting one subjective experience and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.760" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">what&#39;s happening one subjective</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:59.250" style="s2">experience is being mirrored on you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:06:02.669" style="s2">affecting the physiology side and so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.250" end="00:06:05.160" style="s2">can obviously modify brain chemistry the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.669" end="00:06:06.930" style="s2">whole field of Psychiatry is focused on</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.160" end="00:06:09.030" style="s2">this right second row pharmacology and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.930" end="00:06:11.669" style="s2">not just pharmacology but neuro tech in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.030" end="00:06:14.100" style="s2">general sure sure to affect cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.669" end="00:06:19.860" style="s2">and psychological predispositions and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.100" end="00:06:22.500" style="s2">capacities we can also do practices that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.860" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">are involving one&#39;s direction of their</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.500" end="00:06:25.289" style="s2">own attention and subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:27.660" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.289" end="00:06:30.300" style="s2">behavioral therapy CBT DBT other</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.430" end="00:06:54.830" style="s2">input in there so it&#39;s not only that the</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.830" end="00:07:00.710" style="s2">is soft it&#39;s they are both Co evolving</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.710" end="00:07:04.280" style="s2">changing each others you alluded to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.390" end="00:07:05.720" style="s2">yeah I mean I have to say I&#39;m a I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.280" end="00:07:10.070" style="s2">reductionist in this space a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.720" end="00:07:11.660" style="s2">so for me the mind is simply the part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.070" end="00:07:14.600" style="s2">the brain that we are aware of and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.660" end="00:07:16.850" style="s2">experiencing and and I kind of don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.600" end="00:07:17.900" style="s2">below that I have a somewhat of a</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.900" end="00:07:21.650" style="s2">really believe in consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.320" end="00:07:32.140" style="s2">that&#39;s it there&#39;s there&#39;s there is no</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.260" end="00:07:55.790" style="s2">water has some strange kind of non-local</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.470" end="00:09:21.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a very philosophically weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:23.850" style="s2">for us to think about using the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.660" end="00:09:27.540" style="s2">intuition that we have from traditional</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.850" end="00:09:29.640" style="s2">larger particle physics yeah now we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.540" end="00:09:31.110" style="s2">historically kind of written that off as</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.640" end="00:09:33.570" style="s2">just super weird phenomena that happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.110" end="00:09:35.070" style="s2">only below atoms then cancels itself out</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.570" end="00:09:37.080" style="s2">at the level of atoms and so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.070" end="00:09:39.000" style="s2">have to worry about it the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.080" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">quantum amplification are there quantum</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.000" end="00:09:43.020" style="s2">phenomena that then affect the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:45.330" style="s2">of things at a mesoscopic level at a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.020" end="00:09:47.550" style="s2">Newtonian physics level or right uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.330" end="00:09:49.350" style="s2">so this is you know the work of Stewart</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.550" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">Kaufman the work of other people at</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.350" end="00:09:52.560" style="s2">Santa Fe Institute of complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:57.840" style="s2">the work of people like Stuart Hameroff</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.560" end="00:09:59.610" style="s2">have really shown quite clearly the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.840" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">quantum amplification does happen which</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.610" end="00:10:04.830" style="s2">means that the non-deterministic right a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:06.660" style="s2">causal phenomena at a quantum level are</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.830" end="00:10:09.020" style="s2">affecting macroscopic behavior at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.660" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">level of brains that still follows</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">determinism and I so this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:18.150" style="s2">very interesting very important weird</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:20.610" style="s2">topic and the whole topic of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.150" end="00:10:24.360" style="s2">microtubules microtubules in neurons and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.610" end="00:10:26.220" style="s2">specific and superposition dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.360" end="00:10:27.630" style="s2">quantum information processing is one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.220" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">the like kind of interesting cutting</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.630" end="00:10:33.450" style="s2">edges in the field the work of Stuart</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:38.280" style="s2">Hameroff and Roger Penrose kind of open</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.450" end="00:10:39.900" style="s2">that space up and the work of dr. honor</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.280" end="00:10:42.360" style="s2">bond there&#39;s a few people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.900" end="00:10:44.550" style="s2">working in that space and it is only</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.360" end="00:10:46.820" style="s2">scratching at the surface of what we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">claim to know well but there&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.820" end="00:10:50.490" style="s2">application happening and things like</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.470" style="s2">transcranial ultrasound that were based</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.490" end="00:10:54.270" style="s2">on the philosophy from there that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.470" end="00:10:56.040" style="s2">to be having positive result so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.270" end="00:10:57.090" style="s2">super interesting field interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.040" end="00:10:58.440" style="s2">that&#39;s oh it&#39;s wonderful thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.090" end="00:10:59.700" style="s2">unpacking that just a touch for us I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.440" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">would say one more thing about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.700" end="00:11:05.910" style="s2">the Buddhist perspective the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.460" style="s2">John Cyril idea of that the mind is what</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.730" end="00:11:20.330" style="s2">I&#39;m sure have very different</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.310" end="00:11:30.060" style="s2">in Buddhism coming from Vedanta was that</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.540" end="00:12:58.230" style="s2">different and have been replaced you</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.610" end="00:12:59.790" style="s2">know this is where it fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.230" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">breaks down for me personally in terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.790" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">of consciousness but would the you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:10.350" style="s2">the Vedanta approach say that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">cohesive sense of consciousness or is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.350" end="00:13:18.060" style="s2">emergent property of just you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:19.080" style="s2">having a meatsuit so Sanskrit has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.060" end="00:13:20.910" style="s2">more words</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.080" end="00:13:22.890" style="s2">that have a lot more specificity in</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.910" end="00:13:25.290" style="s2">their definition than just consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.890" end="00:13:26.640" style="s2">and self-awareness and they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.290" end="00:13:30.870" style="s2">very key distinctions in their</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.640" end="00:13:32.220" style="s2">philosophic system okay and again there</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.870" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">are different interpretations and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.220" end="00:13:37.710" style="s2">these systems but the Buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:39.870" style="s2">traditionally say that the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.710" end="00:13:43.020" style="s2">reality is neither self nor non-self</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.870" end="00:13:45.030" style="s2">because that distinction doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.020" end="00:13:46.890" style="s2">at that level that the rational</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.030" end="00:13:48.990" style="s2">distinction of the concept of self other</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.890" end="00:13:50.640" style="s2">than self is more superficial than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.990" end="00:13:52.890" style="s2">foundation of reality right it&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.640" end="00:13:56.040" style="s2">ontological a less primary okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.890" end="00:13:58.260" style="s2">idea that it&#39;s non self or the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.040" end="00:14:00.150" style="s2">it&#39;s self are inadequate so what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.260" end="00:14:02.910" style="s2">think of as self is self other than self</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.150" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">division right they talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.910" end="00:14:07.770" style="s2">foundational oneness beyond division it</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:10.500" style="s2">would be neither of those concepts right</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.770" end="00:14:13.650" style="s2">not self nor non self that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.500" end="00:14:15.690" style="s2">than the traditional way that is spoken</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.650" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">about in Vedanta which is that at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.690" end="00:14:22.250" style="s2">foundation of all of it there is</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.350" end="00:14:25.560" style="s2">consciousness with a capital C that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.250" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">that is different than self right that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.560" end="00:14:30.630" style="s2">can hmm this is basically if you think</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:34.430" style="s2">about it almost in terms of a unified</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.630" end="00:14:34.430" style="s2">field of physics as a field of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.240" end="00:14:40.350" style="s2">potentiality for dynamics to occur in</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.250" end="00:14:41.820" style="s2">quantum foam to emerge from etc that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.350" end="00:14:43.170" style="s2">there is reference happening but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.820" end="00:14:44.550" style="s2">referenced within the only thing there</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.170" end="00:14:48.030" style="s2">is other self reference and that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.550" end="00:14:51.020" style="s2">foundation of what we think of as self</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.030" end="00:14:53.850" style="s2">referentiality happens at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.020" end="00:14:55.790" style="s2">Unified Field interesting now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.850" end="00:14:58.290" style="s2">saying this is what I think but this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.790" end="00:15:00.210" style="s2">some of the kind of interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.290" end="00:15:03.260" style="s2">there I will say there are real problems</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.210" end="00:15:05.160" style="s2">with most of the models of physicalism</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.260" end="00:15:06.750" style="s2">there are real problems with these</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.160" end="00:15:08.700" style="s2">models and this is why these are</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.750" end="00:15:10.560" style="s2">unsolved famous problems in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.700" end="00:15:12.390" style="s2">and you even see like you&#39;ll see a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.560" end="00:15:14.310" style="s2">couple physical lists like the classic</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.390" end="00:15:16.860" style="s2">debate that Sam Harris and Dan Dennett</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.310" end="00:15:21.650" style="s2">had under Sam wrote has become free will</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:23.820" style="s2">was that Dan fundamentally said</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.650" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">consciousness isn&#39;t real maybe is a</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:30.390" style="s2">but freewill is real and Sam said</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.380" end="00:15:32.100" style="s2">consciousness is fundamentally real an</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.390" end="00:15:32.850" style="s2">emergent property of brain but freewill</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.100" end="00:15:34.829" style="s2">is available</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.850" end="00:15:36.389" style="s2">is a core disagreement on the most</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.829" end="00:15:39.889" style="s2">foundational concepts of existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.389" end="00:15:42.779" style="s2">of what actually is both being</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.889" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">physicalists and having the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.779" end="00:15:47.250" style="s2">critical thinking background agreeing on</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:48.600" style="s2">a lot of other things so it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.250" end="00:15:51.569" style="s2">why these have been so hard as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.600" end="00:15:53.160" style="s2">beyond our current tools of knowing my</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.569" end="00:15:55.500" style="s2">pistol my logic tools when we do science</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.160" end="00:15:57.990" style="s2">we are studying third-person things</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.500" end="00:15:59.100" style="s2">that&#39;s very sure do so when we try and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.990" end="00:16:00.660" style="s2">study consciousness which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.100" end="00:16:03.089" style="s2">first-person by looking at the</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.089" end="00:16:07.110" style="s2">actually doing a category mistake mmm by</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.850" end="00:16:09.269" style="s2">assuming that they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.110" end="00:16:11.370" style="s2">also when we assume causation when we</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.269" end="00:16:14.149" style="s2">get to the level of things that are for</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.370" end="00:16:18.029" style="s2">sure via Bell&#39;s Theorem a causal our</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.149" end="00:16:20.069" style="s2">intuitions get off right and so these</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.029" end="00:16:21.660" style="s2">are fascinating and tricky areas what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.069" end="00:16:25.649" style="s2">can say at the level of what&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.660" end="00:16:28.829" style="s2">useful for people right now is that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.649" end="00:16:31.949" style="s2">can do things with our own subjective</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.829" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">experience of self so what we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.949" end="00:16:37.439" style="s2">we put our attention and the meaning we</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:39.750" style="s2">give to things that has a real effect on</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.439" end="00:16:41.310" style="s2">brain and physiology and we can do</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.750" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">things to our physiology that are not</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.310" end="00:16:45.630" style="s2">obviously utilizing our subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:48.899" style="s2">that will affect our subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.630" end="00:16:51.420" style="s2">there can be recursive effects between</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.899" end="00:16:53.459" style="s2">subjective and objective that can either</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.420" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">depending upon how you do them have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.459" end="00:16:58.410" style="s2">potential of being virtuous cycles in</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:17:01.350" style="s2">more adaptive evolutionary directions or</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.410" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">vicious cycles and so learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.350" end="00:17:07.049" style="s2">use both the conscious direction of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:09.089" style="s2">thought awareness attention and what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.049" end="00:17:11.130" style="s2">do with our physiology in mutually</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.089" end="00:17:12.990" style="s2">reinforcing adaptive ways is I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.130" end="00:17:14.760" style="s2">what we&#39;re interested in wow it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.990" end="00:17:17.850" style="s2">heady stuff no pun intended till you</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.760" end="00:17:19.169" style="s2">taste like a philosophy a guy he read</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.850" end="00:17:22.020" style="s2">you have a philosophy background yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.169" end="00:17:26.760" style="s2">yeah tell us about that what is your</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.020" end="00:17:28.530" style="s2">when he&#39;s returning been there uh so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.760" end="00:17:30.450" style="s2">was home-schooled growing out okay and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.530" end="00:17:32.309" style="s2">all the sciences and all the philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.450" end="00:17:34.980" style="s2">traditions were what I was fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.309" end="00:17:36.510" style="s2">and so a particular home school didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.980" end="00:17:38.030" style="s2">have curriculum so I just got to study</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.510" end="00:17:40.169" style="s2">what I wanted to know was</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.030" end="00:17:42.690" style="s2">interdisciplinary science system science</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.169" end="00:17:45.659" style="s2">and the various philosophic traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.690" end="00:17:46.659" style="s2">because the the impulse to study science</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.659" end="00:17:48.789" style="s2">was impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.659" end="00:17:50.649" style="s2">understand the nature of reality we live</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.789" end="00:17:53.940" style="s2">in sure better yeah which is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.649" end="00:17:57.609" style="s2">philosophic impulse right science is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.940" end="00:17:59.649" style="s2">method of knowing that correlates to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.609" end="00:18:01.899" style="s2">particular philosophic system right</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.649" end="00:18:04.119" style="s2">philosophical system usually a logical</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.899" end="00:18:06.789" style="s2">positivism or the idea that reality</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.119" end="00:18:08.139" style="s2">exists objectively objective stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.789" end="00:18:10.450" style="s2">real we can measure it get the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.139" end="00:18:11.950" style="s2">results so science is a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.450" end="00:18:14.379" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s a particularly useful</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.950" end="00:18:16.989" style="s2">meaningful one it doesn&#39;t happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.379" end="00:18:20.710" style="s2">an exhaustive one of all sure assurance</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.989" end="00:18:22.869" style="s2">yeah yeah and so fortunately got to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.710" end="00:18:25.779" style="s2">study many different Eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.869" end="00:18:29.049" style="s2">and Western traditions and my early and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.779" end="00:18:30.519" style="s2">then you know deeply in my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.049" end="00:18:33.190" style="s2">method of understanding any new</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.200" end="00:18:42.340" style="s2">understand the range of opinions on that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.359" end="00:18:43.899" style="s2">and why and then go back and understand</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.299" end="00:19:42.220" style="s2">bio hacking and what the hard problems</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.359" end="00:19:44.729" style="s2">are in medicine and we kind of looking</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.220" end="00:19:47.109" style="s2">at that as medicine moving from</p>

<p begin="00:19:57.429" end="00:20:00.130" style="s2">that are not like philosophically hard</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.259" end="00:20:02.230" style="s2">problems and</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.169" end="00:20:17.380" style="s2">complexity okay and so when we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.429" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">to look at what&#39;s going on for an</p>

<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">look at addressing anxiety for someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.470" end="00:20:33.730" style="s2">is their anxiety primarily physio genic</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:35.530" style="s2">or psychogenic and what causes in each</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.730" end="00:20:38.500" style="s2">of those if we just look at physio genic</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.530" end="00:20:40.470" style="s2">physiologic causes we see a whole good</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.500" end="00:20:43.659" style="s2">body of work on the ability for</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.470" end="00:20:46.870" style="s2">microbial imbalances in the gut to cause</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.309" end="00:21:06.700" style="s2">that could be a tier one cause of</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.700" end="00:21:14.289" style="s2">CBT or DBT assures yeah yeah or if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.900" end="00:21:16.030" style="s2">had minor head trauma where the cat scan</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.289" end="00:21:18.370" style="s2">or the MRI didn&#39;t show anything but</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.030" end="00:21:19.120" style="s2">maybe a qejy would or maybe a SPECT scan</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.370" end="00:21:20.440" style="s2">which is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.120" end="00:21:22.330" style="s2">you know functional fire hydrant sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.440" end="00:21:24.250" style="s2">went off how we&#39;re going to address that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.330" end="00:21:26.110" style="s2">that might require neurofeedback that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.250" end="00:21:27.820" style="s2">might require neurogenic chemistry right</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.110" end="00:21:31.030" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be totally different</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.820" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">again if they were exposed to mold or</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.030" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">other forms of cytotoxic sure that can</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:39.970" style="s2">cause anxiety it so there can be genetic</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:41.950" style="s2">predispositions there and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.970" end="00:21:43.950" style="s2">we can continue to populate there can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.950" end="00:21:46.539" style="s2">methylation disorders right there surely</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.950" end="00:21:48.610" style="s2">thousands of different things and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.539" end="00:21:49.809" style="s2">the confluence of those things right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.610" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">then if we&#39;re looking at the psychogenic</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.809" end="00:21:54.220" style="s2">side event we&#39;re saying someone who had</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:56.140" style="s2">anxiety since childhood because of kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.220" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">of attachment early childhood attachment</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.140" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">stuff of parents versus only after a</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:05.350" style="s2">crowder are sure they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.820" end="00:22:06.970" style="s2">different psychologically they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.350" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">different neurologically and there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.970" end="00:22:11.020" style="s2">different best practices and therapies</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:13.179" style="s2">to address all these things and for one</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.020" end="00:22:13.990" style="s2">particular person&#39;s anxiety we might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.179" end="00:22:15.640" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.990" end="00:22:17.830" style="s2">some confluence of some number of these</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.110" end="00:22:25.000" style="s2">anxiety maybe also has a sleep issue or</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.539" end="00:22:26.830" style="s2">not or maybe also has some autoimmunity</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.000" end="00:22:30.279" style="s2">or so as we&#39;re trying to help them are</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.830" end="00:22:32.890" style="s2">we how do we factor all yeah certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.279" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">complexity and personalization yeah is</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.890" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">this possible I mean I I work with</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:40.270" style="s2">brains every day and I am humbled every</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:42.850" style="s2">day by how little I actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.270" end="00:22:44.770" style="s2">and my strategy for dealing with that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.850" end="00:22:47.340" style="s2">you know maslow to a man with a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.770" end="00:22:50.049" style="s2">every problems a nail my hammer is</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.340" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">neurofeedback in meditation and to some</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.049" end="00:22:54.549" style="s2">extent nootropics but I view the brain</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:56.140" style="s2">as a regulatory machine and when I do a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.549" end="00:22:58.120" style="s2">QE G and see something off and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.140" end="00:22:59.529" style="s2">matches symptoms it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.120" end="00:23:01.480" style="s2">little bit more skill than being a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.529" end="00:23:03.159" style="s2">mechanic perhaps but it&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.480" end="00:23:05.789" style="s2">approached it to be let me go region</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.159" end="00:23:08.710" style="s2">twins wake this and see what happens I</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.789" end="00:23:10.659" style="s2">would I mean I&#39;m working on integrating</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.710" end="00:23:13.149" style="s2">lots of different information systems so</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.659" end="00:23:15.309" style="s2">that I can you know do visualization do</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.149" end="00:23:18.549" style="s2">big data do a better sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.309" end="00:23:21.549" style="s2">happening but even that will have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.549" end="00:23:24.190" style="s2">fraction of the type of the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.549" end="00:23:26.110" style="s2">things you&#39;re talking about right is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.190" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">a solvable problem can we actually bring</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.110" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">in personalized medicine if you will</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:33.309" style="s2">personalized psychology track data this</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:35.289" style="s2">way I mean is this being done can we do</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.309" end="00:23:36.970" style="s2">it I think we&#39;re getting enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.289" end="00:23:38.289" style="s2">information about the the individual</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.970" end="00:23:40.179" style="s2">data points you can do a methylation</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.289" end="00:23:43.450" style="s2">analysis you can do a theta beta ratio</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.179" end="00:23:47.320" style="s2">you can do you know a blood flow imaging</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.450" end="00:23:51.250" style="s2">or something but these measurement tools</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.320" end="00:23:53.320" style="s2">are limited by the tool space that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.250" end="00:23:56.020" style="s2">are using and qejy gives me one thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.320" end="00:23:57.730" style="s2">because me less than half the EEG only</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.250" end="00:24:08.340" style="s2">several minutes so you&#39;re missing states</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.340" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">the this you know 30 or 40 big features</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.620" end="00:24:15.850" style="s2">in the Q EEG that I look at and then I</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:18.010" style="s2">operate on in terms of intervening but</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.850" end="00:24:21.730" style="s2">it&#39;s I default back to that because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.010" end="00:24:23.320" style="s2">can&#39;t do everything because I can&#39;t hold</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.620" end="00:24:34.850" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the brain fully I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.710" end="00:24:36.440" style="s2">as you say probably none of us do are we</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.850" end="00:24:39.289" style="s2">getting to the place where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.440" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">to be able to aggregate and analyze and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.289" end="00:24:43.250" style="s2">extract meaning from this complexity or</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:46.760" style="s2">is the complexity because I&#39;ve secured</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.250" end="00:24:49.210" style="s2">our ability to know what&#39;s real I know</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.760" end="00:24:51.559" style="s2">it&#39;s important yeah I do believe we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.210" end="00:24:53.659" style="s2">starting in the next few years okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.559" end="00:24:56.870" style="s2">having an exponential curve this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.659" end="00:25:00.440" style="s2">Kurtz wily and predicting here sorts out</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.870" end="00:25:02.690" style="s2">in a different direction than rank much</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.440" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">of what we hear about what is going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.690" end="00:25:08.000" style="s2">happen with brains from singularity okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:08.809" style="s2">as you said we can&#39;t hold it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.000" end="00:25:11.779" style="s2">hold it on your brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.809" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">okay total amount of information exceeds</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.779" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">our conscious processing by a lot mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:19.370" style="s2">because of working memory limits mostly</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:20.929" style="s2">right yeah there&#39;s a storage limit the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.370" end="00:25:22.490" style="s2">brain as far as we can tell but there is</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.020" end="00:25:38.929" style="s2">the genome most things aren&#39;t affected</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.779" end="00:25:40.460" style="s2">by by snips right by one snip there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.929" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">very few things that are mostly we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.460" end="00:25:45.320" style="s2">looking at dynamics combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:47.470" style="s2">dynamics across tens or hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.320" end="00:25:49.880" style="s2">thousands three effects essentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.470" end="00:25:51.559" style="s2">right and but that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot when</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.880" end="00:25:54.950" style="s2">you look at you know three billion base</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.559" end="00:25:57.380" style="s2">pairs yeah and then we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.950" end="00:25:59.570" style="s2">the fact that that doesn&#39;t tell us which</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.380" end="00:26:01.070" style="s2">ones are actually coding right we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.570" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">to look at the epigenome for that which</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.070" end="00:26:04.940" style="s2">is not something we do well right now so</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.830" style="s2">we have to look at the transcriptome or</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.940" end="00:26:10.940" style="s2">eggs Omega proteome which is all stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.830" end="00:26:13.070" style="s2">that is emerging but hard and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.940" end="00:26:14.990" style="s2">just the human genes which is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.070" end="00:26:16.909" style="s2">actually the majority of the genes we</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.990" end="00:26:19.460" style="s2">carry around or actually art ours are</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.909" end="00:26:21.350" style="s2">human right so so if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.460" end="00:26:22.820" style="s2">this way right when you&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.350" end="00:26:24.590" style="s2">brain is regulatory system it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.820" end="00:26:26.210" style="s2">top-down regulatory says right the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.590" end="00:26:28.700" style="s2">bottom-up regulatory system is the code</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.210" end="00:26:30.649" style="s2">layer the genomics the microbiome except</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.700" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">I romics right they are creating a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.649" end="00:26:35.029" style="s2">distributed bottom-up regulation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:38.210" style="s2">individual cell function right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.029" end="00:26:41.090" style="s2">routine code is sure sure that bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.210" end="00:26:43.220" style="s2">regulatory capacity is what led to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.090" end="00:26:45.259" style="s2">the evolutionist top-down regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.220" end="00:26:47.509" style="s2">capacities that get to control larger</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.259" end="00:26:49.610" style="s2">groups of cells and tissues working</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.509" end="00:26:51.950" style="s2">together in coordination the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.610" end="00:26:53.389" style="s2">relationships between the bottom up and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.950" end="00:26:55.490" style="s2">the top down regulatory systems and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.389" end="00:26:58.220" style="s2">the dynamics in between is where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.490" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">what I think we&#39;re starting to do is map</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.220" end="00:27:04.370" style="s2">the human as a cybernetic organism okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:06.440" style="s2">right as a regulatory organism Plex</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.370" end="00:27:08.659" style="s2">adaptive system science and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.440" end="00:27:10.879" style="s2">systems modeling to understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.659" end="00:27:12.499" style="s2">better and it is what in computer</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.879" end="00:27:14.869" style="s2">science is called a np-complete issue</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.499" end="00:27:16.429" style="s2">it&#39;s an uncomputable issue okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.869" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">an uncomputable amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.429" end="00:27:20.690" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re not just going to brute force</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:22.639" style="s2">big data and machine learning and figure</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.690" end="00:27:24.759" style="s2">it all out well to chaotic system we</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.639" end="00:27:28.840" style="s2">have we do not have infinite precision</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.759" end="00:27:32.119" style="s2">therefore any model that steps into time</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.840" end="00:27:36.669" style="s2">far at all diverges from the chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.119" end="00:27:38.179" style="s2">system and so yes chaotic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.669" end="00:27:40.190" style="s2">there&#39;s some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.179" end="00:27:42.249" style="s2">unpredictability there our measurement</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.190" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">limits and then there&#39;s there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.249" end="00:27:47.179" style="s2">uncomputable complexity and so what that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:49.450" style="s2">means is rather than just depend on</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.179" end="00:27:52.909" style="s2">brute force computation we have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.450" end="00:27:54.649" style="s2">understand the dynamics of causation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.909" end="00:27:56.659" style="s2">a complex system better so we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.649" end="00:27:58.009" style="s2">compute the things that actually seem</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.659" end="00:28:00.529" style="s2">like they would make sense to happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.009" end="00:28:01.940" style="s2">right that&#39;s the modeling part I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.529" end="00:28:03.619" style="s2">the modeling part is key and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.940" end="00:28:07.639" style="s2">neuro hoc are what we&#39;re really focused</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.619" end="00:28:09.769" style="s2">on is taking models like cybernetics</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.639" end="00:28:12.919" style="s2">right like complex adaptive systems and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.769" end="00:28:14.690" style="s2">like information theory and putting what</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.919" end="00:28:16.549" style="s2">we understand from human biology and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.690" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">medicine into those more complex models</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.549" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">to understand dynamics better right</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:22.549" style="s2">complex dynamics and getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:24.409" style="s2">place where we can start to aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.549" end="00:28:28.009" style="s2">tremendous amounts of data there and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.409" end="00:28:31.460" style="s2">that of it is has progressively better</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.009" end="00:28:33.619" style="s2">sensitivity and specificity and then be</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.460" end="00:28:35.059" style="s2">able to process that data where you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.619" end="00:28:37.129" style="s2">right now for the most part when we look</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.059" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">at a biometric we look at someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.129" end="00:28:39.740" style="s2">hemoglobin or their vitamin D or</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:42.590" style="s2">whatever we&#39;re looking at in</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.740" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">relationship to a reference range sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.590" end="00:28:48.889" style="s2">but when we look at someone&#39;s someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:50.659" style="s2">has a kind of dynamic homeostasis right</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.889" end="00:28:52.009" style="s2">I actually really like it we&#39;re at homeo</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.659" end="00:28:53.559" style="s2">dynamics it&#39;s a better word because the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.009" end="00:28:55.309" style="s2">stasis is nonsense as you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.559" end="00:28:57.559" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.309" end="00:29:01.519" style="s2">I need your response right here the word</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.559" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">homeostasis sure life is not stasis we</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.519" end="00:29:07.970" style="s2">have these homeo dynamic yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:10.129" style="s2">thriving health has to do with the homeo</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.970" end="00:29:12.440" style="s2">dynamic capacity and resilience across</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.129" end="00:29:15.620" style="s2">all of those homeo dynamic axes right</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.440" end="00:29:18.139" style="s2">mm-hmm aging is decreased homeo dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.620" end="00:29:20.659" style="s2">capacity across some of the axes does</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.139" end="00:29:25.309" style="s2">that mean decreased range of variability</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.659" end="00:29:27.710" style="s2">in actually decreased capacity to have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.309" end="00:29:29.419" style="s2">stressor right some things that&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.710" end="00:29:32.090" style="s2">to create deviation from homeostasis and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.419" end="00:29:36.049" style="s2">the ability to stay within the homeo</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.090" end="00:29:38.149" style="s2">dynamic range so then if which means</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.049" end="00:29:40.669" style="s2">less resilience so to be concrete things</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.149" end="00:29:42.190" style="s2">like insulin or cortisol rotla to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.669" end="00:29:45.379" style="s2">insulin rises when you consume sugar</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.190" end="00:29:47.659" style="s2">right when you know it&#39;s a signaling</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.379" end="00:29:50.710" style="s2">molecule cells suck up the glucose</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.659" end="00:29:52.909" style="s2">insulin goes back down to chronically</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.710" end="00:29:54.470" style="s2">pretty sure the insulin system to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.909" end="00:29:57.110" style="s2">top of its range eventually it stops</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.470" end="00:29:59.629" style="s2">varying and we call that type 2 diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.110" end="00:30:01.730" style="s2">and on the way there the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.629" end="00:30:03.289" style="s2">syndrome X dynamics where fasting</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.730" end="00:30:05.480" style="s2">insulin levels raise you get insulin</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.289" end="00:30:06.830" style="s2">resistance at the level cells now you</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.480" end="00:30:08.179" style="s2">take sugar and in your blood sugar is</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.830" end="00:30:08.860" style="s2">going to go further out of balance no</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.179" end="00:30:11.539" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.860" end="00:30:13.159" style="s2">causing more effect on other systems are</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.539" end="00:30:16.749" style="s2">affected by blood sugar so more than</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.159" end="00:30:19.190" style="s2">pathophysiology so we&#39;re defining here</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.749" end="00:30:22.549" style="s2">aging is not disease because disease</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.190" end="00:30:25.539" style="s2">we&#39;d actually say is the deviation from</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.549" end="00:30:28.309" style="s2">homeostatic range or homeo dynamic range</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.539" end="00:30:30.700" style="s2">where some metric actually goes out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.309" end="00:30:33.169" style="s2">effective range and then you get a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.700" end="00:30:35.509" style="s2">pathophysiologic cascade okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.169" end="00:30:37.100" style="s2">so aging is not that it&#39;s the increased</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.509" end="00:30:38.539" style="s2">susceptibility for that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.100" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">increased susceptibility for disease</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.539" end="00:30:43.879" style="s2">because someone could have all of their</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:46.519" style="s2">markers within homeostatic state range</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.879" end="00:30:48.440" style="s2">mm-hmm but more sensitive to them being</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.519" end="00:30:50.629" style="s2">able to go out of range from whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.440" end="00:30:52.549" style="s2">stresses so they&#39;re less label to sit in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.629" end="00:30:55.159" style="s2">the in the in the healthy basin of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.549" end="00:30:57.559" style="s2">phase space so to speak right okay sorry</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.159" end="00:31:01.090" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re interested in here is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.559" end="00:31:03.350" style="s2">how do we where someone already has</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.090" end="00:31:05.750" style="s2">disease dynamics going on how do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.350" end="00:31:07.669" style="s2">identify specifically what caused</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.750" end="00:31:08.500" style="s2">deviation from homeostasis on which</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.669" end="00:31:10.630" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.500" end="00:31:12.040" style="s2">what was the causal cascade that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.630" end="00:31:13.900" style="s2">happened and how do we specifically</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.040" end="00:31:17.380" style="s2">reverse it like we mentioned with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.900" end="00:31:19.210" style="s2">anxiety are we are we keel ating</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.380" end="00:31:20.770" style="s2">neurotoxins or are we fixing the gut</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.210" end="00:31:22.870" style="s2">brain access or those are very different</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.770" end="00:31:25.150" style="s2">things that require specific addressing</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.870" end="00:31:27.340" style="s2">of what the causal cascade was so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.150" end="00:31:30.580" style="s2">is not let&#39;s say going to insulin the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.340" end="00:31:32.560" style="s2">insulin insensitivity that cells</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.580" end="00:31:34.840" style="s2">experience after high levels of insulin</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.560" end="00:31:38.010" style="s2">that&#39;s not the disease itself that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.840" end="00:31:40.270" style="s2">the failure of the dynamic range correct</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.010" end="00:31:42.580" style="s2">and we call these diseases things like</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.270" end="00:31:45.400" style="s2">diabetes and Alzheimer&#39;s or other things</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.580" end="00:31:47.350" style="s2">because of the failure now there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.400" end="00:31:49.420" style="s2">some people who get type 2 diabetes who</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.350" end="00:31:51.040" style="s2">did not consume too much carbohydrates</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.420" end="00:31:53.170" style="s2">relative to what they burn but they are</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.040" end="00:31:55.390" style="s2">deficient in chromium or vanadium that</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.170" end="00:31:58.150" style="s2">are nary to actually have insulin</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.390" end="00:31:59.740" style="s2">process that receptors so there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.150" end="00:32:01.180" style="s2">other dynamics that can go on which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.740" end="00:32:03.820" style="s2">why we actually have to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.180" end="00:32:05.620" style="s2">are what is the entire causal phase</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.820" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">space of what can cause an imbalance all</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.620" end="00:32:09.700" style="s2">the things that could be involved and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:12.730" style="s2">this is what we&#39;ve sucked at at medicine</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.700" end="00:32:14.650" style="s2">so far is dealing with complex causation</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.730" end="00:32:16.660" style="s2">yeah feud causation straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.650" end="00:32:20.110" style="s2">right so injury pretty straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.660" end="00:32:23.080" style="s2">and so we&#39;re going to be able to address</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.110" end="00:32:24.700" style="s2">that in a clearer way but where the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.080" end="00:32:26.680" style="s2">causation is either delayed in time</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.700" end="00:32:29.350" style="s2">right so something happened and it led</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.680" end="00:32:31.630" style="s2">to a slow deviation from homeo dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.350" end="00:32:33.250" style="s2">over the course of years or decades it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.630" end="00:32:35.110" style="s2">hard to assess what it was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.250" end="00:32:37.150" style="s2">or where it&#39;s multifactorial there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.110" end="00:32:39.220" style="s2">many different things going on and where</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.150" end="00:32:40.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a combination of some</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.220" end="00:32:43.390" style="s2">multifactorial set that&#39;s different for</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.780" end="00:32:45.730" style="s2">different people so I don&#39;t think ms is</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.390" end="00:32:47.160" style="s2">a disease I think it is and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.730" end="00:32:49.570" style="s2">think Alzheimer&#39;s is a disease or</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.160" end="00:32:52.780" style="s2">anxiety I think they are conditions</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.570" end="00:32:54.400" style="s2">where some cluster of symptoms and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.780" end="00:32:56.980" style="s2">biomarkers come together what we call</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.400" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">with that but the actual causal etiology</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.980" end="00:32:59.890" style="s2">going into it can be radically different</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:02.230" style="s2">from one person to the next so Laurie</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.890" end="00:33:04.200" style="s2">syndrome less of a disease a cluster of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.230" end="00:33:07.210" style="s2">symptoms that may have multiple causal</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.200" end="00:33:11.700" style="s2">features interesting I saw a study out</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.210" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">of UCLA a couple weeks ago that suggests</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.700" end="00:33:16.030" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s insulin insensitivity if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:17.350" style="s2">will can be reduced simply through</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.030" end="00:33:19.960" style="s2">behavioral mechanism to a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.350" end="00:33:22.179" style="s2">people off of all the meds off of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.960" end="00:33:23.980" style="s2">anything instead of doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.179" end="00:33:26.440" style="s2">specific intervention they said let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.980" end="00:33:28.559" style="s2">lifestyle things and did you know paleo</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.440" end="00:33:30.669" style="s2">diets and exercise and lo and behold</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.559" end="00:33:34.899" style="s2">symptomatic Alzheimer&#39;s individuals</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.669" end="00:33:36.639" style="s2">showed recovery of some function this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.899" end="00:33:39.789" style="s2">fairly magical things there was a study</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.639" end="00:33:41.320" style="s2">out a couple weeks ago showing that even</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.789" end="00:33:44.350" style="s2">in people with type 2 and type 1</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.320" end="00:33:45.610" style="s2">diabetes who have no beta islet cells</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.350" end="00:33:48.490" style="s2">essentially anymore in their pancreas</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.610" end="00:33:50.350" style="s2">producing insulin short period of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.490" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">fasting if it was 12 or 24 hours a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.350" end="00:33:55.690" style="s2">short period seems to cause a read if ur</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:58.059" style="s2">enchi a ssin of non beta islet cells</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.690" end="00:34:00.700" style="s2">into beta islet cells to produce insulin</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.059" end="00:34:02.860" style="s2">right that flies in the face of what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.700" end="00:34:04.899" style="s2">thought of in the disease model diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.860" end="00:34:07.179" style="s2">where it&#39;s either autoimmune or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.899" end="00:34:09.879" style="s2">toxic from the sugar essentially that</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.179" end="00:34:12.129" style="s2">kills in some person cells once they go</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.879" end="00:34:13.510" style="s2">on to gone that does not appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.129" end="00:34:15.250" style="s2">accurate is this the kind of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.510" end="00:34:16.659" style="s2">your your listing is the main thing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.250" end="00:34:18.099" style="s2">the idea that we don&#39;t produce new</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.659" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">neurons right that was an old idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.099" end="00:34:21.639" style="s2">driven we realized you know Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:23.020" style="s2">happens and it can be up regulated yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.639" end="00:34:24.609" style="s2">and that it was only in three places and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.020" end="00:34:26.679" style="s2">now it&#39;s pretty much everywhere you look</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.609" end="00:34:28.899" style="s2">in the brain we&#39;re finding new actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.679" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">button stem cells so and so can we</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.899" end="00:34:32.859" style="s2">increase pluripotent stem cell</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:35.049" style="s2">production and their differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.859" end="00:34:37.480" style="s2">throughout the connectome and can we</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.049" end="00:34:39.099" style="s2">increase neural protection and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.480" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">synaptogenesis and yeah like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.099" end="00:34:43.919" style="s2">learning a lot about how that works</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:46.119" style="s2">any when you have a system that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.919" end="00:34:48.040" style="s2">generated itself it&#39;s a self generating</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.119" end="00:34:49.629" style="s2">system the idea that it just could not</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.040" end="00:34:51.579" style="s2">generate those tissues that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.629" end="00:34:53.770" style="s2">originally generated again doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.579" end="00:34:55.990" style="s2">that much sense obviously capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.770" end="00:34:58.420" style="s2">it and then the capacity decreases or</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.990" end="00:35:01.000" style="s2">turns off for some reasons those then</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.420" end="00:35:04.380" style="s2">likely are modulated to turn on again so</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.000" end="00:35:08.230" style="s2">sure when we think about life extension</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.380" end="00:35:13.079" style="s2">how do we increase progenitor stem cells</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.230" end="00:35:16.329" style="s2">hmm how do we increase the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.079" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">purging senescence structures how do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.329" end="00:35:20.829" style="s2">protect cells from senescence these are</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:23.619" style="s2">all things that happen already sure they</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.829" end="00:35:25.750" style="s2">can start happening in at suboptimal</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.619" end="00:35:27.460" style="s2">levels for a lot of reasons we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.750" end="00:35:29.230" style="s2">support them happening in optimal levels</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.460" end="00:35:31.450" style="s2">and maybe even beyond previous genetic</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.230" end="00:35:34.690" style="s2">optimality right just to give us</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.450" end="00:35:36.099" style="s2">discrete example the gerontologist teach</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.690" end="00:35:39.910" style="s2">courses in aging is a term</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.099" end="00:35:42.460" style="s2">aging called antagonistic pleiotropy the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.910" end="00:35:44.049" style="s2">idea that a mechanism that is healthy at</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.460" end="00:35:46.089" style="s2">one point in life is harmful another</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.049" end="00:35:47.559" style="s2">point in life and the telomeres you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.089" end="00:35:49.630" style="s2">the shortening end caps that prevent</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.559" end="00:35:51.400" style="s2">replication forever when you&#39;re young</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.630" end="00:35:53.859" style="s2">prevents cancer from running away with</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.400" end="00:35:56.200" style="s2">yourselves when you&#39;re old keeps</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.200" end="00:36:00.249" style="s2">cleaning themselves up and they become</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.249" end="00:36:04.660" style="s2">basically so this kind of thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.049" end="00:36:06.849" style="s2">identifying where the natural arc of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.660" end="00:36:09.279" style="s2">development may not be optimal for long</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.849" end="00:36:11.369" style="s2">term performance and turning these</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.279" end="00:36:14.559" style="s2">things back on and controlling it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.369" end="00:36:15.759" style="s2">from point of view telomeres you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.559" end="00:36:21.789" style="s2">for a long time that was of course the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.759" end="00:36:23.979" style="s2">Holy Grail in antisemitism years you</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.789" end="00:36:27.279" style="s2">know ridiculously it would probably just</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.979" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">cause huge amounts of cancer so we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.279" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">simply reach in and turn one thing on I</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:32.380" style="s2">mean this is something I struggle with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:34.140" style="s2">neurofeedback it&#39;s not reaching in and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.380" end="00:36:36.009" style="s2">dialing up and down different</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.140" end="00:36:39.430" style="s2">neurotransmitters or different you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.009" end="00:36:41.049" style="s2">brainwave ratios when I perturb a system</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.430" end="00:36:43.170" style="s2">the system reorganizes and I&#39;m never</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.049" end="00:36:46.239" style="s2">quite sure how it&#39;s going to reorganize</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.170" end="00:36:48.549" style="s2">this is uh you know little frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.239" end="00:36:50.979" style="s2">sometimes so if we think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.549" end="00:36:53.170" style="s2">increasing system resilience right</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.979" end="00:36:54.579" style="s2">homeodomain capacity because it is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.170" end="00:36:56.229" style="s2">self-organizing system and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.579" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">complexity is well beyond what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.229" end="00:37:03.460" style="s2">going to understand in a momentary view</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:05.079" style="s2">right we&#39;re never going to factor all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.460" end="00:37:07.690" style="s2">the dynamics happening probably even in</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.079" end="00:37:10.210" style="s2">one cell but we can understand the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.690" end="00:37:11.849" style="s2">dynamics that are involved in its some</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.210" end="00:37:14.559" style="s2">of the key ones in its own regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.849" end="00:37:17.950" style="s2">dynamics and how we can increase its</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.559" end="00:37:20.859" style="s2">regulatory capacity and so in general do</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.950" end="00:37:23.499" style="s2">we see things like redox signaling</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.859" end="00:37:25.869" style="s2">decreasing inefficiency in cells yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.499" end="00:37:28.509" style="s2">yeah so this is why all the nicotinamide</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.869" end="00:37:31.450" style="s2">right aside stuff has been so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.509" end="00:37:33.069" style="s2">up regulate the NAD+ NADH ratio there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.450" end="00:37:35.529" style="s2">a lot of cool things that happen yeah do</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.069" end="00:37:39.249" style="s2">we see a CP decreasing inside of cells</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.529" end="00:37:41.559" style="s2">yes do all the things that cells do need</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.249" end="00:37:45.099" style="s2">those chemicals sure yeah if we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.559" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">support mitochondrial biogenesis if we</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.099" end="00:37:49.420" style="s2">can support ATP production efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:53.170" style="s2">and krebs cycle upregulation yep if we</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.420" end="00:37:54.730" style="s2">support protection of the mitochondria</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.170" end="00:37:57.609" style="s2">so they don&#39;t become senescent right</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.730" end="00:37:58.630" style="s2">these are key things that what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.609" end="00:38:00.910" style="s2">is that going to do what is going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.630" end="00:38:02.559" style="s2">help the complex dynamics of everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.910" end="00:38:04.780" style="s2">the cells are doing happened better and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.559" end="00:38:07.480" style="s2">so I think those are one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.780" end="00:38:10.390" style="s2">things we so you know we were saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.480" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">earlier there are specific sources of</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.390" end="00:38:14.670" style="s2">pathology right causes of deviation from</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:16.690" style="s2">homeostasis that we want to identify</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.670" end="00:38:19.329" style="s2">specifically in Reverse you have the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.690" end="00:38:22.210" style="s2">Jin&#39;s toxins deficiencies etc then there</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.329" end="00:38:23.890" style="s2">are general system dynamics that support</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.210" end="00:38:27.069" style="s2">system resilience and we want to support</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.890" end="00:38:28.780" style="s2">those even though the effects of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.069" end="00:38:31.569" style="s2">are going to be general increase</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.780" end="00:38:34.059" style="s2">well-being in crossing systems so EEG</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.569" end="00:38:35.230" style="s2">regulation is going to produce you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.059" end="00:38:38.440" style="s2">how much is it going to affect a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.230" end="00:38:39.790" style="s2">particular gastrointestinal dynamic well</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.440" end="00:38:41.500" style="s2">it depends on what all the causal</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.790" end="00:38:43.210" style="s2">dynamic oh yeah it should move it in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.500" end="00:38:44.440" style="s2">right direction to the degree that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.210" end="00:38:46.660" style="s2">creating better sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.440" end="00:38:49.240" style="s2">parasympathetic you know ratio dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.660" end="00:38:52.930" style="s2">etc yeah so we want to in general</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.240" end="00:38:55.059" style="s2">support the homeostatic processes that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.930" end="00:38:57.430" style="s2">are fundamental and get better at</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.059" end="00:38:59.020" style="s2">diagnosing individual sources of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.430" end="00:39:00.400" style="s2">pathology and reversing them this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.020" end="00:39:02.170" style="s2">great I mean this actually ties into how</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.400" end="00:39:03.339" style="s2">I often frame there a feedback for</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.170" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">people and they say oh how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.339" end="00:39:08.260" style="s2">and I&#39;ll say well we&#39;re probably going</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:10.450" style="s2">to give you more resources and all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.260" end="00:39:12.010" style="s2">regulatory domains of sleep stress and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.450" end="00:39:14.109" style="s2">attention and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.010" end="00:39:17.170" style="s2">resilience right and we can probably</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.109" end="00:39:18.430" style="s2">reach in and do more specific things for</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.170" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">you but let&#39;s see what happens first</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.430" end="00:39:21.849" style="s2">when we bring the resilience way up and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:23.980" style="s2">get you sleeping like a rocket will and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.849" end="00:39:25.690" style="s2">being creative and flexible let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.980" end="00:39:26.980" style="s2">that for the first few weeks and then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.690" end="00:39:29.349" style="s2">can go in and try to target the thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.980" end="00:39:30.700" style="s2">you think you care about me and usually</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.349" end="00:39:32.619" style="s2">the thing that they really want to work</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.700" end="00:39:34.690" style="s2">on sorts itself out along the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.619" end="00:39:36.940" style="s2">towards just building everything that</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.690" end="00:39:40.780" style="s2">the complexity of the interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.940" end="00:39:43.450" style="s2">of everything is again why specialties</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.780" end="00:39:45.940" style="s2">have failed at complex illnesses yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.450" end="00:39:48.849" style="s2">but it&#39;s also so fascinating because you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.940" end="00:39:50.950" style="s2">know we can look at a structural issue</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.849" end="00:39:53.049" style="s2">right like a postural issue or</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.950" end="00:39:55.450" style="s2">osteoarthritis that&#39;s causing can</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.049" end="00:39:57.339" style="s2">continues inflammation within the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.450" end="00:39:59.410" style="s2">inflammatory molecules right cytokines</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.339" end="00:40:01.480" style="s2">can cross the blood-brain barrier cause</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.410" end="00:40:02.860" style="s2">neural inflammation and damage to neural</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.480" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">circuits yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.860" end="00:40:07.900" style="s2">also where the continuous pain dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:09.340" style="s2">is causing sympathetic feedback into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.900" end="00:40:10.930" style="s2">brain which then is going to cause</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:12.760" style="s2">effects on all the things the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.930" end="00:40:14.830" style="s2">regulating for helps on perspective life</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.760" end="00:40:19.270" style="s2">and what needed fixed was a structural</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.830" end="00:40:22.810" style="s2">issue in a knee right right and or mold</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.270" end="00:40:27.250" style="s2">in the environment or a runaway process</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.810" end="00:40:28.690" style="s2">of dysfunctional information processing</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.250" end="00:40:30.550" style="s2">in the brain from a particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.690" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">psychologic meaning making pattern right</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.550" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">so can can structural issues and joints</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:40.450" style="s2">or psychological patterns of focus and</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:42.310" style="s2">meaning making or things going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.450" end="00:40:44.410" style="s2">gut or affect any other system in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.310" end="00:40:46.600" style="s2">body yes this is what&#39;s fascinating is</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.410" end="00:40:49.240" style="s2">why trying to separate neurology and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.600" end="00:40:51.220" style="s2">gastroenterology and oncology has a pile</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.240" end="00:40:52.900" style="s2">here yeah and so now it&#39;s how do we</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.220" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">synthesize what we understand about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.900" end="00:40:56.230" style="s2">parts to understand what happens for</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:58.060" style="s2">whole systems and what happens across</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.230" end="00:41:00.370" style="s2">systems so now you&#39;re doing this at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.060" end="00:41:02.260" style="s2">Niraj collective this idea of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.370" end="00:41:03.820" style="s2">in different aggregate data types and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.260" end="00:41:05.650" style="s2">modeling and trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.820" end="00:41:06.970" style="s2">is the meaningful inflection points for</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.650" end="00:41:09.400" style="s2">these models where you know what wears</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.970" end="00:41:11.980" style="s2">change happening that&#39;s very you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.400" end="00:41:14.170" style="s2">high level and and those are the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.980" end="00:41:17.770" style="s2">projects that frustrate PhD students for</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.170" end="00:41:21.250" style="s2">you know 20 30 years yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.770" end="00:41:23.140" style="s2">great I&#39;m you know I&#39;m incredibly noble</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.250" end="00:41:24.910" style="s2">pursuit to enter those big questions I</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.140" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">also know you guys are doing something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.910" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">a little bit more okay here are some</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.700" style="s2">things we can actually do this a product</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:32.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve produced called qualia which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.700" end="00:41:35.380" style="s2">Ana tropics is that is it an entropic</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.410" end="00:41:37.750" style="s2">space okay do you consider it in tropic</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.380" end="00:41:39.370" style="s2">or is it more than that is that a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.750" end="00:41:41.440" style="s2">frame for it is that too limiting I</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.370" end="00:41:43.060" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fine frame as you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:44.530" style="s2">the term no tropic is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.060" end="00:41:46.980" style="s2">loosely defined in terms of how its</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.530" end="00:41:49.900" style="s2">generous yeah how do you define it</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.980" end="00:41:51.460" style="s2">well I would I would in general start by</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.900" end="00:41:54.220" style="s2">making the distinctions between brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.460" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">nutrient no tropic and smart drug which</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.220" end="00:41:58.120" style="s2">are apparently used kind of in relation</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:00.910" style="s2">to each other yeah it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.120" end="00:42:02.770" style="s2">distinguishing so brain nutrient means</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.910" end="00:42:04.630" style="s2">something that you&#39;d normally get from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.770" end="00:42:06.370" style="s2">dietary source that&#39;s critical to some</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.630" end="00:42:08.650" style="s2">part of neurologic function that can</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.370" end="00:42:11.530" style="s2">often be a suboptimal levels precursors</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.650" end="00:42:14.770" style="s2">like tyrosine all your amino acids fatty</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.530" end="00:42:16.660" style="s2">acids vitamins minerals that are part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.770" end="00:42:18.670" style="s2">neural dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.660" end="00:42:20.670" style="s2">when we talk about medical deficiency</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.670" end="00:42:23.140" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a level at which</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.670" end="00:42:25.530" style="s2">acute pathologies happening below that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.140" end="00:42:29.260" style="s2">level there&#39;s a pretty huge range</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.530" end="00:42:32.230" style="s2">between medical deficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.260" end="00:42:34.120" style="s2">optimality hmm right and so we can call</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.230" end="00:42:36.280" style="s2">that subclinical deficiency or sub</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.120" end="00:42:38.200" style="s2">optimality and so there&#39;s heaps of brain</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.280" end="00:42:39.670" style="s2">nutrients that depending upon what kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.200" end="00:42:41.860" style="s2">of tests we do we see in suboptimal</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.670" end="00:42:43.060" style="s2">levels all the time right okay vitamin D</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.860" end="00:42:44.890" style="s2">is a puck sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.060" end="00:42:47.860" style="s2">even in Southern California even in</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.890" end="00:42:50.430" style="s2">Southern California and and because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.860" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">not at a level four you know rickets</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.430" end="00:42:58.150" style="s2">right someone has a you know thirty</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:43:00.370" style="s2">vitamin D traditional medical process</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.150" end="00:43:01.690" style="s2">hasn&#39;t addressed that but when we you</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.370" end="00:43:03.880" style="s2">know have deeper insight about where</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.690" end="00:43:04.810" style="s2">optimality occurs it&#39;s a far away way</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.880" end="00:43:06.460" style="s2">which is why the vitamin D</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.810" end="00:43:09.100" style="s2">supplementation is meaningful same would</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.460" end="00:43:12.820" style="s2">be true with omega-3 or tyrosine or Nick</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.100" end="00:43:15.070" style="s2">cetera so brain nutrients that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.820" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">either hard to source adequately in diet</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.070" end="00:43:19.990" style="s2">or where modern lifestyle has used them</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:21.880" style="s2">faster so if we&#39;re talking about Heidi</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.990" end="00:43:23.560" style="s2">or stress lives where B vitamins are in</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.880" end="00:43:25.540" style="s2">a process faster or whatever those are</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.560" end="00:43:27.340" style="s2">meaningful or you&#39;re a vegan if you are</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.540" end="00:43:29.770" style="s2">eating anything with s B vitamins in it</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.340" end="00:43:32.250" style="s2">so tight you know any kind of dietary</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.770" end="00:43:35.260" style="s2">limitation yeah things to address</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.250" end="00:43:38.290" style="s2">nootropics starting with you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.260" end="00:43:39.940" style="s2">defining piracetam as that field is some</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.290" end="00:43:42.430" style="s2">chemical that can increase some aspect</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.940" end="00:43:44.260" style="s2">of cognitive function beyond baseline</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.430" end="00:43:45.460" style="s2">without meaningfully negative side</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.260" end="00:43:47.410" style="s2">effects thank you for including that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.460" end="00:43:50.710" style="s2">last piece the original definition</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.410" end="00:43:53.350" style="s2">essentially I this is one of the axes I</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.710" end="00:43:55.210" style="s2">love to grind you know I&#39;m all over the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.350" end="00:43:56.980" style="s2">new trophic forms and things and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.210" end="00:43:58.390" style="s2">tell you the number of times I have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.980" end="00:43:59.590" style="s2">resist reaching through the computer and</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.390" end="00:44:02.500" style="s2">throttling some kid who thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.590" end="00:44:03.640" style="s2">modafinil is mini trophic yeah nothing</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.500" end="00:44:05.500" style="s2">with our people with a significant side</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.500" end="00:44:08.530" style="s2">guessing you have the same perspective I</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.030" end="00:44:12.280" style="s2">do if your performance is already</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.530" end="00:44:13.930" style="s2">relatively good why would you risk side</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.280" end="00:44:17.290" style="s2">effects for small incremental</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.930" end="00:44:19.120" style="s2">improvements Supra baseline improvements</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.290" end="00:44:20.830" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to remedy a deficit that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.120" end="00:44:23.560" style="s2">okay maybe you need to risk some things</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.830" end="00:44:27.160" style="s2">to get a problem sorted out but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.560" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">understand the incredible marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.160" end="00:44:32.059" style="s2">consumer push to seek for you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:33.829" style="s2">all of these drugs and compounds that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.059" end="00:44:36.589" style="s2">have someone have very very significant</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.829" end="00:44:38.900" style="s2">side effects on the off chance that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.589" end="00:44:40.759" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be you know designed</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.900" end="00:44:43.130" style="s2">for your sort of your chemistry and give</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.759" end="00:44:45.799" style="s2">you that little boost I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.130" end="00:44:47.719" style="s2">the the philosophy feel behind that this</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.799" end="00:44:50.089" style="s2">idea that you can you can reach for</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.719" end="00:44:52.369" style="s2">something that might not be unilaterally</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.089" end="00:44:55.789" style="s2">good just in case it might you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.369" end="00:44:58.549" style="s2">that&#39;s that seems very um non nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.789" end="00:45:02.890" style="s2">you know to me so to speak so the topic</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.549" end="00:45:06.049" style="s2">of risk benefit ratio yeah is core to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.890" end="00:45:08.089" style="s2">Western medicine right and it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.049" end="00:45:09.619" style="s2">why we only have a disease model and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.089" end="00:45:13.099" style="s2">don&#39;t have an optimization model is</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.619" end="00:45:15.319" style="s2">because in the disease model there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.099" end="00:45:18.769" style="s2">risk to not treating the thing right</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.319" end="00:45:20.509" style="s2">pain problem so some risk of a treatment</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.769" end="00:45:21.890" style="s2">seems warranted sure and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.509" end="00:45:23.589" style="s2">make sure that the risk makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.890" end="00:45:25.969" style="s2">possible benefit if people are already</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.589" end="00:45:27.979" style="s2">generally healthy and this also why</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.969" end="00:45:30.710" style="s2">longevity research hasn&#39;t you know had a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.979" end="00:45:32.150" style="s2">lot of support until recently or any</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.710" end="00:45:36.499" style="s2">kind of optimization which provides been</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.150" end="00:45:39.739" style="s2">left to biohackers is how much risk can</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.499" end="00:45:41.210" style="s2">we justify for how much benefit beyond</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.739" end="00:45:43.249" style="s2">baseline right</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.210" end="00:45:46.239" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a really deep question and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.249" end="00:45:48.469" style="s2">it&#39;s a question that should be answered</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.239" end="00:45:50.119" style="s2">individually within a range that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.469" end="00:45:53.900" style="s2">reasonable for the field as a whole to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.119" end="00:45:56.029" style="s2">pursue now I think bodybuilding and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.900" end="00:46:02.950" style="s2">steroids is a classic example of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.029" end="00:46:04.999" style="s2">okay so can people perform in</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.950" end="00:46:06.229" style="s2">fundamentally increased ways with</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.999" end="00:46:07.880" style="s2">anabolic steroids that they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.229" end="00:46:08.989" style="s2">otherwise obviously right you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.880" end="00:46:11.779" style="s2">otherwise you wouldn&#39;t ban them in</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.989" end="00:46:13.279" style="s2">sports is it and you know were the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.779" end="00:46:15.609" style="s2">people who are really pioneering this</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.279" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">risking their health and if many of them</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.609" end="00:46:20.539" style="s2">experienced the downsides of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:22.700" style="s2">already totally yeah and for them at</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.539" end="00:46:23.690" style="s2">least knowing that quite clearly for</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.700" end="00:46:25.579" style="s2">many of them it was worth it because</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.690" end="00:46:27.049" style="s2">that&#39;s what they want to do right like</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.579" end="00:46:28.729" style="s2">the same reason anyone would do anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.049" end="00:46:33.979" style="s2">that was not a smart longevity decision</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.729" end="00:46:36.049" style="s2">for what the passages where and then the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.979" end="00:46:38.690" style="s2">field of steroids itself evolved from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.049" end="00:46:41.170" style="s2">lot of that experimentation to where the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.690" end="00:46:43.250" style="s2">you know that some of the Psalms today</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.170" end="00:46:45.560" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.250" end="00:46:47.930" style="s2">compared to the early anabolics have</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.560" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">radically more benefit for much less</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.930" end="00:46:52.310" style="s2">risk yep</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">partly evolved by kind of the citizen</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.310" end="00:46:55.609" style="s2">science happening in that space that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:57.770" style="s2">just for ethical reasons couldn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.609" end="00:46:59.330" style="s2">in formal ressure sure so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.770" end="00:47:00.859" style="s2">interesting topic right it is a place</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.330" end="00:47:03.080" style="s2">where citizen science is always going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.859" end="00:47:06.320" style="s2">be advancing the front edge and I would</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.080" end="00:47:07.670" style="s2">say all of the Psychonauts working with</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.320" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">deep psychedelics are in the same place</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.670" end="00:47:12.859" style="s2">and so one of the things we really like</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:14.330" style="s2">is for people who are for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.859" end="00:47:15.830" style="s2">reason inclined to do their own research</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.330" end="00:47:17.630" style="s2">give them better quantified self tools</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.830" end="00:47:19.130" style="s2">and learn from that if it&#39;s outside of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.630" end="00:47:21.380" style="s2">what we can do formal research on and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.130" end="00:47:22.880" style="s2">then you know be able to take the formal</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.380" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">research from the crowdsource to get a</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.880" end="00:47:26.950" style="s2">very big level essentially that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:33.920" style="s2">now with regard to what the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.950" end="00:47:35.480" style="s2">risk benefit dynamics are yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.920" end="00:47:37.820" style="s2">mentioned modafinil and take it further</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.480" end="00:47:39.830" style="s2">methamphetamine definitely increases</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.820" end="00:47:42.470" style="s2">certain cognitive capacities and it</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.830" end="00:47:46.970" style="s2">kills the flu virus it has a number of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.470" end="00:47:51.430" style="s2">positive medical credentials yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.970" end="00:47:54.200" style="s2">has very real side effects and so if</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.430" end="00:47:55.339" style="s2">someone is in a combat situation and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.200" end="00:47:55.790" style="s2">then you have stay awake a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.339" end="00:47:57.530" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.790" end="00:47:59.660" style="s2">they have meth might make sense right</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.530" end="00:48:03.410" style="s2">part of how those drugs were developed</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.660" end="00:48:07.099" style="s2">yeah for general use for your midterms</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.410" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not a good idea now if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.099" end="00:48:12.770" style="s2">look at how much off-label adderall and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:15.320" style="s2">modafinil and redbull and whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.770" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">you know happens for those purposes this</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.320" end="00:48:22.220" style="s2">was one of the main reasons we decided</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:24.710" style="s2">to make quality was not only are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.220" end="00:48:26.359" style="s2">down regulation and side effects pretty</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.710" end="00:48:28.430" style="s2">significant of most of those but even</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.359" end="00:48:31.240" style="s2">the positives are fairly narrow mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.430" end="00:48:33.740" style="s2">right so if you have if you use it a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.240" end="00:48:35.720" style="s2">presynaptic dopamine agonist right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.740" end="00:48:37.430" style="s2">adderall you will get increased focus</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.720" end="00:48:39.230" style="s2">but you might actually get</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.430" end="00:48:41.359" style="s2">simultaneously decreased working memory</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.230" end="00:48:44.660" style="s2">we would have seen on that is clear</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.359" end="00:48:46.369" style="s2">which is not the kind of total</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.660" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">intelligence that we&#39;re interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.369" end="00:48:51.410" style="s2">as well as you know anxiety irritability</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:53.570" style="s2">depersonalization all those other</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.410" end="00:48:55.490" style="s2">dynamics and then of course because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.570" end="00:48:57.019" style="s2">an external override of an internal</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.490" end="00:48:59.059" style="s2">regulatory system yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.019" end="00:49:00.649" style="s2">regulation independence you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.059" end="00:49:02.089" style="s2">what we&#39;re really interested in I&#39;m what</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.649" end="00:49:05.779" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.089" end="00:49:09.019" style="s2">in the space was can we understanding</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.779" end="00:49:10.609" style="s2">this system more completely and nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.019" end="00:49:11.749" style="s2">near total completely but more</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.609" end="00:49:14.509" style="s2">completely right we&#39;re not just trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.749" end="00:49:16.699" style="s2">to a single molecule intervention can we</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.509" end="00:49:18.199" style="s2">have a much more comprehensive set of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.699" end="00:49:21.559" style="s2">positive effects rather than a narrow</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.199" end="00:49:24.589" style="s2">set without the negative effects in real</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.559" end="00:49:25.999" style="s2">time and without down regulation so that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.589" end="00:49:28.069" style="s2">when someone gets off of them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.999" end="00:49:30.289" style="s2">not experiencing addiction come down but</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.069" end="00:49:32.179" style="s2">if anything experiencing long-term</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.289" end="00:49:34.759" style="s2">upregulation of the capacity of their</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.179" end="00:49:36.259" style="s2">system so that&#39;s obviously that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.759" end="00:49:38.179" style="s2">design principle with which we approach</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.259" end="00:49:40.099" style="s2">the whole space quality and all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.179" end="00:49:42.019" style="s2">products and development so follows your</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.099" end="00:49:44.479" style="s2">first product then yeah what&#39;s in it I</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.019" end="00:49:48.019" style="s2">haven&#39;t dug into the ingredients at this</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.479" end="00:49:52.909" style="s2">point so brain nutrients and no tropics</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.019" end="00:49:54.769" style="s2">okay and so as you know when people</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.909" end="00:49:56.419" style="s2">start in the no tropic space usually</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.769" end="00:49:56.719" style="s2">they dive into a seagull calling for</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.419" end="00:49:58.640" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.719" end="00:50:00.380" style="s2">shirring and so rasa Tam&#39;s and some</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.640" end="00:50:03.789" style="s2">choline donors that are like the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.380" end="00:50:06.229" style="s2">foundation for memory augmentation</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.789" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">sensory nerve motor nerve you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.229" end="00:50:13.669" style="s2">acuity etc so but which rasa thames you</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:15.319" style="s2">use are going to have a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.669" end="00:50:16.249" style="s2">differential effects and rasa taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.319" end="00:50:20.659" style="s2">impress them are very different</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.249" end="00:50:23.329" style="s2">creatures oh yeah and also are we going</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.659" end="00:50:24.769" style="s2">to address the ability for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.329" end="00:50:25.969" style="s2">acetylcholine once it&#39;s produced to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.769" end="00:50:27.679" style="s2">across the synapse are we looking at</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.859" end="00:51:02.359" style="s2">number of those so we focused on like</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.959" end="00:51:03.889" style="s2">with acetylcholine we&#39;re looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.359" end="00:51:06.619" style="s2">is the whole acetylcholine regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.889" end="00:51:09.319" style="s2">process so and how can we address any of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.619" end="00:51:10.730" style="s2">the rate limiting factors and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.319" end="00:51:12.770" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.730" end="00:51:14.539" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re acting on peripheral nerves</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.770" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">were reacting on central nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.539" end="00:51:20.599" style="s2">differentially more is what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:23.900" style="s2">be doing it the kind of pharmacodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.599" end="00:51:25.579" style="s2">and kinetics of so not just where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.900" end="00:51:27.230" style="s2">acting but how long it&#39;s operating for</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.579" end="00:51:29.869" style="s2">and those curves are things that would</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.230" end="00:51:31.220" style="s2">really look at how much acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.869" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">we&#39;re producing it so that you&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.220" end="00:51:35.690" style="s2">got not just a siedel donors which is</p>

<p begin="00:51:35.690" end="00:51:38.900" style="s2">quarantine and one of the reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:43.940" style="s2">today I know what protein doesn&#39;t kreb</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.900" end="00:51:45.529" style="s2">cycle is b5 is often a rate limiting</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.940" end="00:51:48.170" style="s2">factor for the synthesis rather the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.529" end="00:51:49.369" style="s2">acetylation of choline so you know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.170" end="00:51:51.770" style="s2">are the right ratios of those things</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.369" end="00:51:55.150" style="s2">together and then how much acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.770" end="00:51:58.130" style="s2">support for how much NMDA upregulation</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.150" end="00:51:59.569" style="s2">and then where do you get rate limiting</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.130" end="00:52:02.470" style="s2">effects in terms of the total cellular</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.569" end="00:52:05.240" style="s2">energy to process more acetylcholine and</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.470" end="00:52:07.940" style="s2">then all of that just acetylcholine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.240" end="00:52:09.980" style="s2">then we look at glutamate and typically</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.940" end="00:52:12.289" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty common that rasa terms of am</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.980" end="00:52:15.170" style="s2">packing light properties yeah certainly</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.289" end="00:52:19.190" style="s2">uh any rs.10 does and you kept which</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.170" end="00:52:21.650" style="s2">reviews know I always get confused new</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.190" end="00:52:23.539" style="s2">pep seems to have race at am like</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.650" end="00:52:25.130" style="s2">properties could not be a race at am</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.539" end="00:52:26.990" style="s2">correct I mean I look at the structure</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.130" end="00:52:30.380" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t have a protein ring that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.990" end="00:52:32.510" style="s2">correct so it called racetam like and am</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.380" end="00:52:34.910" style="s2">packing like okay as of up regulating</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.510" end="00:52:36.740" style="s2">acetylcholine uptake in the NMDA complex</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.910" end="00:52:39.260" style="s2">and up regulating glutamate uptake at</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.740" end="00:52:41.539" style="s2">the AMPA complex but it is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.260" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">structurally either of them okay but</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.539" end="00:52:46.130" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting it&#39;s a precursor</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:48.529" style="s2">to cyclopropyl glycine it is neuro</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.130" end="00:52:50.900" style="s2">protective it&#39;s anti excited is anti</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.529" end="00:52:52.520" style="s2">excitotoxins the way that it brings</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.900" end="00:52:54.470" style="s2">excessive glutamate outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.520" end="00:52:58.849" style="s2">synapse so it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.470" end="00:53:01.400" style="s2">molecule a new pepsin quality as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.849" end="00:53:05.329" style="s2">great now there are plenty of things</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.400" end="00:53:08.470" style="s2">that we would have in qualia if there</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.329" end="00:53:10.700" style="s2">was different regulatory dynamics okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.470" end="00:53:14.510" style="s2">but you know so we&#39;re working within</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.700" end="00:53:17.660" style="s2">both the general well-tolerated space</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.510" end="00:53:22.279" style="s2">the effective space the and the legal</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.660" end="00:53:23.750" style="s2">space sure yeah people micro dosing LSD</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.279" end="00:53:24.260" style="s2">or psilocybin has a lot of neat effects</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.750" end="00:53:27.830" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.260" end="00:53:31.460" style="s2">that&#39;s that arising right um not yet not</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.830" end="00:53:33.460" style="s2">yet so actually that&#39;s face of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.460" end="00:53:35.630" style="s2">appropriate legal categorization of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.460" end="00:53:37.490" style="s2">medicines as its base that we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.630" end="00:53:39.380" style="s2">worked in and intend to more because</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.490" end="00:53:42.950" style="s2">it&#39;s important so more political legal</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.380" end="00:53:47.330" style="s2">and regulatory not at the physiology but</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.950" end="00:53:50.750" style="s2">at the body politic exactly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.330" end="00:53:53.330" style="s2">so when you look at say two men offend</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.750" end="00:53:55.400" style="s2">being over-the-counter hmm as a legacy</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.330" end="00:53:59.900" style="s2">thing in the toxicity of it came to hair</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.400" end="00:54:01.220" style="s2">to pot having been illegal for and still</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.900" end="00:54:03.890" style="s2">illegal and so many plays for so long</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.220" end="00:54:05.150" style="s2">it&#39;s just nonsense right right and we</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.890" end="00:54:07.430" style="s2">can look at the whole history of why</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.150" end="00:54:08.840" style="s2">those nonsense decisions were made but</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.430" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">they&#39;re not just nonsense they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.840" end="00:54:12.620" style="s2">bad for people</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:14.360" style="s2">yeah because pot doesn&#39;t cause liver</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.620" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">damage and acetaminophen does and it but</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.360" end="00:54:17.390" style="s2">it addresses the same pain dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:19.670" style="s2">people using it man</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.390" end="00:54:21.740" style="s2">yeah but you can put a few minutes on it</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.670" end="00:54:22.940" style="s2">with opiates and that prevents people</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.740" end="00:54:25.310" style="s2">from taking all the opiates and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.940" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">overdosing in theory that&#39;s that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.310" end="00:54:29.690" style="s2">course the title three vicodin kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:31.760" style="s2">approach is to combine to seem innocent</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.690" end="00:54:32.900" style="s2">to avoid to to say hey it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.760" end="00:54:35.450" style="s2">kill you if you take too much don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.900" end="00:54:38.570" style="s2">too much and so then people take too</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.450" end="00:54:40.610" style="s2">much and get liver damage right right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.570" end="00:54:41.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not a good idea but maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.610" end="00:54:46.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t that wasn&#39;t well thought out</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.810" end="00:54:48.290" style="s2">right so um it&#39;s been heady stuff Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.730" end="00:54:49.880" style="s2">thank you so much for sharing a video</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.290" end="00:54:51.500" style="s2">wisdom where can people find out more</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.880" end="00:54:54.410" style="s2">about you other projects do you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.500" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">going on how can they dig into the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.410" end="00:54:57.560" style="s2">the Daniel list that that we have here</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:00.110" style="s2">in front of us a little more if they</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.560" end="00:55:01.820" style="s2">have had their interest sparked as far</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.110" end="00:55:04.040" style="s2">as the topics were talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.820" end="00:55:05.660" style="s2">neural high kinetics neural hacker calm</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.040" end="00:55:08.120" style="s2">okay a good place to go check it out</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.660" end="00:55:11.030" style="s2">great publishing more information there</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.120" end="00:55:12.890" style="s2">and I want to say that the work that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.030" end="00:55:14.870" style="s2">are doing and neurofeedback and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.890" end="00:55:16.670" style="s2">that you&#39;re scaling it with quality</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.870" end="00:55:19.190" style="s2">control and with the systems that allow</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.670" end="00:55:20.570" style="s2">that to happen that&#39;s one of the areas</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.190" end="00:55:21.860" style="s2">that if you hadn&#39;t done it we would have</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.570" end="00:55:24.320" style="s2">eventually got into because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.860" end="00:55:26.750" style="s2">critical and we think it is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.320" end="00:55:30.170" style="s2">really most meaningful neuro hacks that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.750" end="00:55:32.810" style="s2">has the least the least damage box</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.170" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">really small downside is if done well</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.810" end="00:55:38.090" style="s2">right yeah yeah it&#39;s real super high</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.880" end="00:55:39.470" style="s2">reward possibility so I&#39;m excited too</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.090" end="00:55:40.940" style="s2">look at if there&#39;s a way we can partner</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.470" end="00:55:42.200" style="s2">and support what you&#39;re doing I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.940" end="00:55:43.670" style="s2">there is we&#39;re both in Southern</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.200" end="00:55:46.370" style="s2">California so we should very at least</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.670" end="00:55:47.690" style="s2">try to work that great so can they fall</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.370" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">can folks while you on Twitter Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.690" end="00:55:52.340" style="s2">LinkedIn what&#39;s the what&#39;s if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:53.390" style="s2">one of you know follow you and here so</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.340" end="00:55:54.740" style="s2">you drop wisdom and see all the things</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.390" end="00:55:56.570" style="s2">you do what&#39;s the best way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.740" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">Facebook is probably best Facebook all</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.570" end="00:55:59.390" style="s2">right great</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">so today&#39;s guest has been Daniel</p>

<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:06.830" style="s2">collective we packed more into this hour</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.950" end="00:56:07.820" style="s2">than I think most shows we&#39;ve had I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.830" end="00:56:10.430" style="s2">going to go back and listen to myself</p>

<p begin="00:56:10.430" end="00:56:14.420" style="s2">so I rarely have to stretch myself that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.650" end="00:56:16.610" style="s2">way I really appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.420" end="00:56:18.770" style="s2">so folks it has been another show of</p>
