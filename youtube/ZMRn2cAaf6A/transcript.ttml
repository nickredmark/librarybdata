<p begin="00:00:15.679" end="00:00:19.359" style="s2">agree on everything but</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.439" end="00:00:32.719" style="s2">very short reintroduction of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.039" end="00:00:34.000" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll introduce the topic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.719" end="00:00:37.280" style="s2">going to start with</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.000" end="00:00:40.000" style="s2">yeah thanks for having me back i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.280" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">political sociologist uh a rogue one at</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.000" end="00:00:44.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:46.480" style="s2">and um uh very engaged</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.239" end="00:00:48.800" style="s2">in the uh in the literal and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.480" end="00:00:52.160" style="s2">sociological sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.800" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">and um kind of uh in limbo</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.160" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">right now for various reasons but um</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:58.480" style="s2">all the more reason to engage on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.480" end="00:01:04.159" style="s2">subject um which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">metanoia as you&#39;re gonna give your</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.159" end="00:01:08.560" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">so um brett i&#39;m gonna talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.560" end="00:01:12.320" style="s2">how i have used the word</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">in my work and what it and how i</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:15.920" style="s2">understand it and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">that will hopefully give something as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.920" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">foil for you to enter into discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:21.920" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">uh so um you know the term for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.920" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">is gone out of uh sort of the of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">for me a christian or origin it comes</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">from the new testament</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:32.079" style="s2">uh the metanoia it&#39;s often translated as</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">conversion</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.079" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a very poor translation especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">you know in 2020 in which the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:39.759" style="s2">conversion</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">has gone through sort of american</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.759" end="00:01:43.119" style="s2">protestantism and met this particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.119" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">you know emotional experience um</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">but if you go back to the original</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">meaning of the word and especially to</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:54.399" style="s2">its neoplatonic heritage</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:55.119" style="s2">meta of course means beyond uh to get to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.399" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.119" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">uh of sort of the the structuring</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">principles of something</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">like metaphysics you&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">about physics you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">structuring</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">principles of physics and then neue is</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">of course from the greek</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">nueces uh and you&#39;re probably aware of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve made arguments that noises</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">correspond to what i call perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">um and uh and so what what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:20.319" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">is a kind of transformation in which the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.319" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">that structure your perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">what you find salient and relevant</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:30.400" style="s2">have been deeply tra and permanently at</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">least long-standingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">transformed and that&#39;s why the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">of turning</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">because what happens when i turn is i</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">have this perspective in which these</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">things are relevant and salient</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">and then i turn this way and the now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">in another perspective when things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">relevant and salient</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">and then the idea is that&#39;s a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">something analogous that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">can happen to people uh when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">undergoing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">a transformation and these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">transformation have historically been</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">i think have something to do with wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">on one hand or have something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">and that this term is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">very contested and very vague uh but</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">spirituality in another</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">and so i i we sort of ended last night</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">and we were sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">bridging the topic of um the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:16.959" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">of of what you&#39;ve been talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.959" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">then you propose metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:23.440" style="s2">as a bridging point between if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">allow me this from the sociological</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.440" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">and the spiritual practice and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">how i&#39;m seeing it and that&#39;s why now now</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">i&#39;d like to hear</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">what you want to say about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">that&#39;s a great setup um i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">issue a quick</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">correction if if if i&#39;m right i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">the the more true definition of the term</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">is conversion whereas it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">translated in the bible as repentance</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">yeah at times at times yeah and so so</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:55.439" style="s2">the the research</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:56.680" style="s2">that i&#39;ve that have aggregated basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.439" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">says that the bible</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.680" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">mistranslated translates it as</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">repentance which</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">i it&#39;s not completely wrong and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">repentance and guilt and all that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">very useful in this concept but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:10.159" style="s2">describes</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">metanoia more broadly as conversion um</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.159" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">the ways the ways you did describe it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">that&#39;s an important framing in the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">like that it&#39;s that uh this you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">that comes through the christian</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.759" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">um sort of manifest in repentance but</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">the deeper meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">is conversion and the that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:31.199" style="s2">scholarship suggests is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">deeper meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.199" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">yeah and i&#39;ve not found any uh sources</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">for metanoia exactly outside of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">outside of greek and outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:43.199" style="s2">bible it&#39;s that it all points back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.199" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">but i wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">exclusive to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">either you know oh no we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">always when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">historicize too and when we try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">a contemporary metaphysics we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">to uh disambiguate and abstract the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:02.720" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">from these historical meanings uh but</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.720" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">then also contextualize in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">in our current moment our current</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">unfolding of history</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">and so um you know then the nesting in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">is is important but i don&#39;t want anyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:18.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">to think that it&#39;s exclusive to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.160" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">especially because</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">christianity has been so hegemonic and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:29.320" style="s2">the christian religion you know um</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">it emerged but it also was</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.320" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">institutionalized</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">by different powers that be over time</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">much of it after the fact like much of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">this historical writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">of of um the of the time of jesus and of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:43.440" style="s2">ancient greece even</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">of alexander the great much of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.440" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">writing that has survived</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">was hundreds of years after the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">there&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">tangible history but we but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">taken as such</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:06:01.199" style="s2">uh typically until it&#39;s deconstructed</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">and so um you know i&#39;ve gravitated</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.199" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">towards this term for</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">for a long time uh especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">you know um about eight years ago 2012</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">uh my my research in metamodernism was</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:17.039" style="s2">really around this meta prefix and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.039" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">whatever i fell into that bucket right</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">um um</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">uh metaphysics and metanoia especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">was something that i thought was</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">under under uh explored and analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">and internet modernism you mean you was</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">being underexplored</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">within just in general just in general i</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">mean even at that time meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">hardly existed as a as a discourse right</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:45.280" style="s2">but but so so i went through my own kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">spiritual conversions and um</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">you know in in the uh the paper that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve been writing</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">you know i cite on one hand there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">authors that say metanoia is very rare</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">it only happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">once twice maybe three times in your</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">life and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:05.520" style="s2">certainly in in in a grand sense it</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">would be that rare</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.520" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">but then there&#39;s another example i give</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">of a ted speaker</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">who says oh you have you know tens of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">thousands a hundred thousand metanoias</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">in your life because they&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">the other end of the spectrum just</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">little novel changes</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">and so um you know we gotta we gotta</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">play with that spectrum but i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:28.720" style="s2">leaning towards the more</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">substantive changes but i i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.720" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">prefacing that because i&#39;ve also had</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">lots of little changes in my life</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">so right so when i say conversion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">not that i converted to christianity or</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">from christianity</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">for example i grew up secular and uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">you know interested in you know secular</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:48.319" style="s2">humanism</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">as a kind of contemporary scientific</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.319" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">civil religion uh if you&#39;re part of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">tradition at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">and you know and so you know you talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">about the religion without a religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">and all that but like all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">preceded by</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">pluralism and a kind of study of world</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">yeah and uh so there&#39;s a revive revived</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">interest in</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">uh in religion and mythology but</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">it&#39;s all and as far as i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">it&#39;s all a dead end unless you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">to weave those threads together</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">into into a uh you know try to parade</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">them into a meta narrative and so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">world religions are all part of a common</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:25.919" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">of humans discovering and creating</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.919" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">and so so i i have my own sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">metanoias</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">within the christian tradition but then</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">also beyond that and political social</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">economic personal metanoias</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">and the the research i did has taken me</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">across all these fields</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">such that the the term has been um</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">by people like peter senge has been</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">introduced into business</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">right and so um but there&#39;s still a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">of work to be done</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">to again to weave those threads back</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">because they&#39;re all inconclusive</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">essentially so there&#39;s a couple things i</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">want to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">um so there was three things he said the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">first was you know that uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">i think uh there&#39;s a vacancy point i</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">think that metanoia sits within a family</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">uh family resemblance idea of related</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">things so whereas you may not have</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">you know i mean you may not have a term</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">like it etymologically or syntactically</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">i think buddhist notions of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">enlightenment i think enlightenment is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">also that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">deeply transformed transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:35.920" style="s2">one&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">noticing and what one finds deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.920" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">salient and relevant</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">and so i think that&#39;s and i think if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">i think if we broaden the scope to think</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">of that uh you know the family</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">resemblance class</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">um awakening is another one awakening is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">like you you&#39;re in this and you go to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">that right um</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">and so i i agree with you i think if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">open up and look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">rather than trying to find a strict</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">if we collect this family resemblance</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">together then i think we can start to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about i think we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">abduce what is perhaps general or</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">universal</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">uh but also also specify what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">historically and culturally specific</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">and i think we can do both of those so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">on the second point</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">the idea of the spectrum uh i i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">know if you know this the work i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">with dana greg</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">i argue explicitly for that and andrew</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">newberg has done</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">um that as well um in his book um</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">uh so how enlightenment affects your</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">brain this is the idea that there being</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">uh between the machinery of insight into</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">things like the flow experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">and mystical experiences which i do</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">experimental work on and then full-blown</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">awakening experiences in which people</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">not just have a mystical experience but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">they feel called to transform themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">in response to that and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuum there</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">and i i think remembering the continuum</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">is very important because</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">we just talked about this and over here</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">people will spa right but if you make</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">them realize deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">the continuum then its relevancy and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:10.480" style="s2">currency to them</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">is more much more apparent much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.480" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">apparent</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">and then the third thing is more of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">maybe a question</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.519" style="s2">um uh so you&#39;ve sort of brought out two</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">aspects of something</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.519" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">and very often people put them in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">in a relationship of debate i&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">this within</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">uh cognitive science and philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me two terms</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">you won&#39;t mention one already pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">but the one that is often opposed to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">is perennialism uh the idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">is they&#39;re all saying that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">now i would i think you do too i reject</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">i think there&#39;s something right about</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">pluralism but there&#39;s also the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">that that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">universal things because</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">i think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">distinguishes pluralism from mere</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">relativism</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">which gets incommensurability and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">kinds of you know self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">is that pluralism says that while there</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">is considerable variation like we just</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">there are nevertheless universal</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">processes in terms of which we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">understand and compare and bring these</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">things into dialogue where do you stand</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">on that perennialism yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:22.720" style="s2">yeah i appreciate that that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">question i i don&#39;t think i</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.720" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">would reject perennialism um i</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">i think they i think they can it can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">compatible with</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">let&#39;s say pluralism right we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">can juxtapose them without canceling</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">each other out um it&#39;s a good word i</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.519" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">should have</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">invoked it before um because it is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">there&#39;s many ideas within perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">uh but just the you know it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">subject but just the idea itself</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">i i like the kind of universal religion</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">because religions are</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">so um historically and materially</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">you know predicated and and constituted</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">and we often forget that like all that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:03.880" style="s2">survives is the myths right and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">forget about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.880" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">geography and all these essential things</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">of course as i alluded to in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">beginning like we can&#39;t forget how much</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">of history has been lost or destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">you know like just ballpark 99</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">of like documents of the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">is gone</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.680" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">but um before going further i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">give a plug to this book</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">um uh from i think from 2018</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:33.200" style="s2">um by bloomsbury it&#39;s called metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">a speculative ontology of language</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.200" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">thinking in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">oh and that was it&#39;s referenced it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">referenced briefly in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">draft that i sent you but um you know um</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s probably i don&#39;t actually draw</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">on it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s probably the the best book on</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">the subject and the most</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:54.000" style="s2">coincidentally the closest to your</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">research interests</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.000" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a ton of good stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">there so if we if we do converse on that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">more we could use this a book like this</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">as a jumping off point</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">but but because i came across yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">because i came across so many sources in</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">my research</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">and many that this book didn&#39;t reference</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">i thought i wanted to go broader right</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">because this this book is</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">is fantastic starting point um</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">but but it it says nothing about what</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">in terms of a paradigm shift right how</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">do we achieve mass</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">you know class consciousness and tipping</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">points and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">all the sorts of fantastical</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">ideas of modernism right uh but they</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">definitely dovetail</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s um sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">um alignment with um you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">speculative realism and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">and object-oriented ontology and all on</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">all that so</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">there&#39;s so much in here just in you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">they talk about poesis and um</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">you know a lucia and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">at some point there&#39;s some quotes there</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">about like the metanoia is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">fundamental concept to philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">right okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">i think that i thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">recommending that i&#39;m sorry i have not</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">come across that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome yeah yeah i i i i will</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">definitely order that book once</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">once we&#39;re done talking okay so i want</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">to give you space and like you</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">you&#39;ll probably say things that i might</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">not initially agree with</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">uh but but before i do that um before we</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">move to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">like because i want i like</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve made a criticism of me and i take</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">and i tried to take it to heart</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">um and you said you know because i talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">and you don&#39;t you don&#39;t dismiss this you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">recognize it i talk a lot about bridging</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:41.680" style="s2">between science and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">but you say you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.680" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">appropriately yeah but what about</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">science and the political i have some</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">uh of of that but i think you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">more aristotelian sense of politics</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">than the current meaning of that term</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s part of the we could work</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">out the semantics but the discussions</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">with layman and zach have sort of opened</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.839" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">me up</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">uh to at least what zach and layman have</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">been calling the meta-political</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">and so maybe you and i can initially i</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">mean at least maybe the two metas are</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">some common ground</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">the metanoia and the meta-political uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">but i will give you space for what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">want to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:15.839" style="s2">but before i do that i wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">about the perennialism because</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.839" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">a thing going on in perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:23.759" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of there&#39;s two versions of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">it there&#39;s like sort of a ken wilber</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.759" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">right and then there&#39;s uh a jorge</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">ferreira version</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">and ferreira&#39;s version is that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">perennialism is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">not one uh that everybody says has the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">but that instead it&#39;s much more what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">would even call sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">procedural perennialism the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">uh there is a kind of knowing what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">call participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">that all of the religions are crafting</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">procedures</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">to try and get us to remember the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">perspective of the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:55.759" style="s2">and that that kind of perennialism i</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">think is viable</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.759" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">in concert with uh something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">whereas i find the perennialism of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">huxley for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">uh i find that very hard uh because</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">his seems well to use one of your terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">it seems very hegemonic</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:13.679" style="s2">it seems like that all of these are</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">basically you know this particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.679" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">sort of christianized view of hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">that he had</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">and so i&#39;m very sort of i&#39;m sort of wary</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">would you say that you&#39;re more of on</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">that side of perennialism the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">the ferrer side than the huxley side it</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:30.840" style="s2">just so</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">do i understand where you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.840" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">did you swap out um wilbur for huxley</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">well i i i i see i see wilbur</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">as a as a modern version of huxley okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">okay yeah i mean are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:51.200" style="s2">all this huxley</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:51.200" style="s2">yeah yes i mean i i love all this huxley</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a good place to start but however</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">i think i think i&#39;d lean more the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">way as</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and what you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">you know evokes in me the the sociology</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">of religion so</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">within that subject right that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">merging of fields</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">they understand all of that stuff from a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">functional point of view like what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">religion actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">as a form of social organization and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">and so i guess on the other hand you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">saying that um</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">the the wilbur huxley version is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">uh a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">abstracting it into a western context</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">a bit wishy-washy new age or prone for</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">misinterpretation</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think i mean so for me i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">find it</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">as easily alignable with sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">best cognitive science that i know</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">probably cognition wait culture and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">what i call cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">works um</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">like so while i think you know and evan</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">thompson has made a very similar</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">argument in his recent book you know why</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">i&#39;m not a buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:03.360" style="s2">you know he he argues that um</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">western buddhism has basically sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">crafted itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">uh to look like it&#39;s very scientific and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">then claim that all of buddhism has</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">always been</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">more scientific uh and and and i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">so he rightly criticizes what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">buddhist exceptionalism</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">the idea that somehow buddhism you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:22.799" style="s2">and i and i&#39;m a friend of buddhism you</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">know that right but this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.799" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">hostile skeptic from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">the same thing would happen right i know</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">evan personally and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">that kind of exceptionalism what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">saying is there is a version i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">saying all versions</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">saying there&#39;s a version or a branch</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">maybe i&#39;m doing something similar</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">like what you did with the modernism but</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a branch of perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">that sort of allies itself with various</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">kinds of exceptionalisms</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">and that strikes me as i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">you can make any kind of good</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">um justification for that move that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">what i&#39;m criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">i think i understand um</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:03.679" style="s2">sorry i got distracted because i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">trying to look up a world religions tree</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">yeah um and this is something i i came</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">a a long a long time ago but it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">it came out of a a research project and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">a foundation that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">i think dovetails with what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">talking about in you know trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">you know first of all map everything but</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">uh from that sort of macro perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">you can you can trace the origins and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">in in the tree</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">you know all the world religions do go</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">to uh not a single source</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">right but a kind of a kind of um a kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">weave a kind of trunk you know a threat</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">of sources and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s the same with languages right</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">and i&#39;m fascinated with that idea too</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">because again we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">pre-history</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">you know before written history kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">existed and it like it just</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">it was just extant it didn&#39;t exist in</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">the abstract it just was</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">you know i&#39;m sure people had thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">and stuff but they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">writing they didn&#39;t have um institutions</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">they just they had language and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">that&#39;s mind-blowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.880" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">in itself and so you know with</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">metamodernism we&#39;re trying to trace this</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">long arc of history</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">uh and and you know not throw the baby</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">out with the bathwater</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">because all the all of these traditions</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">still have something to teach</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">i your language your language example</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">though is is really pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">so what i&#39;m proposing is something not</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:42.799" style="s2">not like that there is one</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">you know there&#39;s one best language let</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.799" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">let let&#39;s use the chomsky framework</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">i i i have criticisms of some of trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">linguistics so</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">let&#39;s put it aside because right right</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">the idea of universal grammar that all</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">languages make use of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">uh universal grammar but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">mean that all languages have the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">actual grammar and they work very</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">differently because they fit their</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">historical context</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">and you shouldn&#39;t use the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">universal grammar</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">to try and say somehow german</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">is a better language than spanish or</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.559" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">something like that and i hear people do</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">all the time they make exceptionalism</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">arguments like blah blah is a way more</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">complex language than blah blah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">and one of my criticism of heidegger by</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">the way is the way he get he he has that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">exceptionalism towards german as the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">best language in which one does</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">or something like that and that for me</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">is like no that that&#39;s very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i&#39;m criticizing i i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a universal</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">that you&#39;ll allow me the metaphor don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">don&#39;t push me too hard on it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a universal grammar for</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">religion but i think there are many</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">different religious languages</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">and the universal grammar is does not</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">give the basis</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">for privilege in any one of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">languages over the other that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">yeah exactly and um so</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">so with that said like i want to go in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">two directions</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">either simultaneously or or</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">you know one at a time but one is we</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">keep going in this broad</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:12.799" style="s2">abstract direction but the other is you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">know i wanted to touch on</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.799" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">christian metanoia because we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">about that within the bubble</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">yeah yes christianity right and so then</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">it&#39;s contextualized in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">that greater context um okay so if i</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">if i go there first um so my the point i</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">wanted to make though is like</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:33.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve always been uh a dabbler in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:35.280" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">religions and fields right and i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.280" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">not i&#39;m not just co-opting to mash up</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">something i&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">each one has its own complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">depth yep</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">but i do think that at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:49.360" style="s2">day they&#39;re kind of they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.559" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">dead ends like or cul-de-sacs rather you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.360" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">know you got it you got to return to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">source</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">and um you know so so there&#39;s a within</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:23:59.440" style="s2">christianity there&#39;s many traditions</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">right now i&#39;ve gravitated towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.440" end="00:24:03.520" style="s2">certain traditions more like gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">christianity right</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">so and and my take away from that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">you know god is kind of within and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">you know i i don&#39;t mean in a crude sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">that you you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">uh direct gnostic access but in</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">a cognitive sense you&#39;re you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.159" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">you study and you enter the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">maybe you take some substances</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">uh and you have a gnostic experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">right which is your mind is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">is lit up and it&#39;s integrating and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">synthesizing all this information</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">right and so this is contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">language but</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">my understanding of the the jesus</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">itself in in that time</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">and before i say this i want to preface</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">like jesus may not have existed</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">historically like there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">serious scholarly arguments</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">uh that that um you know that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:25:02.320" style="s2">deconstruct that notion and so i want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">give a kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.320" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">just an honest take because</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">somebody like jordan peterson for</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">example waffles on this topic and thinks</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">maybe even jesus came back from the dead</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">and so i want to i want to draw a clear</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">line right and so i&#39;m not disrespecting</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">i&#39;m taking it to a higher level than</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">someone like jordan peterson you need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">historicize it</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">not that&#39;s my cat</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">um so so jesus may have existed</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:34.799" style="s2">uh there may i wrote a paper once that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">uh i</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.799" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">found there was many people named jesus</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">at that time and many</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">you know crucifixion was a a common</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">so since there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s uh still</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">written about jesus at the time you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">nothing gives us any</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">real context you know eyewitness</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">accounts what is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">worth i&#39;m just i want to start off on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">a clear speculative ground here right</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:03.279" style="s2">and i&#39;m also going to preface and say</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not going to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">jesus was a socialist or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">because these are anachronistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">terms in that sense however</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">that is kind of what i&#39;m saying is like</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">jesus was a rebel</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">a political rebel of his time</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:22.640" style="s2">um and he was he was basically</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">persecuted and crucified for</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.640" end="00:26:26.320" style="s2">um not just political crimes but</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:28.720" style="s2">spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.320" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">blasphemy saying i am god and all this</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.720" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">right so the punchline that i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">to is that the metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">of jesus and of all of christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">to realize the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:41.559" style="s2">divine spark within everybody</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">and that and so you&#39;re taking away that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.559" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">monotheistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">authority from the state and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">bringing it into yourself right so jesus</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">as a jew</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">under roman rule is saying no uh excuse</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">i&#39;m god you can&#39;t tell me otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">and so i really respect that that notion</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">if christianity is about anything</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">fundamentally it hangs on that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">and so this is why i i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">fetishize the character of jesus at all</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:13.440" style="s2">this we&#39;re talking about 2000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s got nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">with with you know the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:21.919" style="s2">um you know modernity so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">you know again not throw the baby with</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.919" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">the bath water</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">but um recontextualize all these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">re-learn</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:32.399" style="s2">and be it be it stop talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">religion stop talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.399" end="00:27:35.679" style="s2">or that figurehead but embody it and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">my own realizations have been along</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">those lines is</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:42.640" style="s2">is not that i&#39;m the messiah right there</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:44.399" style="s2">is no messiah</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.640" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">but then i&#39;m going to try to live up to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.399" end="00:27:47.440" style="s2">those principles and not the principles</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">as you know um sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">distilled by this or that church which</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">which can very easily be co-opted into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">a political agenda or whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">or just as a mechanism of social control</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">but as this so to bring back this term</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">perennial is this perennial realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">yeah that divinity is within us all and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">that we have to nurture that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">and practice it practice it through</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">and and if we&#39;re gonna have religion</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">uh and we&#39;re if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.559" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">institutionalize it then it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">far far you know more ethical than what</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">historically it needs to be totally</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">non-violent uh totally humanist</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">and this is what people like martin</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">luther king and gandhi</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">embodied and pursued with the same vigor</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">as a kind of christ figure</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s wonderful so just uh you</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">recommended a book to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:48.640" style="s2">did you have you read april the conic&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">book uh the gnostic new age</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.640" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">uh because basically she&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">people there so the gnostics have</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:56.440" style="s2">undergone um you probably are aware of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">this they&#39;ve undergone a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.440" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">significant uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">revival and revisioning within</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">scholastic work</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">i mean so i mean not that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">good book hundred donuts book</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">is i think a very important book but</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">since then there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">a reinterpretation and some people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">even questioning whether there was ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">something like the gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">uh people argue that narcissism was and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">there&#39;s good evidence amounting to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.919" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">narcissism is much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">a style of any religion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">practicing um they the comparison</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">that&#39;s often made is like narcissism is</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">a term like</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the same term it&#39;s i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">talking about what kind of term it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the same kind of term as</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">you can be a fundamentalist christian uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">fundamentalist muslim</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">cetera and narcissism is much more like</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:44.320" style="s2">that i don&#39;t know if you know there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">episode in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.320" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">uh series that i did on on gnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">narcissism and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">done some talk on this but anyways one</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">the brought out and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">this is the way i i argued it i want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">know what you think about this because i</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">argue</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">that the gnostics and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">problems with the gnostics they also</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">have a dark history</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">they go into the you know the european</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">underground and get associated</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">with all kinds of conspiracy theory crap</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s been danger there</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">in their history but going back to what</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">you said</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">the the perennial quest i argued that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which the gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">are trying to complete the actual</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">because what the chronic argues is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">uh the exo revolution had already</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">done a significant change but</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">what she says is you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">transgressive nature</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">of gnosticism was that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">it was calling into question something</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">that had been held over</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.919" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">from the pre-axial period into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">actual period</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">which was that the basic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">between human beings and the god</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">was one modeled on enslavement and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:55.679" style="s2">servitude</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">and that the gnostics were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.679" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">finish the axial revolution by</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">removing that and therefore seeing all</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">the existing gods</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">as uh representing that holdover</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">uh that that and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">and so you know and and this comes out</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">this comes out in places where people</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">might not expect</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">so here&#39;s you know he&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">considered</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:23.039" style="s2">you know uh radical in some sense but</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">he&#39;s nevertheless considered a mainline</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.039" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">an important theologian</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">paul tillich when paul talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">god beyond the god of theism</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">he&#39;s basically making that same argument</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">he&#39;s making the argument</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t completed the actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:37.279" style="s2">revolution if that&#39;s something we want</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.279" end="00:31:41.840" style="s2">but but nevertheless right because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">still bound to this grammar</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.840" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">of sacredness and slavery being bound</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">and of course i think that does have all</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">kinds of metapolitical consequences</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">in it and so and yeah and you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">jesus is crucified</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">and crucifixion is the punishment uh for</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">you know political threats to the roman</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">establishment let&#39;s not let&#39;s not forget</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">he i agree with you he&#39;s also criticized</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">he&#39;s also crucified</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">for religious reasons uh having to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.519" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">again here&#39;s a gnostic thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">he seems to be overthrowing purity codes</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">um and this was also part of the gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">thing that the purity codes that we live</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:20.320" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">are often ways in which we are bound</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.320" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">into things</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">you know you get this in jesus saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">things like you know the sabbath was</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">made for mankind</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">not mankind for the sabbath he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">to invert the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">um in a very fundamental way and so i</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:36.799" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">i i i i wanna this sorry this is long</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.799" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">i i&#39;m sort of getting you though i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">sort of getting why</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">that and this is honest and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">it&#39;s respectful</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">and getting why you would be attracted</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:49.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.039" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">sort of the gnostic thread uh within</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.120" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">yeah and let me yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">lot i want to pick up off there</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">and keep going um so yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">with you i&#39;m not going to refute</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">anything about the the history of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">gnosticism like there&#39;s many rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">holes there and what i&#39;m attracted to is</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">is the knowledge part right the knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">as a you know a sociology person</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">um this is where it gets tangible and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">interesting is like you know religion</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">and not just religion but</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">uh you know social organization in</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">general but</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">but religion in particular tries to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">control knowledge and power</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">right that relationship yes it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">been that way and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">to this day we have an epistemic crisis</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">where we</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">can&#39;t disentangle knowledge and power</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">you know so it undermines scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">because so much of uh scholarship and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">scholasticism was created under these</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">conditions of power</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:53.440" style="s2">and so history is the unfolding of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">and i do believe in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.440" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">abstract sense of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">um uh well let&#39;s say completing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">axial age</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">but also you know fulfilling you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">hegel and marx&#39;s vision like so</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an eschatology here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">and not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:13.839" style="s2">like like uh like a nihilistic one right</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">like this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">it&#39;s rel we can strive for relative</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">utopia</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">but um you know so i reject the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">biblical eschatology but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">fascinating because</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">there was a a great flood in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">history right before writing</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">again and this was passed down through</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">through uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">yeah old tradition and all that i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:40.480" style="s2">there&#39;s good callers around that i agree</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">yeah but we we we couldn&#39;t confirm it</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.480" end="00:34:43.919" style="s2">until later science</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">right and then we you know and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.919" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">like we&#39;re finding noah&#39;s ark or</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">whatever like</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">yeah whatever but but there was a great</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">flood and sea levels rose like 400</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">feet whatever it was and um</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">uh you know and so it was for</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">you know humanity or whatever uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">collective consciousness existed</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">um in its in its primitive forms um</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">there was culture and there was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">of social imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">and that was destroyed and of course in</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">a smaller scale there&#39;s been many many</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">end times right this is a ubiquitous uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:21.839" style="s2">recurrent</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">concept but what is different today</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.839" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">right and again putting aside like mine</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">calendar prophecies and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">putting you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">we we are in the kind of end times and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.040" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">so i like this theme</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:36.880" style="s2">uh because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s ubiquitous in</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">in in culture and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">and and with with climate change with</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">the end of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">uh these things are kind of kicking the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">door</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">down and you know these things are like</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">confronting us and we have to confront</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:52.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">um so so my my broader point though is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.240" end="00:35:55.119" style="s2">that everything you said and what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">trying to say dovetails into this</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.119" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">political conversation was inescapable</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">because it defines the terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:03.119" style="s2">knowledge and power</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">and how they relate so um you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.119" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">20th century</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">saw a lot of brutality but it also saw</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">the expansion</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">of these progressive humanist</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:16.079" style="s2">institutions but they&#39;re still not</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">universal we&#39;re still debating things</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.079" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">systemic racism like the extent of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:24.960" style="s2">there&#39;s people who deny it uh and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">you know white supremacy is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">is a latent invisible thing um</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:33.440" style="s2">that acts through people uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">sometimes unconsciously through and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">through institutions</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">and so this kind of stuff this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">lower level stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">actually prevents us from solving the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">greater problem right and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">solve</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">all the problems in an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">fashion is that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">yeah yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">so um yeah coming back to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">gnosis like</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">like i think for myself and probably a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">who study and practice these things you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">eventually you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">responsibility for it yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">figure it out yourself right so um</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:13.119" style="s2">so i guess for me it&#39;s been a quest of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">of extracting</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.119" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">uh knowledge from</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">uh from a given context like</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">trying trying to learn things firsthand</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">as impossible as that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">you know like when it comes to politics</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">you need to decode a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">nonsense and so uh and you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">kind of spiritually grounded at the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">time so you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">um i guess differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">uh different qualities of information</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">can i can i can</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">can i pick up on that in one concrete</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:49.760" style="s2">example from my own work</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">because when you&#39;re invoking the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.760" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">eschaton and the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">i mean so chris and philip and i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.280" end="00:37:55.599" style="s2">in the book you know about the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.599" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">and the problem about the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">apocalypse is right is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:02.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a perversion of of apocalypse right</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">apocalypse originally meant revelation</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">it meant something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">a worldwide insight a metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">on at a civilization level uh so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">and the asian arena relationship to use</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">my language or our language</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">i mean my co-authors is radically</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">transformed</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">and a viable long-term future</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">is now made possible in a way it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">before the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">myth is you have decadence and it can</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">the only future is a decadent one and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">then you get this metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">that&#39;s systemic across the civilization</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">a viable future becomes available but</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">the point about the zombie apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">is it articulate it expresses without</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">articulation so</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">i misspoke it expresses without</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">articulation the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">and how it&#39;s infecting our notion and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">basically shutting it down</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">because what the zombie apocalypse is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the perversion the zombie is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">perversion of the resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">the zombie apocalypse is not a viable</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">future it&#39;s a future</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">that is continually decaying everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">is being every</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">and so what i&#39;m what what i&#39;m saying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">you is</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">like you mentioned that decoding</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.599" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">and it and maybe this won&#39;t be how you</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">would use your work with this word but i</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">would use this word</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">here and what i&#39;m learning from zach and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:27.359" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">layman i think there&#39;s a meta-political</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.359" end="00:39:32.320" style="s2">project of decoding</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">that perversion of the myth and showing</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">that you know that it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">it&#39;s very attractive that goes without</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:41.680" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s attractive in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.680" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">entrapping and it&#39;s preventing</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">right it&#39;s preventing the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">we need in order to try and bring about</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">a viable future now is that an example</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">of the kind of thing we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">where like we&#39;re we&#39;re like i was trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">to get it go go people</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">we were trying to get people to see this</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">myth</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">because i don&#39;t believe in mythology yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">you believe in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">you believe in this and you enact it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">you will do these huge</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">social rituals going on zombie walks and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:16.079" style="s2">dressing up like zombies yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.599" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">right but you&#39;re not you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">your verb again you&#39;re not decoding this</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">you&#39;re not seeing what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">articulated in here</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">and you&#39;re not and and worse you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">what&#39;s being perpetuated yeah in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">mythos</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">and how it&#39;s hamstringing you in a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">very powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">so i have this ambivalent attitude</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">towards the zombie apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">i mean i think it&#39;s important as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">phenomenon but i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">people need to decode it and understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">yeah what it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">is that is that a fair example i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:47.839" style="s2">trying to yeah it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">work it&#39;s a great example because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.839" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">thought about</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">the zombie apocalypse a fair bit i</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:53.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t written about it yet but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.520" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">let me see if i can just explain my</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">thoughts because</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">because uh yeah zombie culture is big</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not a big [ __ ] buff</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s lots out there but i</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">like i like i like meta humor so for</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">example you take the movie shawn of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s very popular kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">play on zombie films right</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:16.079" style="s2">and so i love that kind of stuff but so</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:17.760" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">you know the so the the the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.760" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">depiction of zombies is like the living</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">and they eat brains and all this and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s ironic because what i see is</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:27.280" style="s2">zombie culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:29.200" style="s2">and i have no doubt there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.280" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">written on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">but zombie culture is like consumerism</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">so you&#39;re so kind of mindless</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">just droning around and you know um</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">and the idea of eating brains is ironic</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s like this longing for</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">knowledge but you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">work you want to take the shortcut and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">just nourish yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">cannibalizing somebody else right so a</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">lot of these sort of myths wherever they</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">originate from they do kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">layer and complicate some simpler truth</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">like in the case of zombies it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">you know it&#39;s maybe a a death denial</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">mechanism and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">it it sub serves functions and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.599" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">sublimates all these things and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">entertains us but if we&#39;re to decode it</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">i would say the zombie apocalypse would</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:17.760" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">you know just people who are</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.760" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">sort of uncritically uh drifting through</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">yeah even if they&#39;re very smart you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">if they&#39;re just mindless consumers</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">that the zombie apocalypse is awakening</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">right and and breaking the mold that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">you&#39;re in and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">and um issuing those habits</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.560" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">right and and eschewing the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">literalism of the myth</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:42.079" style="s2">yes right always looking at the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.079" end="00:42:46.800" style="s2">yeah and and it seems like you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">coming back to mass metanoia it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.800" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">it seems like we&#39;re not getting any</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">closer you know like there&#39;s things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">the zeitgeist movement and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">other things like that which are trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:42:57.920" style="s2">to build mass consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:42:59.280" style="s2">and a kind of political cultural</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.920" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">meta-narrative uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:05.280" style="s2">which in large part is perennial it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like the interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.280" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">the zeitgeist movement is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">you know consciously kind of theatrical</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">and vaudevillian and</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">yeah and it and it and it merged all</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">these religions and said look well the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">the myths of jesus is just like horus or</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">you know so it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">meta-historical um</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">but ultimately like</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">i wanted and you know i i strive for</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">these things to dovetail more like i</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.839" end="00:43:35.040" style="s2">don&#39;t think the zeitgeist movement in</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.040" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">has any kind of conclusion it&#39;s all a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">prelude to some</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">institutional change like we&#39;re all and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">this is why i believe in convergence it</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">needs to</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">it needs to dovetail more and not more</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">people start more spin-off projects</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah um and so uh and none of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">it is perfect right we have to take the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">best of each</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">of each thing and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">that&#39;s my riff on the zombie idea so</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:06.960" style="s2">that&#39;s great um we&#39;re sort of coming to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">the end of the hour</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know if i want to start</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">extending the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">invitation so i&#39;m not trying to close</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">feels like also there&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.440" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve come like this topic has been come</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:55.839" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">sort of like a point of coherence for me</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.839" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">in my mind understanding where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:02.880" style="s2">coming from a lot more clearly now</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">than i did in a previous discussion um</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.880" end="00:45:05.119" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">i&#39;m just also worried about sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.119" end="00:45:08.079" style="s2">logical thing if we start something and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:11.839" style="s2">it&#39;s about five minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.079" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">yeah a dangler i&#39;m inviting you to come</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.839" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">and we get more but what i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">do then</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">is is give you the last five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">to you to whatever last word you want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:25.839" style="s2">say about this</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:27.599" style="s2">so that you don&#39;t feel like i&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.839" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">foreclosed on on</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.599" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">what&#39;s happened between us i thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">today was really good i mean i really</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">like what happened here i thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">there was some really good unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">gear i felt that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:41.040" style="s2">in turn i mean in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">um the manner i thought this was much</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.040" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">much better than</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">our previous recording right i think it</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">was much more flowy and dialogical</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">and so i thought and it felt much more</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">organic to me yeah great thanks</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you experienced it that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">way but that&#39;s how i experienced it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:59.920" style="s2">yeah it felt good and um</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know what my my closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.920" end="00:46:04.319" style="s2">would be um</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">what else have i not have we not touched</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.319" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">on there&#39;s lots more to go on metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:10.079" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah there is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.079" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">there&#39;s you know i mean just so we</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t really define</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">all aspects of it at the outset so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">return to that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">because one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">sort of uh basic parts of the definition</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:27.680" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a transformation not just</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">of the self</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.680" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">but of the world as well totally and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:34.720" style="s2">of your future and your past perception</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.720" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">you know i i it&#39;s so potentially so hard</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">to define in a way that everyone&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">to relate to you know in my draft i kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">of touch on a lot of examples like it</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">you know you you realize a conflict of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">interest or</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">you know you you realize you did</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:54.480" style="s2">something wrong or you atoned for your</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">your past sins and you know i try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.480" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">draw in some concrete examples like</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.720" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">christian picciolini for example is uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">he was an</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">ex neo-nazi you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">and like american history x right like</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">this is a guy who who went in head first</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">uh no pun intended and and he so he came</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">out on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.680" end="00:47:17.760" style="s2">uh an anti-white supremacist speaker</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.240" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s a it&#39;s you know enantio dromio</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.240" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">like it&#39;s a complete inversion</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:26.960" style="s2">of who he was in the best possible sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">because you go from being a nazi to an</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.960" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">anti-nazi</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.599" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">um you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">you know we&#39;re all we&#39;re all nested in</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">systems of control in one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:45.119" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re all through scarcity whether</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.119" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s real scarcity or artificial</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">um we&#39;re compelled to do things that</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">aren&#39;t good uh fundamentally and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">just mean like killing or stealing</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">like part of my moral system</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">where i think i think some people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">aren&#39;t there yet quite frankly and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">not it&#39;s not um an elitist thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just that i i think more</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">sociologically more systemically</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">and so i think of ethics and agency is</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">nested in these systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">and so the only way to be moral is to</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:20.319" style="s2">extricate yourself and in a sense that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.319" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">but at least intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:27.760" style="s2">um you need to is and so like i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">anti-war</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.760" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">kind of advocate right and so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">take a more</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">extreme position and a more alienating</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">and ostracizing position because people</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">just want to argue</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">with you or</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">sorry they want to argue with you about</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">war yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">yeah yeah they want to they want to you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">um equivocate and get you know get get</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">lost in the details</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">like like i i it just baffles me and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not that i&#39;m a a pacifist</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">like if you go deep down that rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">hole</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">uh there&#39;s some push back there too</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">because like there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">argument at the end of the day like well</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">you got to defend yourself and you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">know if you&#39;re being invaded blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">blah</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:14.000" style="s2">and so something we touched on in our</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">last conversation i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">is social paradox yeah yeah so i always</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">idea too because it it traps people</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">right and if you&#39;re gonna get into an</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">with me or with whoever about war</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">uh it&#39;s paradoxical right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">always arguments you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:35.040" style="s2">you can scrape together for war for</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">militarization for conflict for</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.040" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">police brutality whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">and um you know so so i try to be</p>

<p begin="00:50:17.599" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">king</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">are they examples of what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:24.839" style="s2">about right now this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">you know not just individual but also</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.839" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">collective um</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">and in in you know at least culturally</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:32.480" style="s2">revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">right um kind of non-violence but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">not it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not a passive non-violence right</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s an active</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s confrontational it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">trying to provoke transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">is that the kind of thing you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">about because you invoked them earlier</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:48.319" style="s2">as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:49.920" style="s2">it is and it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t because they</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.319" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">embedded themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.920" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">modern religion right religious</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">traditions to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">affect these changes and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">in the case of gandhi not so much king</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">but in gandhi</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s there&#39;s no fault of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">gandhi&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.800" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">there&#39;s debate over the ultimate effect</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.319" style="s2">this is a topic for another day but like</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.319" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">by india achieving independence um</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.680" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">that that led into different periods of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">decline</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:24.400" style="s2">within india and i i traveled there i</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:27.119" style="s2">read some some books on india and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.400" end="00:51:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not a clear topic like they they</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.119" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">revere him and also criticize him</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.520" end="00:51:34.079" style="s2">yeah um so the modern difference with</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">with these things</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.079" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">is is in part that we have to do it a</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">little different but also like</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:42.319" style="s2">invest less in the figureheads and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:44.240" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.319" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">choose the right people to follow but</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.240" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s such a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:49.920" style="s2">at the individual level like we have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">have to have to have a much more</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.920" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">distributed</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">cognition as you would say yes but one</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">that is at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">at a sort of high level that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t equivocate we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:02.880" style="s2">fall for</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:04.319" style="s2">ruses we don&#39;t you know play into these</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.880" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">fallacies and traps</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.319" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">because we&#39;re all this is what politics</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">does because it&#39;s a power game</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">it ends up co-opting people and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">why highly intelligent people like</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">want to step away from it or want to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">meta politics</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">right but i would close with the point</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">to challenge you and as well as zach and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">layman</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:27.040" style="s2">to you know to do the harder thing which</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">is to join me in the ongoing literacy</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.040" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">of of leftist and progressive and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">socialist politics you actually know</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">because you can&#39;t trust virtually</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">anybody in the media ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">except the people who are consistent and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">advocating for the universalist policies</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">right so common expression and defense</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">of leftism</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">is that uh you know that we&#39;re in fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">just advocating for what are now</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">mainstream policies</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">so the the left should be the new center</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">whatever is happening in the current</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">uh with with biden and kamala harris and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">and unit you know quote unquote unity</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:08.319" style="s2">projects and</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">um it&#39;s really you know getting back to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">basics universal healthcare universal</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">uh you know with with the nut with a</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">uh a buffet of policy instruments like</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:24.079" style="s2">ubi and modern monetary theory that</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">enable this paradigm shift well as we</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:27.920" style="s2">get closer</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">layman did bring up ubi and other things</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.920" end="00:53:32.559" style="s2">yeah right he was talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">and so i&#39;m just just just to defend him</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.559" end="00:53:36.319" style="s2">a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">sure yeah there&#39;s lots of puzzle pieces</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.319" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">floating out there</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:41.760" style="s2">and you know andrew yang is for ubi and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">i like him</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.760" end="00:53:46.480" style="s2">in so far as he&#39;s for that but and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:48.319" style="s2">he&#39;ll and he likes bernie</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">you know but what happened over the last</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.319" end="00:53:54.559" style="s2">five years politically</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:58.160" style="s2">is just a mess uh and i and i blame</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.559" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">the i blame a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.160" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">who refused to participate</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">in that discourse and that movement</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">and and in one sense it&#39;s never too late</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:12.800" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:16.000" style="s2">but but we we keep missing these windows</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.800" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">and so um we need to converge</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.000" end="00:54:20.720" style="s2">right we need all these different uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:22.000" style="s2">discourses and communities and political</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.720" end="00:54:25.280" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">to actually consolidate and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.280" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">consolidate under the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">progressive leadership</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">which is somebody like bernie sanders</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">right even though he&#39;s not running for</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">president anymore</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">he&#39;s still active and he&#39;s still an</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">politician and leader and so the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">these things fall apart and get</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">fragmented so easily</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">is not for lack of trying right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:49.119" style="s2">because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">power operates and through and capital</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.119" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">media institutions and uh think tanks</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:57.200" style="s2">you know all of these people hanging on</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">to their power</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">and i guess maybe a way to bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">to religion and to close it out</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">is like uh you know these are</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:08.079" style="s2">you know kind of death denial mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">again and</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.079" end="00:55:11.760" style="s2">we have to recognize how you know our</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">own our own mortality our own collective</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.760" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">mortality and there&#39;s literally nothing</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">to to cling to except these</p>

<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">rather than uh and endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">proliferates</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">in different directions</p>
