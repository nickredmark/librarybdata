<p begin="00:00:14.490" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">and favorite individuals in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:23.960" style="s2">and perhaps two people I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:26.220" style="s2">I would I would please don&#39;t don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.960" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">uncomfortable if I say I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.220" end="00:00:32.279" style="s2">both geniuses of some kind and also I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">think you&#39;re both very almost different</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">polar opposite way like John is so</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.680" end="00:00:44.850" style="s2">conscientious and careful about you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:47.090" style="s2">everything he says and Alexander&#39;s out</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.579" end="00:00:54.809" style="s2">so I loved both those perspectives so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.620" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">think they&#39;re both great even though you</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.809" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">know some people would have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:00.600" style="s2">with Alexander and some people would not</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">be able to get into the intricacies of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.600" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">John and well I love it both I love you</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">guys both like so much and you&#39;ve both</p>

<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">I am on fire</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:16.980" style="s2">discussing some of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:18.330" style="s2">working with at the moment for that book</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">we John tonight and certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.330" end="00:02:23.640" style="s2">dangerous input to mmm and me and John</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">in our last couple conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:28.920" style="s2">Jack Zack and Christopher a mess master</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:31.319" style="s2">Pietro have been talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.920" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">reinventing ideas you know reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.319" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">perennial notions and rethinking things</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:43.319" style="s2">and and something that&#39;s been coming up</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:45.560" style="s2">on the intellectual darkweb discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.319" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">is this idea of a renaissance in</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.560" end="00:02:50.069" style="s2">connector deep web intellectual deep web</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">excuse me it&#39;s this idea for any sauce</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.069" end="00:02:54.269" style="s2">it&#39;s the kid stuff separate from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:56.190" style="s2">panels okay oh it occurred to me that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.269" end="00:02:59.549" style="s2">Alexander wanted to talk about the past</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.190" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">right a renaissance and then John is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.549" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">talking about reinventing and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:06.269" style="s2">futuristic idea what wears on the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:09.060" style="s2">hand Alexander is very much of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.269" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">futuristic philosopher and john is also</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:12.569" style="s2">working on perennial issues I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:14.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound all confused but I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.569" end="00:03:18.840" style="s2">to somehow combine the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.040" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">reinventing reinventing the new world</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.840" end="00:03:24.150" style="s2">the new paradigm whatever&#39;s coming next</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:26.010" style="s2">which seems everybody seems to be agreed</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.150" end="00:03:30.600" style="s2">that we&#39;re moving into an entirely new</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.010" end="00:03:32.549" style="s2">era I wanted to talk about reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:35.670" style="s2">these things and then maybe Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.549" end="00:03:37.829" style="s2">can you can talk about you know this</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.670" end="00:03:40.859" style="s2">comparison between the axial age and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.829" end="00:03:43.889" style="s2">Bronze Age oh yeah what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.859" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">that I did a fantastic podcast called</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.889" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">techno social podcast run by to these</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:54.870" style="s2">wonderful whiz kids they&#39;re into deeper</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">now you get it so Olin and Daniel then</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:03:58.639" style="s2">invited both me and Patrick Ryan to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:01.079" style="s2">a conversation a Patrick Reilly is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.639" end="00:04:03.660" style="s2">amazing North American young mind right</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.079" end="00:04:07.079" style="s2">so and both Patrick Ryan I&#39;ll be working</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.660" end="00:04:08.549" style="s2">towards to sort of reinforce ice the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.079" end="00:04:10.889" style="s2">difference between the Bronze Age and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.549" end="00:04:12.690" style="s2">the axial age because the actual age has</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.889" end="00:04:14.430" style="s2">always been sort of over-represented and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.690" end="00:04:16.349" style="s2">hyped and you know this is wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.430" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">period when all these great thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.349" end="00:04:20.099" style="s2">came forward but in reality I think the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">Bronze Age when actually the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.099" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">constructions and the sort of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">structures that we can now use or have</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">used ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:32.820" style="s2">were created and I&#39;m working with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">shift in this new book I&#39;m doing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.820" end="00:04:36.780" style="s2">Patrick Ryan is doing the same things in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:39.270" style="s2">taneous interestingly enough and and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.780" end="00:04:41.250" style="s2">want to dress that because there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.270" end="00:04:44.760" style="s2">some core issues here that are very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.250" end="00:04:47.880" style="s2">important and I&#39;d love to get into that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.760" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">tonight mm-hmm yeah and John John has</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.880" end="00:04:51.240" style="s2">talked a lot about the axial age and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:53.310" style="s2">you&#39;ve criticized certain aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.240" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">actual age but I think that you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.310" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">much also spoke you also you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:03.570" style="s2">appreciate a lot of the Greeks and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:06.030" style="s2">said that the axial age is it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.570" end="00:05:08.430" style="s2">the grammar of how we think about things</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.030" end="00:05:10.980" style="s2">and that sort of thing so maybe can you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.430" end="00:05:13.560" style="s2">respond to Alexander well I think to not</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.980" end="00:05:15.540" style="s2">thought but yeah I want to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.560" end="00:05:17.790" style="s2">that the word I like to use is we invent</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.540" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">here rather than reinvent because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.790" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">density of captures both invention and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.860" end="00:05:27.540" style="s2">discovery it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:29.880" style="s2">like just remaking so it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.540" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">dactyl point about the indent here is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.880" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a chain of space term it looks back</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:36.450" style="s2">right to what has already been</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:38.130" style="s2">discovered but it looks forward to what</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.450" end="00:05:39.960" style="s2">is to be invented and it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.130" end="00:05:41.250" style="s2">sort of be beyond them which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.960" end="00:05:43.169" style="s2">appropriate for what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.250" end="00:05:46.350" style="s2">here I think we&#39;re actually exemplifying</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.169" end="00:05:49.470" style="s2">that and about the axial age and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.350" end="00:05:53.010" style="s2">Bronze Age there&#39;s so there&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.470" end="00:05:54.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a strand of my thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.010" end="00:05:56.130" style="s2">might connect up with what Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.390" end="00:05:59.130" style="s2">saying so I&#39;ll propose it and then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.130" end="00:06:02.250" style="s2">can we can see if we can riff on it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:04.919" style="s2">this is the idea you know and if I get</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.250" end="00:06:06.419" style="s2">this from Charles Taylor right in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.919" end="00:06:09.000" style="s2">distinction between two continuous cause</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.419" end="00:06:11.640" style="s2">most of the torold mythology and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.000" end="00:06:13.550" style="s2">part of my critique of the axial age is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.640" end="00:06:17.880" style="s2">that for all of the benefits that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.550" end="00:06:19.200" style="s2">alexander already alluded to it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.880" end="00:06:21.720" style="s2">wrapped us into this two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.200" end="00:06:23.220" style="s2">mythology that has been very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.720" end="00:06:26.039" style="s2">problematic and has become increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.220" end="00:06:28.050" style="s2">problematic precisely because I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.039" end="00:06:31.979" style="s2">one of the things the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.050" end="00:06:35.700" style="s2">worldview has done is and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.979" end="00:06:39.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of benefit to this it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.700" end="00:06:41.030" style="s2">it has be embedded us</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.200" end="00:06:45.530" style="s2">to use that word we embedded us back</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.690" end="00:07:18.290" style="s2">is because I think there&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.699" end="00:10:38.809" style="s2">interesting that this is like the peak</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.439" end="00:10:41.540" style="s2">of the Bronze Age this is like 1700</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.319" end="00:11:07.960" style="s2">interesting what later happened was</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.100" end="00:11:10.630" style="s2">we had several Persian empires that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.960" end="00:11:13.540" style="s2">lasted for over 1400 years after that in</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.780" end="00:11:26.500" style="s2">they took was something that existed</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.550" end="00:11:29.020" style="s2">already in no madala G sort of the</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.050" end="00:11:51.550" style="s2">the idea that we could have another</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.550" end="00:11:54.550" style="s2">is a narrative of linear time where</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:04.510" style="s2">changes the rules of the world forever</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.010" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">so this is the original ontology but</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.510" end="00:12:08.920" style="s2">what the surest is did long before the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:10.420" style="s2">sort of pop versions called Islam and</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.420" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">lot of trouble was that the surest us</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.310" end="00:12:18.010" style="s2">understood that they divided the</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.030" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">means you have the Shan Shan the king of</p>

<p begin="00:16:34.290" end="00:16:38.340" style="s2">to me is the logos is the way logos</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.660" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">means the way like no no way so like</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.340" end="00:16:41.580" style="s2">like I just cut the Chinese just cut the</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.190" end="00:16:51.750" style="s2">it&#39;s sore ass there&#39;s concept of ultra</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.750" end="00:16:56.520" style="s2">things work that is logos to the person</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.520" end="00:17:02.850" style="s2">which is how we didn&#39;t create a story</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.850" end="00:17:07.560" style="s2">world and we can allow to fabulet</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:09.510" style="s2">whatever and we keep it separate from</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.560" end="00:17:11.339" style="s2">the logos and there&#39;s also a third story</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.510" end="00:17:13.980" style="s2">with the persons which is pathos and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.339" end="00:17:17.430" style="s2">pathos is anything you want to keep your</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">I&#39;m going I&#39;m working on these three</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.890" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">different types of narratives that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:28.110" style="s2">constantly confuse to one another and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:30.300" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what you know we still do</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.110" end="00:17:32.010" style="s2">it today we can&#39;t keep them separate but</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.300" end="00:17:35.340" style="s2">we must keep them separate to understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.010" end="00:17:37.320" style="s2">the different roles they have it&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.340" end="00:17:38.460" style="s2">want to slow down you thought let me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.320" end="00:17:43.740" style="s2">make sure I&#39;ve got the three there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:44.460" style="s2">logos mere thought a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.740" end="00:17:47.340" style="s2">Lobos</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.460" end="00:17:50.940" style="s2">maybe we can talk more about that pathos</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.340" end="00:17:53.220" style="s2">I mean I have a literary understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.940" end="00:17:55.050" style="s2">of it but I don&#39;t have a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.220" end="00:17:57.660" style="s2">understanding so so say you watch</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.050" end="00:18:00.570" style="s2">pornography okay it gets silly when</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.660" end="00:18:02.490" style="s2">pornography tries to be theatrical if</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.570" end="00:18:05.130" style="s2">they have lines in the pornography it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.490" end="00:18:09.210" style="s2">just it&#39;s just in the way you go</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.130" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">straight to the fuck that is pathos that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.210" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">is pathos so I&#39;m trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:22.530" style="s2">connection that I know in Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:25.710" style="s2">between pathos I avoid pathetic sigh say</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.530" end="00:18:28.020" style="s2">PASOK narrative to avoid pathetic like</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.910" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">have become sort of mixed up and</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.250" end="00:19:25.170" style="s2">so in this triad of power the split</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.220" end="00:19:27.720" style="s2">follows and the matter the matter call</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.170" end="00:19:29.910" style="s2">this is the older sister Miriam and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.720" end="00:19:32.250" style="s2">the chief chain is obviously Aaron and</p>

<p begin="00:28:41.170" end="00:28:44.380" style="s2">Indians I actually converted to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.760" end="00:28:46.270" style="s2">Iranian branch of the religion because</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.380" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">the rawness or a sister</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.270" end="00:28:51.420" style="s2">you can&#39;t convert</p>

<p begin="00:28:51.420" end="00:28:57.180" style="s2">can not allow conversion no sir no parts</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.110" end="00:28:57.540" style="s2">of that community do exactly that does</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.180" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.540" end="00:29:01.590" style="s2">this is totally open discussion about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:03.030" style="s2">in India and it&#39;s basically because the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.590" end="00:29:05.280" style="s2">parties were so successful in India</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.030" end="00:29:09.030" style="s2">because accepted to basically be treated</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.280" end="00:29:10.860" style="s2">as a major Hindu caste higher in their</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.030" end="00:29:12.810" style="s2">caste which they&#39;ve been allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.860" end="00:29:14.250" style="s2">for the last 1000 years because they</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.810" end="00:29:16.440" style="s2">would never convert any Indians to their</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.250" end="00:29:19.110" style="s2">religion but the Iranian branches or</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.440" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">asterism or of course early released</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.110" end="00:29:24.030" style="s2">when they left Iran after the colonies</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:26.760" style="s2">took take over in the 1970s so all them</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.030" end="00:29:28.560" style="s2">all the teachers I had were essentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.760" end="00:29:30.720" style="s2">Iranian professors who arrived in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.560" end="00:29:33.030" style="s2">United States in the 1980s now winters</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:35.220" style="s2">study with him intensely and I decided</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.030" end="00:29:36.900" style="s2">to go into the vest I&#39;m going to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.220" end="00:29:39.450" style="s2">original scripture and I was one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.900" end="00:29:41.280" style="s2">these reformers who basically taught us</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.450" end="00:29:43.230" style="s2">or us and stopped talking about religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.280" end="00:29:46.050" style="s2">as a precursor to Christianity in Islam</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.230" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">so asterism is so great religion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.050" end="00:29:50.190" style="s2">closely connected to Buddhism and Taoism</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.710" style="s2">that&#39;s how it should go right and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.190" end="00:29:54.270" style="s2">has now become the mainstream version</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.710" end="00:29:56.430" style="s2">also wrestling within the community</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.270" end="00:29:58.770" style="s2">itself I think got to see a major</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.430" end="00:30:01.530" style="s2">revolution of Iranian American</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.770" end="00:30:03.750" style="s2">Historians the next 30 years in Chinese</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.730" end="00:30:11.970" style="s2">face say this is all bullshit from the</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.530" end="00:35:07.820" style="s2">to find a richness in Platonic heritage</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.660" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">I mean neoplatonism does be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.820" end="00:35:15.020" style="s2">become a profound kind of monism for</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.250" end="00:35:40.910" style="s2">you mentioned that you are also</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.120" end="00:36:06.080" style="s2">in which he is recognizing profound</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:13.010" style="s2">deeply platonic in this sense the real</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.760" end="00:36:15.050" style="s2">is the rational and the rational is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.010" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">real that&#39;s platonic through and through</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.050" end="00:36:19.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the claim that realness and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:23.090" style="s2">intelligibility of some kind of profound</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.570" end="00:36:26.180" style="s2">identity and so I agree there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.090" end="00:36:29.300" style="s2">discontinuity between Hegel and Plato</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.180" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">and then a goal is moving in a process</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.300" end="00:36:34.250" style="s2">manner but I also see deep platonic</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:36.470" style="s2">elements in Hegel I see deep platonic</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.250" end="00:36:38.450" style="s2">elements in nietzsche to an itchy did</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.470" end="00:36:40.700" style="s2">she knows this he says you know I hate</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.450" end="00:36:43.900" style="s2">Socrates he&#39;s so close to me I&#39;m always</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.900" end="00:36:47.840" style="s2">right and this was part of heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:49.400" style="s2">critique of Nietzsche in fact if he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.840" end="00:36:51.500" style="s2">still all he&#39;s doing is taking the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.400" end="00:36:54.050" style="s2">Platonic worldview and simply inverting</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.500" end="00:36:56.390" style="s2">it he&#39;s not breaking through it and so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.050" end="00:36:57.770" style="s2">mean I&#39;m appreciating I hope you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.390" end="00:36:59.630" style="s2">understand that Alexander I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:36:59.630" end="00:37:05.630" style="s2">I think rather than being anti platonic</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.150" end="00:37:07.340" style="s2">I think I want you I want to put what</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.630" end="00:37:09.950" style="s2">you&#39;re saying into a deep discord</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.340" end="00:37:13.460" style="s2">discourse and dialogue sorry for the pun</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.950" end="00:37:15.380" style="s2">with Plato precisely because I see these</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.460" end="00:37:17.270" style="s2">connections I don&#39;t want to lose all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.380" end="00:37:19.850" style="s2">insights that were gathered from that as</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.270" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">well no I agree completely and you just</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.850" end="00:37:24.200" style="s2">mentioned it the key word there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:26.120" style="s2">Neoplatonism yeah and how would you</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.200" end="00:37:28.190" style="s2">define just to the phone to people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.120" end="00:37:29.270" style="s2">follow us tonight how would you define</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.190" end="00:37:33.290" style="s2">the difference between play to listen</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.270" end="00:37:34.790" style="s2">and neoplatonism so well I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.290" end="00:37:36.140" style="s2">for the historical way of defining it in</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.790" end="00:37:37.340" style="s2">a structural if you&#39;ll allow me a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.140" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">time I&#39;ll try and do a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.340" end="00:37:43.460" style="s2">both please do we&#39;d love you to teach us</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">well so there&#39;s the historical same</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.460" end="00:37:51.910" style="s2">thing that Neoplatonism is basically an</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:56.630" style="s2">attempt to integrate Plato Aristotle and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.910" end="00:37:58.759" style="s2">stoicism into a more comprehensive and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.630" end="00:38:05.019" style="s2">unified framework and what that means</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.759" end="00:38:08.059" style="s2">structurally is a more is a deepening of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.019" end="00:38:09.910" style="s2">the Socratic practice of</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.059" end="00:38:13.369" style="s2">self-examination and self-reflection</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.910" end="00:38:15.979" style="s2">into a process that comes to an explicit</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.369" end="00:38:18.849" style="s2">acknowledgment of the importance of non</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.979" end="00:38:22.099" style="s2">propositional knowing so that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.849" end="00:38:24.289" style="s2">acts but what I would call prospective</p>

<p begin="00:38:24.289" end="00:38:28.339" style="s2">knowing become much more central but</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.479" end="00:38:30.259" style="s2">they never become divorced from</p>

<p begin="00:38:30.259" end="00:38:35.690" style="s2">you see in plutinos is this one sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.779" end="00:38:38.239" style="s2">wonderful integration so the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.690" end="00:38:41.989" style="s2">goes from being sort of between people</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.239" end="00:38:44.329" style="s2">in Platonists you have argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.989" end="00:38:46.009" style="s2">a spiritual exercise in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.329" end="00:38:47.779" style="s2">undergoing the transformation of</p>

<p begin="00:38:50.029" end="00:38:54.289" style="s2">on their own they are they are</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:56.719" style="s2">inadequate but when sewing together only</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.289" end="00:39:00.739" style="s2">that will give you the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.719" end="00:39:02.989" style="s2">integration of the love of truth and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.739" end="00:39:05.569" style="s2">love of beauty that will take you to</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.989" end="00:39:08.029" style="s2">what has always been at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.569" end="00:39:10.219" style="s2">reason motivating reason but is</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.029" end="00:39:13.009" style="s2">ultimately beyond reason and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.219" end="00:39:15.619" style="s2">central movie neoplatonism and and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.009" end="00:39:17.900" style="s2">then the idea is that whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.619" end="00:39:19.190" style="s2">that is ultimate and it&#39;s the source of</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.900" end="00:39:21.319" style="s2">intelligibility the source of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.190" end="00:39:22.910" style="s2">normativity it has to be that which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.319" end="00:39:25.519" style="s2">beyond even the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.910" end="00:39:26.869" style="s2">truth goodness and beauty the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.519" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">distinction between subject and object</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.869" end="00:39:32.299" style="s2">it can have no other because all</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:34.670" style="s2">intelligibility comes from it in fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.299" end="00:39:37.460" style="s2">the finest even says it&#39;s beyond being</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.670" end="00:39:41.229" style="s2">because even our notions of being right</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.460" end="00:39:46.249" style="s2">involve some kind of implicit dualism</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.229" end="00:39:48.739" style="s2">and so for me again i reject a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.249" end="00:39:50.779" style="s2">neoplatonism by the way hey I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.739" end="00:39:52.729" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of it that doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.779" end="00:39:54.170" style="s2">with what we&#39;re talking about or what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.729" end="00:39:58.130" style="s2">think is relevant</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.170" end="00:40:00.260" style="s2">but if you&#39;ll allow me the process and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.130" end="00:40:02.029" style="s2">the grammar of neoplatonism I think of</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.260" end="00:40:04.490" style="s2">something deeply right in them about</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.029" end="00:40:07.069" style="s2">this idea about how can we knit together</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.490" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">all the kinds of knowing and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.069" end="00:40:11.690" style="s2">knit together but the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">dialectic in the intra ontological</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.690" end="00:40:16.670" style="s2">dialectic so that people can experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:19.369" style="s2">a profound kind of transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.670" end="00:40:21.319" style="s2">transcendence and so that if the deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.369" end="00:40:24.230" style="s2">connections between intelligibility and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.319" end="00:40:25.250" style="s2">being and transformation are</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.230" end="00:40:26.900" style="s2">exploitative</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.250" end="00:40:30.079" style="s2">and made available to people as</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.900" end="00:40:32.150" style="s2">practices not just as ideas that for me</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.079" end="00:40:33.410" style="s2">is the central I want to keep that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.150" end="00:40:35.240" style="s2">grammar I think that grammar is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.410" end="00:40:37.720" style="s2">important they&#39;re valuable and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.240" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">forget that but kindness enters into a</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:44.660" style="s2">because he sees the nothing he sees the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.890" end="00:40:46.609" style="s2">not I mean he&#39;s got a he&#39;s got he&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:40:46.609" end="00:40:52.190" style="s2">Gnostics as having a kind of similarity</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.819" end="00:40:54.500" style="s2">to what he&#39;s doing but actually also a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.190" end="00:40:56.839" style="s2">deep difference and he&#39;s very he takes</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.500" end="00:40:57.650" style="s2">great pains to try and separate what</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.839" end="00:41:00.940" style="s2">he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.650" end="00:41:03.829" style="s2">from Gnosticism explicitly so in fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.940" end="00:41:05.509" style="s2">okay we use Platonists in our work</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.829" end="00:41:06.980" style="s2">zeddicus tonight because we were looking</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.509" end="00:41:09.650" style="s2">at Jacques Lacan snorty law</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.980" end="00:41:12.200" style="s2">psychoanalysis it&#39;s like this drive and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.650" end="00:41:15.349" style="s2">there&#39;s desire so desire is the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.200" end="00:41:16.609" style="s2">so from language you know we create</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.349" end="00:41:19.339" style="s2">oddities and things but drive is just</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.609" end="00:41:22.579" style="s2">the incessant drive but I found that</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.339" end="00:41:26.359" style="s2">kind of poor and to begin with Lacan</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.579" end="00:41:28.009" style="s2">ignores instinct a lot of a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.359" end="00:41:30.650" style="s2">behaviors instinctual which we call</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.009" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">animalistic behavior on top about we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.650" end="00:41:34.099" style="s2">I&#39;ve dry which is like a mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:37.269" style="s2">behavior we can then have decide which</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.099" end="00:41:40.519" style="s2">is symbolic behavior but we also added</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.269" end="00:41:41.930" style="s2">transcendence as a drive oh yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.519" end="00:41:44.869" style="s2">clearly in human beings</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.930" end="00:41:47.180" style="s2">you cannot put transcendence they do for</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.869" end="00:41:49.190" style="s2">the above for the higher for for</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.180" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">whatever we could you know but but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.190" end="00:41:52.730" style="s2">also what we do then is to be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:54.500" style="s2">trace that back into history because in</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.730" end="00:41:57.890" style="s2">the original no mythology when</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.500" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">everything is returned are the same you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.890" end="00:42:01.519" style="s2">don&#39;t really have that concept and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:03.799" style="s2">trace that again back to the roster and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.519" end="00:42:07.099" style="s2">see it and explode through Heraclitus in</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.799" end="00:42:08.030" style="s2">Pluto nose because it is with Zoroaster</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.099" end="00:42:09.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.030" end="00:42:11.030" style="s2">discovered that while the daughter is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.320" end="00:42:12.950" style="s2">still just copying the mother because</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.030" end="00:42:14.570" style="s2">she is a force of nature she gives birth</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.950" end="00:42:18.230" style="s2">to children he&#39;s just a natural process</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.230" end="00:42:21.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to mimic the father</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.400" end="00:42:22.520" style="s2">completely he can actually make the</p>

<p begin="00:43:14.030" end="00:43:17.120" style="s2">my understanding is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.020" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">fundamental sense it in the sense of</p>

<p begin="00:44:43.590" end="00:44:47.160" style="s2">if the only change that ever happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.330" end="00:44:47.790" style="s2">was technological and we human haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.160" end="00:44:49.950" style="s2">changed at all</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.790" end="00:44:52.920" style="s2">so I wanted to bring Randy Girard into</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.950" end="00:44:56.190" style="s2">the conversation here because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.920" end="00:44:58.550" style="s2">talking about of ontology being the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.190" end="00:45:01.230" style="s2">beginning of a sort of recorded time</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.550" end="00:45:03.300" style="s2">which is when the Hebrew Bible comes in</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.230" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">and when and when the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.300" end="00:45:10.290" style="s2">scapegoat you know according to Girard</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:14.280" style="s2">gets gets gets comes into into the idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.290" end="00:45:17.730" style="s2">that that it&#39;s not you know we move from</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.280" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">mythology right into EV ontology or in</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.730" end="00:45:24.300" style="s2">in a sense right we move into like</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:26.250" style="s2">historical truth the West did but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.300" end="00:45:29.070" style="s2">East did not so mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.250" end="00:45:30.690" style="s2">because the Chinese I have I&#39;ve had all</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.070" end="00:45:32.280" style="s2">these podcasts this to spring with all</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.690" end="00:45:33.780" style="s2">these Indian amazing thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.280" end="00:45:35.940" style="s2">artists and everything and they always</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.780" end="00:45:37.710" style="s2">talk about India&#39;s just circular time we</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.940" end="00:45:39.300" style="s2">circular time this whole idea linear</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.710" end="00:45:40.980" style="s2">time is a very Western thing time but</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.300" end="00:45:44.220" style="s2">the thought I had was that maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.980" end="00:45:49.950" style="s2">the the this the the revelation of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.220" end="00:45:51.780" style="s2">scapegoat arises at the same time Rene</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.950" end="00:45:53.730" style="s2">sure are does not discuss anything prior</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.780" end="00:45:55.410" style="s2">to Christianity he doesn&#39;t even dig into</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.730" end="00:45:59.010" style="s2">the origin of dude oh that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.410" end="00:46:00.420" style="s2">okay no he doesn&#39;t go all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.010" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">to his arrest is that what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.420" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">I mean obviously influence Christian</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.400" end="00:46:07.950" style="s2">early Christianity normally but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:10.710" style="s2">that we could have one scapegoat once</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.950" end="00:46:12.600" style="s2">and for all on a cross so we won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.710" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">any scapegoats in long which is Rene</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.600" end="00:46:16.500" style="s2">a-rod&#39;s fundamentally interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:19.050" style="s2">the contribution or Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.500" end="00:46:21.270" style="s2">better they can only curry he first have</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.050" end="00:46:24.750" style="s2">an idea that you can live in an ontology</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.270" end="00:46:27.210" style="s2">and that one man&#39;s act can change</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.750" end="00:46:30.510" style="s2">history forever and this is fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.210" end="00:46:33.210" style="s2">to Christianity in the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.510" end="00:46:35.130" style="s2">Incarnation separably bound up together</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.210" end="00:46:37.200" style="s2">but what I was but</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.130" end="00:46:38.549" style="s2">I think let me let me let me try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:42.059" style="s2">bring this around when I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.549" end="00:46:45.479" style="s2">say I see what you&#39;re saying in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.059" end="00:46:46.739" style="s2">the if you&#39;ll allow me these these</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.479" end="00:46:48.779" style="s2">metaphors I see the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.739" end="00:46:51.869" style="s2">progression through time that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.779" end="00:46:53.729" style="s2">talking about here but what I see with</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.869" end="00:46:56.039" style="s2">what the Greeks still gave us was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.729" end="00:46:57.809" style="s2">recognition of another progression which</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.039" end="00:46:59.910" style="s2">is a vertical progression between levels</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.809" end="00:47:01.950" style="s2">of ontology and that&#39;s what Platonists</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.910" end="00:47:04.049" style="s2">to me is bringing out in a very very</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.950" end="00:47:06.329" style="s2">powerful way now I think the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.049" end="00:47:08.670" style="s2">obsession with this can the neglect of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.329" end="00:47:10.349" style="s2">this is a mistake but I think if we just</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.670" end="00:47:12.509" style="s2">talked about the horizontal movement</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.349" end="00:47:14.069" style="s2">through time without also talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.509" end="00:47:16.920" style="s2">the vertical movement through levels of</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.069" end="00:47:18.539" style="s2">ontology that&#39;s also a mistake oh we</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.920" end="00:47:21.509" style="s2">need some way to talk about the two of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.539" end="00:47:23.279" style="s2">them together in an integrated fashion</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.509" end="00:47:26.940" style="s2">can you explain what Potamus means for</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.279" end="00:47:28.890" style="s2">that with the vertical halogen those are</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.940" end="00:47:31.470" style="s2">models of what floatiness means by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.890" end="00:47:35.430" style="s2">vertical ontology so every theories in</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.470" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">there is a motion but it and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.430" end="00:47:42.539" style="s2">sense in which you could see it as a I</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to be mistaken for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.539" end="00:47:49.710" style="s2">eternal return of the same but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:53.190" style="s2">idea that there is you start with the 1</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.710" end="00:47:54.719" style="s2">and then it emanates into so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.190" end="00:47:58.349" style="s2">progression that there&#39;s an overflow</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.719" end="00:48:01.319" style="s2">into the different principles that then</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.349" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">overflow into each principle you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.319" end="00:48:06.690" style="s2">ground multiple patterns and then those</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:09.180" style="s2">patterns flow into multiple events and</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.690" end="00:48:10.979" style="s2">things but those events and things are</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.180" end="00:48:13.650" style="s2">only real to degree to which they</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.979" end="00:48:16.589" style="s2">integrate and then so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.650" end="00:48:19.589" style="s2">progression right of emanation and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.589" end="00:48:21.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a return of emergence and so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.589" end="00:48:23.789" style="s2">even think about this in our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.630" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">language where we talked about you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.789" end="00:48:29.880" style="s2">the higher order is emerging up from the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:32.849" style="s2">quantum but also things emanating down</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.880" end="00:48:35.940" style="s2">from the cosmological relativistic scale</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.849" end="00:48:38.999" style="s2">and so this is a de movement through</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.940" end="00:48:42.059" style="s2">time it&#39;s the movement between levels of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.999" end="00:48:45.140" style="s2">being and it is also important for</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.059" end="00:48:48.630" style="s2">understanding the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.140" end="00:48:50.940" style="s2">intelligibility transformation</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.630" end="00:48:53.370" style="s2">sentence and being and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.940" end="00:48:56.100" style="s2">Platonists is a master of this I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.370" end="00:48:58.530" style="s2">he has nothing of value to say about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.100" end="00:49:01.020" style="s2">horizontal and so I&#39;m acknowledging that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.530" end="00:49:03.810" style="s2">but I think talking about just the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.020" end="00:49:06.570" style="s2">horizontal right without talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.810" end="00:49:08.490" style="s2">both and I meet an I&#39;m using horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.570" end="00:49:10.770" style="s2">to mean historical in the profound way</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.490" end="00:49:12.570" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about it Alexander okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.770" end="00:49:14.250" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean it in any trendiest on</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.570" end="00:49:16.320" style="s2">so I mean it in a you know a deeply a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.250" end="00:49:20.100" style="s2">Gillian Nietzschean sense of historical</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.320" end="00:49:23.490" style="s2">I get that but and I think the part that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.100" end="00:49:25.260" style="s2">I see Nietzsche hungering for and not</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.490" end="00:49:27.480" style="s2">being able to articulate he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.260" end="00:49:29.640" style="s2">get it with the ubermensch and that man</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.480" end="00:49:31.590" style="s2">is something that must be overcome and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.640" end="00:49:33.840" style="s2">what have you done to overcome him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.590" end="00:49:35.610" style="s2">trying to get this as well and he</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.840" end="00:49:40.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know how to do it precisely</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.610" end="00:49:42.270" style="s2">because he has also strongly rejected</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.230" end="00:49:44.220" style="s2">the Platonic tradition not without</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.270" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">reason by the way but he is so strongly</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.220" end="00:49:49.650" style="s2">rejected it that he has he has</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:51.510" style="s2">emasculated him himself with from any</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.650" end="00:49:54.120" style="s2">language that will allow him to talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.510" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">even within a month new state framework</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.120" end="00:49:58.830" style="s2">of the law the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:50:01.710" style="s2">levels of being and so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.830" end="00:50:03.240" style="s2">want to I want to bring together I I</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.710" end="00:50:05.670" style="s2">agree with what you&#39;re talking about I</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.240" end="00:50:07.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s important I mean no no</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.670" end="00:50:10.770" style="s2">important sorry I was about to be too</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.950" end="00:50:13.470" style="s2">pretentious I would predict that no</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.770" end="00:50:15.330" style="s2">important process thinker doesn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.470" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">seriously the deep interconnections</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.330" end="00:50:21.840" style="s2">between being time intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:24.030" style="s2">process event Kairos of course right</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.840" end="00:50:26.490" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.030" end="00:50:29.070" style="s2">between history as a narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.490" end="00:50:30.690" style="s2">science as a neurological but the noma</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.070" end="00:50:32.100" style="s2">logical is nevertheless real the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.690" end="00:50:34.470" style="s2">relationship between the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.100" end="00:50:36.750" style="s2">reality is also a deep affordance of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.470" end="00:50:39.690" style="s2">human transcendence and transformation</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.750" end="00:50:41.580" style="s2">so I want the vertical integrated with</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.690" end="00:50:42.990" style="s2">the horizontal yeah what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.580" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">with my students is they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.990" end="00:50:50.430" style="s2">an emergence vector theory and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:53.180" style="s2">field is going to be called</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.430" end="00:50:56.460" style="s2">transcendental emergentism</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.180" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">and finally I just want to preciate that</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.460" end="00:51:00.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what yeah these students are so</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:01.530" style="s2">clever and this is this guy Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.660" end="00:51:03.420" style="s2">Brady</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.530" end="00:51:05.700" style="s2">he&#39;s 27 years old on Denmark he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.420" end="00:51:07.410" style="s2">fucking genius and I warned him and told</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.700" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">him you&#39;d probably be in a madhouse five</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.410" end="00:51:10.830" style="s2">years so now because you&#39;re that smart</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:12.360" style="s2">yeah we tried to keep you sane because</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.830" end="00:51:12.930" style="s2">then I can just work with you he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.360" end="00:51:14.610" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.930" end="00:51:16.080" style="s2">so I&#39;m working on towards his</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.610" end="00:51:19.020" style="s2">transcendental emergencies and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.080" end="00:51:22.080" style="s2">basically to get out of this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.020" end="00:51:24.060" style="s2">either the psyche in one end has to go</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.080" end="00:51:26.460" style="s2">all the way back to the very bottom or</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.060" end="00:51:29.190" style="s2">at the very bottom there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.460" end="00:51:30.840" style="s2">a you know original atom that then is</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.190" end="00:51:33.630" style="s2">just goes all the way up to the top</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.840" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">because both these reduction isms they</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.630" end="00:51:37.560" style="s2">just do reverse reduction is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:39.740" style="s2">both wrong so we can finally started</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.560" end="00:51:42.330" style="s2">physics separately from biology</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.740" end="00:51:45.060" style="s2">separately from chemistry excited</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.330" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">separate different mind you you just you</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.060" end="00:51:50.130" style="s2">just defined different emerges that have</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:51.990" style="s2">happened in history space-time occurred</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.130" end="00:51:55.560" style="s2">right after the Big Bounce by the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.990" end="00:51:57.570" style="s2">which is fascinating and and and when</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.560" end="00:52:00.270" style="s2">these things happen somewhere along this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.570" end="00:52:03.480" style="s2">or they&#39;re events then event ology and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.270" end="00:52:06.060" style="s2">then suddenly there&#39;s a whole new set of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.480" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">rules for that specific field we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.060" end="00:52:09.630" style="s2">call them laws of nature just habits of</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:11.160" style="s2">nature if you like so you can start at</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.630" end="00:52:13.500" style="s2">them separately without having one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.160" end="00:52:15.210" style="s2">them has been primary to get out of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.500" end="00:52:16.920" style="s2">idea that either physics is from by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.210" end="00:52:19.350" style="s2">way I&#39;m gonna kill the primacy of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.920" end="00:52:20.790" style="s2">physics by having a sub physics prior to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.350" end="00:52:22.350" style="s2">it because that&#39;s what mathematics gets</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.790" end="00:52:25.170" style="s2">stopped at the moment so we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.350" end="00:52:27.780" style="s2">on a really weird Whitehead II an idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.170" end="00:52:33.270" style="s2">or something that&#39;s prior to all</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.780" end="00:52:35.310" style="s2">relations okay but why did why could</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.270" end="00:52:37.230" style="s2">told us it would be spooky once we got</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.310" end="00:52:39.150" style="s2">there right but physics has to go then</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.230" end="00:52:40.650" style="s2">he has to get out of physics and move</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.150" end="00:52:42.600" style="s2">into sub physics and that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.650" end="00:52:44.100" style="s2">because you did rid of the premises we</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.600" end="00:52:46.170" style="s2">don&#39;t want the primacy yet we&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.100" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">solidly be able to study these different</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.170" end="00:52:50.250" style="s2">pockets and we call emergent vectors</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:51.480" style="s2">okay so now now this this is great I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.250" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">glad to hear this because this now</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.480" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">allows me to make a more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:56.910" style="s2">performant precise version the question</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:52:59.250" style="s2">I want to make because I&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.910" end="00:53:00.540" style="s2">somebody I&#39;ve been reading your Aegina</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.250" end="00:53:02.490" style="s2">you know is they called the 9th century</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.540" end="00:53:03.360" style="s2">halo because he basically took that</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.490" end="00:53:06.530" style="s2">Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.360" end="00:53:08.700" style="s2">idea really deeply and he tried to</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.530" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">because what I see happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.700" end="00:53:12.810" style="s2">in the West</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:14.830" style="s2">I can&#39;t pronounce as widely as you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.810" end="00:53:17.260" style="s2">now see this competition between</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.830" end="00:53:19.300" style="s2">bottom-up emergence which is sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.260" end="00:53:22.210" style="s2">know broadly called a naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.300" end="00:53:24.220" style="s2">worldview and then you know often very</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.210" end="00:53:26.950" style="s2">decadent forms of neoplatonism with some</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.220" end="00:53:29.190" style="s2">kind of emanation metaphysics and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.950" end="00:53:31.780" style="s2">era Gina said is no no they they are</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.190" end="00:53:33.550" style="s2">absolutely interdependent in inter</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.780" end="00:53:35.410" style="s2">fording and trying to make one primary</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.550" end="00:53:37.930" style="s2">over the other and he basically argued</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.410" end="00:53:40.090" style="s2">that reality was ultimately dialectic in</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.930" end="00:53:42.250" style="s2">nature for precisely that reason but</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.090" end="00:53:44.410" style="s2">it&#39;s not a he billion dialectic this way</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.250" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a dialectic this way and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.410" end="00:53:49.090" style="s2">I&#39;m so fascinated by his work now that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:51.820" style="s2">allows me to formulate my question to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.090" end="00:53:54.190" style="s2">you because I think we&#39;re in agreement</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.820" end="00:53:55.720" style="s2">about monism and I think we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.190" end="00:54:01.330" style="s2">agreement about what we&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.720" end="00:54:02.470" style="s2">talking about so and I hope the question</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.330" end="00:54:04.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come off as too simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.470" end="00:54:06.790" style="s2">because I think we&#39;re we&#39;ve got you I</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.540" end="00:54:09.910" style="s2">want to feel it I want I&#39;m asking you to</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.790" end="00:54:15.490" style="s2">feel it impregnating the question how do</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.910" end="00:54:18.040" style="s2">we separate the metaphysics if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.490" end="00:54:20.380" style="s2">allow me that of monism from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.040" end="00:54:22.900" style="s2">epistemology of reductionism because</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.380" end="00:54:25.540" style="s2">typically and I see this in so many</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.900" end="00:54:28.060" style="s2">thinkers the way they try to argue for</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.540" end="00:54:30.190" style="s2">monism right is they try to give a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.060" end="00:54:32.140" style="s2">privilege to one of these directions</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.190" end="00:54:33.099" style="s2">over the other so you&#39;re nodding so you</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.140" end="00:54:36.250" style="s2">understand my question</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.099" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">oh yeah I would go to Spinoza right away</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.250" end="00:54:42.250" style="s2">and just say that&#39;s one substance and an</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:43.570" style="s2">infinite amount not infinite to them you</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.250" end="00:54:47.859" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t see you sort of an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.570" end="00:54:50.230" style="s2">amount of attributes well basically I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.859" end="00:54:52.690" style="s2">saying here again it would go to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.230" end="00:54:53.859" style="s2">narratives that I&#39;m working with you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.690" end="00:54:55.150" style="s2">know I&#39;m gonna stay with the process of</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.859" end="00:54:57.480" style="s2">n for the book otherwise it gets too</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.150" end="00:55:00.190" style="s2">thick right but when I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.480" end="00:55:02.589" style="s2">narratives I most explain the pathos and</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.190" end="00:55:05.020" style="s2">missiles and logos none of them is</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.589" end="00:55:07.240" style="s2">primary you got understand that Nautilus</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.020" end="00:55:09.820" style="s2">primary need all three we are all three</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.240" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s specifically now in the machine</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.820" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">and artificial intelligence is coming</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:16.180" style="s2">along because what I&#39;m essentially doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:18.460" style="s2">is philosophers I&#39;m preparing us humans</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.180" end="00:55:21.880" style="s2">to a machine that will ask us in 30</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.460" end="00:55:24.230" style="s2">years from now who are you that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.880" end="00:55:26.090" style="s2">work with technology thirty years ago</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.230" end="00:55:27.410" style="s2">we work with humanity now because</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:41.660" style="s2">pathos is what will be human machines</p>

<p begin="00:59:37.040" end="00:59:41.870" style="s2">Heidegger to pick up on this when he</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.350" end="00:59:44.660" style="s2">talks about the etymology of logos is</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.870" end="00:59:46.730" style="s2">not originally speech but it&#39;s it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.660" end="00:59:48.590" style="s2">gather things together so that they come</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.730" end="00:59:51.530" style="s2">to belong together it&#39;s not be strong</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.590" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">thing there&#39;s a confusion about</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.530" end="00:59:58.730" style="s2">you guys both define logos I think here</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="01:00:00.500" style="s2">cannot again can I add another take if</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.730" end="01:00:02.330" style="s2">you take a fraud in perspective this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.500" end="01:00:05.270" style="s2">the controllable and the uncontrollable</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.330" end="01:00:07.250" style="s2">so that&#39;s exactly what sexuality is so</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.270" end="01:00:10.820" style="s2">central to Freud because it&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.250" end="01:00:13.510" style="s2">it&#39;s we&#39;re obsessed with it and it has</p>

<p begin="01:00:13.510" end="01:00:18.920" style="s2">all the time and that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.280" end="01:00:20.450" style="s2">that&#39;s path fake and of course then the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.920" end="01:00:22.850" style="s2">machine that does the errors and ones</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.450" end="01:00:25.400" style="s2">cannot even grasp that we did that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.850" end="01:00:26.900" style="s2">still be left to us to do it but this of</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.400" end="01:00:29.240" style="s2">course where art comes into the picture</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.900" end="01:00:31.460" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why you can never tell</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.240" end="01:00:33.140" style="s2">art but it has to be good for society</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.460" end="01:00:35.300" style="s2">anything like that all art is just</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.140" end="01:00:37.940" style="s2">causing havoc I&#39;m wrecking very shamanic</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.300" end="01:00:39.710" style="s2">and but it is truly transformative if</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.940" end="01:00:41.060" style="s2">you go through a deep artistic</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.710" end="01:00:43.160" style="s2">experience you come out it was like</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.060" end="01:00:44.930" style="s2">shocked but you&#39;re different and event</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.160" end="01:00:47.150" style="s2">happened you&#39;re different and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.930" end="01:00:48.830" style="s2">I place those in pathos I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.150" end="01:00:49.370" style="s2">you&#39;re probably better brain scientists</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.830" end="01:00:51.290" style="s2">than me</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.370" end="01:00:52.850" style="s2">John so don&#39;t take it too literally but</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.290" end="01:00:54.530" style="s2">at least I&#39;m allowing people to</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.850" end="01:00:56.990" style="s2">understand that if you think of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.530" end="01:00:58.940" style="s2">narratives like pathos will never be</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.990" end="01:01:02.180" style="s2">clear passes is always be confused and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.940" end="01:01:04.430" style="s2">messy at best artistic and very very</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.180" end="01:01:06.500" style="s2">fluid and in a heart interpret whereas</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.430" end="01:01:09.250" style="s2">logos is basically mathematics you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.500" end="01:01:11.600" style="s2">zeros and ones and and then missiles</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.250" end="01:01:13.550" style="s2">exactly that store the connection you</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.600" end="01:01:16.100" style="s2">call that insight and I agree with you I</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.550" end="01:01:18.140" style="s2">would just end it sort of ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.100" end="01:01:21.650" style="s2">year perspective narrative here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.140" end="01:01:23.570" style="s2">history I would call that missiles you</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.650" end="01:01:25.610" style="s2">explain the insight if I have an insight</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.570" end="01:01:27.140" style="s2">and won&#39;t explain it to you I would have</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.610" end="01:01:29.060" style="s2">a mystical narrative to explain it</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.140" end="01:01:30.920" style="s2">because logical narrative will be too</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.060" end="01:01:34.550" style="s2">cheap and Pathak on there can be too</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.920" end="01:01:37.310" style="s2">confusing okay so I guess what I guess</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.550" end="01:01:39.980" style="s2">what I&#39;m resisting and what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.310" end="01:01:42.950" style="s2">to me is I think one of the problems</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.980" end="01:01:46.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve fallen into and I think and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.950" end="01:01:49.250" style="s2">think I can call Heidegger as an ally in</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.520" end="01:01:51.530" style="s2">this is the reduction of logos to logic</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.250" end="01:01:54.440" style="s2">and so I&#39;m critical of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.530" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">identification of logos with logic I</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.440" end="01:01:58.070" style="s2">think that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:02:00.050" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a mistake I agree</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.070" end="01:02:02.900" style="s2">completely and going back to so roster</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.050" end="01:02:05.480" style="s2">again our Shaw which is prior to logos</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.900" end="01:02:07.490" style="s2">Persian Austra means how things work</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.480" end="01:02:09.500" style="s2">but also some ethical principle then</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.490" end="01:02:11.780" style="s2">becomes a shove a he stuff she says like</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.500" end="01:02:13.400" style="s2">if you build on how things work</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.780" end="01:02:15.710" style="s2">you can suddenly make the world better</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.400" end="01:02:20.080" style="s2">well this sounds a lot similar to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.710" end="01:02:20.080" style="s2">way Dharma works</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.890" end="01:02:26.570" style="s2">so the logos is way more than logic or</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.020" end="01:02:28.070" style="s2">mathematics yes students maybe I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.570" end="01:02:30.230" style="s2">rushing here a bit and creating a</p>

<p begin="01:02:36.890" end="01:02:41.180" style="s2">put the name logo some machine sure</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.990" end="01:02:43.910" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s notion was the locals</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.180" end="01:02:46.070" style="s2">as the as the the order that comes from</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.910" end="01:02:48.859" style="s2">chaos the sacred order that comes from</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.070" end="01:02:51.380" style="s2">chaos and so Jordans view is I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.859" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">like mine and I got to talk to Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.380" end="01:03:01.040" style="s2">before he became a god there was a lot</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:02.600" style="s2">of because he and I both see logos and</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.040" end="01:03:04.190" style="s2">we both independently were using it at</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.600" end="01:03:07.670" style="s2">our lectures and that actually came up</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.190" end="01:03:10.430" style="s2">in our in that public debate we had we</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.670" end="01:03:11.840" style="s2">both see it more I think of logos is</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.430" end="01:03:13.760" style="s2">much closer to what I talk about when I</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.840" end="01:03:16.010" style="s2">talk about relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:18.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see inside I think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.010" end="01:03:23.150" style="s2">logos is much more like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.500" end="01:03:25.250" style="s2">certainly very similar to how Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.150" end="01:03:28.280" style="s2">and then through Heidegger Dreyfuss is</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.250" end="01:03:30.200" style="s2">talking about the process of sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.280" end="01:03:33.020" style="s2">making it not the way it&#39;s being used</p>

<p begin="01:04:06.140" end="01:04:10.640" style="s2">be a there has to be a relation for</p>

<p begin="01:04:26.450" end="01:04:34.340" style="s2">logos and passes rich huge I guess you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.090" end="01:04:37.070" style="s2">avoid simplicity&#39;s right definitely yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.340" end="01:04:40.730" style="s2">agree well I guess there&#39;s a point here</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.070" end="01:04:43.520" style="s2">that logos if it&#39;s cut off from mythos</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.730" end="01:04:46.130" style="s2">becomes kind of an autistic as a type of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.520" end="01:04:48.560" style="s2">expression it&#39;s not embodied or</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.130" end="01:04:57.470" style="s2">something like that it becomes purely</p>

<p begin="01:04:57.470" end="01:05:02.540" style="s2">my league here and and I would say I</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.869" end="01:05:06.500" style="s2">would say the kales is pathos and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.540" end="01:05:07.940" style="s2">order is logos but to explain logos to</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.500" end="01:05:09.710" style="s2">any kind of audience you would mean if</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.940" end="01:05:11.570" style="s2">us that&#39;s how I would look at it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.710" end="01:05:13.970" style="s2">maybe a work of art would have to have</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.570" end="01:05:15.530" style="s2">all three of those elements in it to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.970" end="01:05:18.530" style="s2">a complete work of art right would have</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.530" end="01:05:22.490" style="s2">to have a logo but have to have a you</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.530" end="01:05:23.720" style="s2">know they&#39;re also about to be a</p>

<p begin="01:05:25.790" end="01:05:30.320" style="s2">would be of keeping art within pathos</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.859" end="01:05:31.910" style="s2">and not try to make mythos an art form</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.320" end="01:05:34.310" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think in that series is</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.910" end="01:05:36.470" style="s2">art but I also don&#39;t think that logical</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.310" end="01:05:39.230" style="s2">operations or any extended version of</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.470" end="01:05:41.090" style="s2">logos necessarily czar I would Rachel</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.230" end="01:05:43.490" style="s2">here I would probably agree with me that</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.090" end="01:05:46.190" style="s2">art has to stay in the dark in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.490" end="01:05:48.170" style="s2">passions and be unexplainable don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.190" end="01:05:50.119" style="s2">try to turn art into something good</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.170" end="01:05:51.890" style="s2">right but that sounds like that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.119" end="01:05:54.890" style="s2">to me like you would then be excluding</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.890" end="01:05:57.530" style="s2">poesis and poetry from art and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.890" end="01:05:59.780" style="s2">seems to me problematic because I mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.530" end="01:06:03.830" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a clear understanding</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.780" end="01:06:05.359" style="s2">that poesis is also like is also deeply</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.830" end="01:06:07.940" style="s2">involved with logos especially the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.359" end="01:06:10.390" style="s2">on try to explain logos and that polices</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.940" end="01:06:12.830" style="s2">of mogo&#39;s are deeply bound up together</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.390" end="01:06:16.030" style="s2">okay this is where our differentiate</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.830" end="01:06:19.780" style="s2">between places and philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.030" end="01:06:23.060" style="s2">philosophies attempt to become an</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.780" end="01:06:25.880" style="s2">incarnate logos whereas I put poetry in</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.060" end="01:06:28.520" style="s2">the Pathak room well you said Alexander</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.880" end="01:06:29.280" style="s2">that an art form transforms you in some</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.520" end="01:06:33.120" style="s2">kind of a way</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.280" end="01:06:37.770" style="s2">for me like that has to be I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.120" end="01:06:39.840" style="s2">is that that has does not have to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.770" end="01:06:42.180" style="s2">bound up with with with something more</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.840" end="01:06:44.850" style="s2">than just you know sensual experience or</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.180" end="01:06:46.980" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be another dimension</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.850" end="01:06:48.750" style="s2">transformative in the sense that is just</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.980" end="01:06:50.760" style="s2">changed I&#39;m thinking de Lucia just</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.750" end="01:06:53.400" style="s2">change it is different you might be</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.760" end="01:06:54.510" style="s2">minor or shocked or shell-shocked and</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.400" end="01:06:56.970" style="s2">whatever when you come out of that</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.510" end="01:06:58.620" style="s2">experience an artist does not take any</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.970" end="01:07:01.530" style="s2">responsibility for how you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.620" end="01:07:05.040" style="s2">perceive the art not at all definitely</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.530" end="01:07:07.470" style="s2">not so I would say that education is</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.040" end="01:07:09.480" style="s2">transformative but it has a clear</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.470" end="01:07:11.400" style="s2">lineage it says you&#39;re supposed to get</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.480" end="01:07:13.380" style="s2">smarter and wiser the more you get</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.400" end="01:07:15.030" style="s2">educated but that&#39;s not the case that a</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.380" end="01:07:16.800" style="s2">lot of artists not education artists</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.030" end="01:07:19.110" style="s2">just transforming himself the trickster</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.800" end="01:07:20.640" style="s2">is an artist I mean you throw something</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.110" end="01:07:22.730" style="s2">into the Machine and you don&#39;t take your</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.640" end="01:07:26.460" style="s2">responsibility for it but it&#39;s artistic</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.730" end="01:07:29.700" style="s2">look I mean again this is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.460" end="01:07:34.080" style="s2">struggling because I see poesis and</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.700" end="01:07:38.780" style="s2">again you know clearly connections to</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.080" end="01:07:41.220" style="s2">Heidegger a lot of people you know that</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.780" end="01:07:43.830" style="s2">police&#39;s it is actually bringing things</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.220" end="01:07:45.480" style="s2">into intelligibility it police&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.830" end="01:07:47.700" style="s2">originally means okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.480" end="01:07:49.950" style="s2">okay now again yeah I think this is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.700" end="01:07:51.840" style="s2">crux if I may say so of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.950" end="01:07:53.430" style="s2">disagreement or no no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.840" end="01:07:56.820" style="s2">disagreement oh they&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.430" end="01:07:58.710" style="s2">disagreement but but in my work I call</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.820" end="01:08:00.570" style="s2">the path of poesis and I call it mytho</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.710" end="01:08:02.460" style="s2">polices and I call the logo play these</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.570" end="01:08:04.320" style="s2">voices so yes I agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.460" end="01:08:13.320" style="s2">description now I get it yeah Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.320" end="01:08:15.660" style="s2">yeah I thought really suggesting John</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.320" end="01:08:21.569" style="s2">what&#39;swhat&#39;s where&#39;s your resistance</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.660" end="01:08:24.839" style="s2">here my resistance it was that I well I</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.569" end="01:08:29.700" style="s2">was seeing art I was thinking of poetry</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.839" end="01:08:31.560" style="s2">as an as an essential form that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.700" end="01:08:33.779" style="s2">because Police&#39;s originally didn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.560" end="01:08:35.730" style="s2">just what we call poetry it was extended</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.779" end="01:08:37.830" style="s2">to mean a lot of what we call it Paul</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.730" end="01:08:39.210" style="s2">Hart today so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.830" end="01:08:40.770" style="s2">something that&#39;s a historical I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.210" end="01:08:42.839" style="s2">I&#39;m actually making reference to</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.770" end="01:08:44.699" style="s2">something and Alexander&#39;s not in sight</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.839" end="01:08:47.250" style="s2">agrees with that it&#39;s the etymological</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.699" end="01:08:50.730" style="s2">history and I see police&#39;s has very much</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.250" end="01:08:52.589" style="s2">like insight it&#39;s basically making sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.730" end="01:08:55.830" style="s2">it&#39;s generating new ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.589" end="01:08:58.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;m really wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.830" end="01:09:00.270" style="s2">like making sense not just in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.080" end="01:09:02.849" style="s2">everyday sense with making new ways of</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.270" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">making sense possible to us I think that</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.849" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">is one of the front and I see that as</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:10.049" style="s2">part of what I would typically call</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:13.139" style="s2">logos because that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.049" end="01:09:15.089" style="s2">Heraclitus sees it as the thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.139" end="01:09:18.029" style="s2">made we usually think of logos as</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.089" end="01:09:19.770" style="s2">language right and wears in poetry goes</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.029" end="01:09:22.859" style="s2">beyond language there&#39;s dance there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.770" end="01:09:24.599" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s energy even in our</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.859" end="01:09:27.480" style="s2">English words it doesn&#39;t stand for just</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.599" end="01:09:29.639" style="s2">language ontology the logos of the on</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.480" end="01:09:30.889" style="s2">top that doesn&#39;t I mean when I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.639" end="01:09:35.279" style="s2">ontological</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.889" end="01:09:37.349" style="s2">record about the structures of being and</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.279" end="01:09:39.779" style="s2">the intelligent that&#39;s why we sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.349" end="01:09:41.489" style="s2">translated not by speech we translate it</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.779" end="01:09:43.920" style="s2">also poorly but a little bit better than</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.489" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">speech with study because study is</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.920" end="01:09:48.509" style="s2">supposed to be this idea of conforming</p>

<p begin="01:09:53.400" end="01:09:58.260" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing archaeology right and</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.679" end="01:10:00.480" style="s2">so I think logos again has a much more</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.260" end="01:10:03.170" style="s2">comprehensive notion and the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:07.530" style="s2">this is important to me is because I</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.170" end="01:10:10.380" style="s2">well I want to extend and under I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.530" end="01:10:12.210" style="s2">made this argument to you and I&#39;m going</p>

<p begin="01:10:35.480" end="01:10:41.730" style="s2">we have tended to turn reason into</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.550" end="01:10:44.670" style="s2">something well to use Alexander&#39;s from</p>

<p begin="01:11:01.220" end="01:11:05.240" style="s2">from Alexander is is you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.810" end="01:11:08.360" style="s2">artists beyond good and evil in some</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.240" end="01:11:10.490" style="s2">sense right beyond yeah and I&#39;m saying I</p>

<p begin="01:11:10.490" end="01:11:16.130" style="s2">John is saying that that art has some</p>

<p begin="01:11:16.130" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">and all these you know okay that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.770" end="01:11:28.970" style="s2">I disagree as Suzanne is that am I</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:33.260" style="s2">correct in understanding to represent me</p>

<p begin="01:11:33.260" end="01:11:36.350" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying I want to make sure you</p>

<p begin="01:11:36.350" end="01:11:39.920" style="s2">understood me</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.490" end="01:11:43.040" style="s2">okay I&#39;m not claiming I&#39;m not claiming</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.920" end="01:11:45.800" style="s2">that all art is that I&#39;m claiming that</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.040" end="01:11:47.200" style="s2">there seems to be an important branch</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.800" end="01:11:51.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s the point of the etymological</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.200" end="01:11:54.050" style="s2">argument all are the poesis that is what</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.020" end="01:11:57.530" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about that that part of</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.050" end="01:11:59.270" style="s2">wisdom is to realize in the deep sense</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.530" end="01:12:01.430" style="s2">what hasn&#39;t been realized for seen</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.270" end="01:12:03.950" style="s2">before and that is what police Asst</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.430" end="01:12:06.740" style="s2">affords us to do it allows us to see</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.950" end="01:12:08.720" style="s2">things and realize patterns we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.740" end="01:12:11.720" style="s2">see before that&#39;s the making and I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.720" end="01:12:13.550" style="s2">that&#39;s a central concern of you</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.720" end="01:12:15.890" style="s2">that&#39;s why so much wisdom literature is</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.550" end="01:12:19.370" style="s2">written poetically and it&#39;s not written</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.890" end="01:12:21.170" style="s2">propositional like I got it I agree I</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.370" end="01:12:24.830" style="s2">agree that&#39;s that&#39;s why I talked about</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.170" end="01:12:26.270" style="s2">the three narratives so you can&#39;t be why</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.830" end="01:12:27.770" style="s2">so that the three narratives and</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.270" end="01:12:29.030" style="s2">understanding the world from the three</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.770" end="01:12:30.530" style="s2">narratives you can&#39;t just have one of</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.030" end="01:12:32.390" style="s2">them that&#39;s you see they are it you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.530" end="01:12:34.130" style="s2">have to have all three and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.390" end="01:12:35.900" style="s2">harmonious in between each other to keep</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.130" end="01:12:37.160" style="s2">you in like constantly questioning</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.900" end="01:12:39.380" style="s2">everything which is of course what</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.160" end="01:12:42.320" style="s2">creativity starts so I agree on that</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.380" end="01:12:44.590" style="s2">the only thing is that to me we have to</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.320" end="01:12:46.940" style="s2">go back to what I&#39;m lacking in</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.590" end="01:12:49.460" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s that he doesn&#39;t have a split</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.940" end="01:12:51.170" style="s2">in the in the donation and this is where</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.460" end="01:12:52.730" style="s2">this idea that sander proposed that I</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.170" end="01:12:54.440" style="s2">want to have art would be on good and</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.730" end="01:12:57.080" style="s2">evil because I think it gets banal if it</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.440" end="01:12:59.090" style="s2">isn&#39;t beyond good and evil it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.080" end="01:13:00.500" style="s2">like raw material or something in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.090" end="01:13:02.870" style="s2">human soul rather than it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.500" end="01:13:05.870" style="s2">completion or anything shakes us up but</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.870" end="01:13:08.360" style="s2">the Dionysian I don&#39;t find in nature</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.870" end="01:13:09.409" style="s2">that nature separates the donation so if</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.360" end="01:13:10.610" style="s2">you say Tantra</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.409" end="01:13:13.760" style="s2">traffic sent but there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.610" end="01:13:16.849" style="s2">difference here so the Dionysian lynch</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.760" end="01:13:18.889" style="s2">mob which were experiencing today these</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.849" end="01:13:20.719" style="s2">days you see the otic and really</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.889" end="01:13:23.059" style="s2">dangerous in history because the initial</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.719" end="01:13:25.489" style="s2">is pump is basically mimicking mimicking</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.059" end="01:13:26.929" style="s2">mimicking scared like hell running</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.489" end="01:13:29.030" style="s2">through the streets and trying to find a</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.929" end="01:13:31.219" style="s2">scapegoat to kill but the other</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.030" end="01:13:32.539" style="s2">dimension is to crazy wisdom ass but</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.219" end="01:13:37.010" style="s2">through the dine you see that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.539" end="01:13:39.559" style="s2">gets yeah this is a shame as an artist</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.010" end="01:13:42.019" style="s2">go for inspiration and what they do they</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.559" end="01:13:43.400" style="s2">make all these connotations and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.019" end="01:13:45.079" style="s2">and take psychedelics and stuff and come</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.400" end="01:13:47.090" style="s2">back and nine IDs out of town are just</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.079" end="01:13:50.059" style="s2">terribly bad but the tenth one is just</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.090" end="01:13:52.309" style="s2">wow we&#39;ve never seen the world through</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.059" end="01:13:54.139" style="s2">that perspective before and that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.309" end="01:13:56.179" style="s2">transformative art and I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.139" end="01:13:58.130" style="s2">any artists today and I know tons of</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.179" end="01:14:00.469" style="s2">them and I don&#39;t notice today who would</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.130" end="01:14:02.929" style="s2">like to have art prior to good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.469" end="01:14:04.820" style="s2">again she&#39;s like we are Beyond Good and</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.929" end="01:14:08.499" style="s2">Evil and certainly are in the east</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.820" end="01:14:08.499" style="s2">certainly what was always billing good</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.969" end="01:14:19.969" style="s2">and originally for shaman needs to see</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.469" end="01:14:23.300" style="s2">right knowing by seeing so and you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.969" end="01:14:25.999" style="s2">and wizards and Wise Ones are you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.300" end="01:14:28.820" style="s2">the heritage is in shamanism and so what</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.999" end="01:14:30.800" style="s2">I think I hear you saying is I talked</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.820" end="01:14:32.449" style="s2">about this and this is also in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.800" end="01:14:35.570" style="s2">cognitive science of insight you need</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.449" end="01:14:37.400" style="s2">disruptive strategies right in order to</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.570" end="01:14:40.760" style="s2">have an insight you need something that</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.400" end="01:14:43.610" style="s2">you like what psychedelics do is they</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.760" end="01:14:46.489" style="s2">basically throw cybernetic noise into</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.610" end="01:14:48.709" style="s2">the brain and that disrupts patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.489" end="01:14:50.780" style="s2">allows new patterns to emerge which i</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.709" end="01:14:54.559" style="s2">think is one way of understanding the</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.780" end="01:14:56.780" style="s2">Dionysian and and of course shamans who</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.559" end="01:14:58.489" style="s2">use of course psychedelics they use all</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.780" end="01:15:01.459" style="s2">kinds of disruptive strategies sleep</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.489" end="01:15:04.610" style="s2">deprivation sex deprivation solitude etc</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.459" end="01:15:06.380" style="s2">in order to do this and I could you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.610" end="01:15:08.119" style="s2">do it even in a much more mundane clash</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.380" end="01:15:10.010" style="s2">and I&#39;ll give you an insight problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.119" end="01:15:12.169" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to solve on a computer</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.010" end="01:15:13.789" style="s2">screen and you can&#39;t solve it and then I</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.169" end="01:15:15.079" style="s2">throw some static into the screen and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.789" end="01:15:16.369" style="s2">make it jiggle around and then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.079" end="01:15:18.409" style="s2">have an insight because you have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.369" end="01:15:20.899" style="s2">break frame in order to make frank if</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.409" end="01:15:22.080" style="s2">that if that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about</p>

<p begin="01:15:22.080" end="01:15:27.480" style="s2">that disruptive strategy that is outside</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.190" end="01:15:30.450" style="s2">of the frame because it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.480" end="01:15:32.220" style="s2">disruptive if it&#39;s inside the frame is</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.450" end="01:15:33.690" style="s2">that what you mean by beyond good and</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.220" end="01:15:36.270" style="s2">evil that it&#39;s something outside of our</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.690" end="01:15:38.580" style="s2">framing that disrupts our framing but</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.270" end="01:15:41.430" style="s2">affords a reframing a trans framing of</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.580" end="01:15:43.950" style="s2">some kind oh yeah it is the natural</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.430" end="01:15:45.600" style="s2">event for example he&#39;s just that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:15:54.080" end="01:15:59.940" style="s2">pathos is we&#39;re basically living in</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.880" end="01:16:02.840" style="s2">fantasies according to Lacan but only</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.370" end="01:16:12.660" style="s2">fantasy we suddenly had to redefine the</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.290" end="01:16:14.940" style="s2">world and we realize it&#39;s chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.660" end="01:16:17.430" style="s2">there&#39;s no order to it so the order was</p>

<p begin="01:16:20.850" end="01:16:25.230" style="s2">and we were reminded of that concept</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.160" end="01:16:27.240" style="s2">this is pathos but this is also means</p>

<p begin="01:20:09.490" end="01:20:14.800" style="s2">what you&#39;re proposing but I also agree</p>

<p begin="01:20:14.800" end="01:20:18.910" style="s2">tongue-in-cheek if we if we create if we</p>

<p begin="01:20:58.270" end="01:21:02.290" style="s2">I mean his whole new way of seeing it</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.710" end="01:21:04.360" style="s2">was an attempt to integrate that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.290" end="01:21:06.880" style="s2">convocation of insight and the shamanic</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.360" end="01:21:07.180" style="s2">back into logos the whole work that he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:21:07.180" end="01:21:10.900" style="s2">you know criticizing Newton&#39;s color</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.710" end="01:21:13.720" style="s2">theory his work on you know the the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.900" end="01:21:16.390" style="s2">herb plant right and what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.720" end="01:21:19.030" style="s2">about that is you know when niche amici</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.390" end="01:21:20.770" style="s2">offers very few actual examples of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.030" end="01:21:24.760" style="s2">ubermensch but he clearly pronounced as</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.770" end="01:21:26.710" style="s2">Goethe as an example of the do you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.760" end="01:21:29.760" style="s2">what Patrick Ryan is going to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.710" end="01:21:32.860" style="s2">gonna rewrite the history of alchemy oh</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.760" end="01:21:33.520" style="s2">is that a wonderful yeah yeah that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.860" end="01:21:35.650" style="s2">brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.520" end="01:21:39.130" style="s2">I think it&#39;s brilliant Edison Todd is</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.650" end="01:21:41.350" style="s2">doing some similar work on is and so I I</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.130" end="01:21:44.560" style="s2">think I&#39;m very interested in good too in</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.350" end="01:21:48.070" style="s2">the new way of seeing because it seems</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.560" end="01:21:50.380" style="s2">to me to be integrating a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.070" end="01:21:52.540" style="s2">we&#39;re talking to get about and I see him</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.380" end="01:21:54.430" style="s2">as somebody just like Spinoza is</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.540" end="01:21:56.800" style="s2">responding to Descartes and the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.430" end="01:21:58.240" style="s2">crisis and I gotta get more into this I</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.800" end="01:21:59.980" style="s2">see good to as responding because he</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.240" end="01:22:01.949" style="s2">does he&#39;s reading cost and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.980" end="01:22:04.500" style="s2">ultimately rejected cost and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.949" end="01:22:06.570" style="s2">as they form a a pair like you had there</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.500" end="01:22:09.210" style="s2">always considered the two together and</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.570" end="01:22:14.699" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting that that would what</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.210" end="01:22:16.890" style="s2">that good to has that good to claims so</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.699" end="01:22:17.850" style="s2">this is a this is meant as it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.890" end="01:22:19.440" style="s2">friendly challenge you</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.850" end="01:22:22.830" style="s2">he claims that an integration between</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.440" end="01:22:25.770" style="s2">them is possible and Nietzsche seemed to</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.830" end="01:22:27.660" style="s2">agree with him that he had achieved that</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.770" end="01:22:29.429" style="s2">kind of integration between the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.660" end="01:22:32.040" style="s2">Apollonian and the Dionysian and both</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.429" end="01:22:34.260" style="s2">sides of the Dionysian to because of</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.040" end="01:22:35.730" style="s2">course good to is tremendously familiar</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.260" end="01:22:37.290" style="s2">with the shadow we see this all the way</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.730" end="01:22:39.179" style="s2">through flowers yeah so he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.290" end="01:22:40.860" style="s2">tremendously aware of the shadow but</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.179" end="01:22:42.360" style="s2">he&#39;s also aware of this other side of</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.860" end="01:22:44.070" style="s2">the Dionysian that you&#39;re pointing to</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.360" end="01:22:46.350" style="s2">because you could see it in his work on</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.070" end="01:22:48.870" style="s2">on the optics and on the on the on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.350" end="01:22:51.840" style="s2">biology and yet he see he claimed that</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.870" end="01:22:55.050" style="s2">he&#39;s able to integrate that with you</p>

<p begin="01:22:55.050" end="01:22:59.489" style="s2">his writing so what you think about the</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.360" end="01:23:02.429" style="s2">possibility of integration because you</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.489" end="01:23:04.170" style="s2">said I&#39;m not this is this is another way</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.429" end="01:23:06.960" style="s2">Alexander I&#39;m asking my tricky question</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.170" end="01:23:09.239" style="s2">of how do we get how do we get without</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.960" end="01:23:11.010" style="s2">giving any one of these primacy how do</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.239" end="01:23:14.940" style="s2">we get the monism the integration</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.010" end="01:23:16.710" style="s2">without a reduction yes cut them up into</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.940" end="01:23:19.679" style="s2">emergence vectors I try to keep them</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.710" end="01:23:21.960" style="s2">separate but there is that where it goes</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.679" end="01:23:24.350" style="s2">yeah but but the point is there in</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.960" end="01:23:26.400" style="s2">recording that&#39;s the thing they see</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.350" end="01:23:28.320" style="s2">gravity in the low kinds of shit that</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.400" end="01:23:30.150" style="s2">actually affects them and everything is</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.320" end="01:23:32.730" style="s2">affecting everything else but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.150" end="01:23:34.710" style="s2">the same I say well no no no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.730" end="01:23:36.210" style="s2">claiming that&#39;s exactly right I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.710" end="01:23:38.580" style="s2">claiming reduction I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.210" end="01:23:40.949" style="s2">they&#39;re all this or they&#39;re all this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.580" end="01:23:44.100" style="s2">trying to get is there an alternative</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.949" end="01:23:46.110" style="s2">sense I mean I see Whitehead is fumbling</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.100" end="01:23:47.940" style="s2">for this I mean that&#39;s what he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.110" end="01:23:51.500" style="s2">to do with his idea of God he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.940" end="01:23:55.290" style="s2">to struggle with how do I have true</p>

<p begin="01:23:55.290" end="01:23:59.550" style="s2">intelligibility and yet a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.690" end="01:24:02.070" style="s2">integrated monism because he ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.550" end="01:24:03.840" style="s2">had he was trying to he was definitely</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.070" end="01:24:06.510" style="s2">trying to integrate the emergence and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.840" end="01:24:08.850" style="s2">the emanation together that&#39;s clear in</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.510" end="01:24:11.429" style="s2">what he&#39;s trying to do and so this this</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.850" end="01:24:14.210" style="s2">is the thing that oh I saw that I saw</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.429" end="01:24:14.210" style="s2">that one physics</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.599" end="01:24:19.909" style="s2">to time-dimension see in my work so</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.760" end="01:24:21.619" style="s2">there&#39;s time in Hypertime and actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.909" end="01:24:23.179" style="s2">now the physicists are getting very</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.619" end="01:24:24.980" style="s2">interested because they discovered that</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.179" end="01:24:27.320" style="s2">the Big Bounce happened and of the Big</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.980" end="01:24:29.750" style="s2">Bang so there was a prior universe that</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.320" end="01:24:32.719" style="s2">collapsed and his space-time happens</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.750" end="01:24:34.010" style="s2">after the Big Bounce that means there</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.719" end="01:24:35.989" style="s2">must be another time dimension in</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.010" end="01:24:37.849" style="s2">Hypertime so Ron didn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.989" end="01:24:39.079" style="s2">hyperspace like at written Dustin is</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.849" end="01:24:42.440" style="s2">physics I&#39;m much more interested in</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.079" end="01:24:43.880" style="s2">Hypertime and and again we can think the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.440" end="01:24:46.760" style="s2">world without space we can&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.880" end="01:24:49.369" style="s2">world without time but that means it</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.760" end="01:24:51.980" style="s2">opens up the possibility the dam China</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.369" end="01:24:54.560" style="s2">is in India right along the time</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.980" end="01:24:56.810" style="s2">ultimate list Hypertime has a circular</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.560" end="01:24:58.400" style="s2">characteristic to it and linear time on</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.810" end="01:25:00.829" style="s2">the curse after something like Big Bang</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:07.070" style="s2">you know sound like latinas through and</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.829" end="01:25:08.989" style="s2">through like I was gonna say circle of</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.070" end="01:25:12.790" style="s2">eternity right and the one is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.989" end="01:25:16.849" style="s2">singularity beyond maybe Alexander&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.790" end="01:25:19.190" style="s2">dislike of platonic idealism is is</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.849" end="01:25:24.560" style="s2">because he&#39;s so intimate with it on some</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.190" end="01:25:26.929" style="s2">level it&#39;s like no no patroness I just</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.560" end="01:25:30.560" style="s2">I&#39;m with Aristotle&#39;s accusations against</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.929" end="01:25:33.110" style="s2">Plato except that I&#39;m a Harrington so</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.560" end="01:25:35.329" style="s2">Heraclitus is my Greek okay he was</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.110" end="01:25:36.800" style="s2">occured he was Iranian so obviously he</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.329" end="01:25:41.389" style="s2">introduced or asked him thinking to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.800" end="01:25:42.949" style="s2">Greece how can you not it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.389" end="01:25:44.360" style="s2">and he comes up with logos and it comes</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.949" end="01:25:46.489" style="s2">from dialectics and all these things -</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.360" end="01:25:50.360" style="s2">and but no they&#39;re the fragments right</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.489" end="01:25:52.190" style="s2">so but you know I see Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.360" end="01:25:53.750" style="s2">equations against Plato is very</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.190" end="01:25:55.159" style="s2">warranted and then of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.750" end="01:25:56.570" style="s2">talking mimics the Persians and conquer</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.159" end="01:25:58.400" style="s2">the Persian Empire without it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.570" end="01:26:01.130" style="s2">great right after that which is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.400" end="01:26:03.170" style="s2">right certainly priests if anybody with</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.130" end="01:26:05.900" style="s2">the chief tape but I think plots on us</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.170" end="01:26:08.570" style="s2">and the neoplatonist RC key here because</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.900" end="01:26:11.000" style="s2">to me at least historically to get out</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.570" end="01:26:12.800" style="s2">of the dualism trap and definitely go</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.000" end="01:26:19.719" style="s2">for the Manas worldview which is where I</p>
