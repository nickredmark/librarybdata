<p begin="00:01:29.460" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">the first time I&#39;ve had to endure a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">biography and quite some time apologies</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">for the I never know how much detail to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:43.170" style="s2">go into so so Jordan you have in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">ways a pretty dismal prediction for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.170" end="00:01:48.030" style="s2">future of humanity but but you also see</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">a potential for an optimistic outcome</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">can you tell us a bit about that which</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">part well why don&#39;t we start about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">dismal prediction well so I guess since</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">this we&#39;re talking to this particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">group in the particular way it seems I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">think right to begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">proposition of being non-attachment well</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">I have a I have a sense of what are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">most likely future states on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:18.630" style="s2">various trajectories that were on and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:23.970" style="s2">does seem to be the case that if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.630" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">were to take a most people would not</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.970" end="00:02:28.020" style="s2">like oysters and we&#39;re liking fractions</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a good way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.020" end="00:02:35.370" style="s2">the vast majority of people alive today</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:39.030" style="s2">I suspect would be what we would prefer</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.370" end="00:02:43.140" style="s2">most of the most likely or trajectories</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.030" end="00:02:45.330" style="s2">not be the ones that occur though then</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.140" end="00:02:46.980" style="s2">this one question is why why would I say</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.330" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">that&#39;s the case was the the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.980" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">that proposition then as you say it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:52.370" style="s2">the other thing which is say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.370" end="00:02:59.100" style="s2">scenarios that I livre are why couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:00.690" style="s2">happen and what&#39;s the the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">them happening and then finally agency</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.690" end="00:03:06.090" style="s2">what kinds of things might we do to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:07.860" style="s2">able to steer the new so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.090" end="00:03:12.690" style="s2">ending up on the places we would like it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.860" end="00:03:13.709" style="s2">to be the answer to the question of why</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.690" end="00:03:15.600" style="s2">it is that I come to these particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.709" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">conclusions unfortunate it&#39;s not simple</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.600" end="00:03:22.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s the large body of work</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">including a lot of people many of whom</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.320" end="00:03:26.010" style="s2">were quite obscure when I was working</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">with them and they&#39;re not obscurity</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.010" end="00:03:30.570" style="s2">longer which is an interesting sign that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">they probably but there are these timely</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.570" end="00:03:35.550" style="s2">people if not also timely and capable so</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:38.130" style="s2">we can go into that if you&#39;d like but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.550" end="00:03:40.230" style="s2">the the bigger picture is sort of lots</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.130" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">of people earnestly endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.230" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">engage with what it&#39;s real and thereby</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:49.140" style="s2">recognizing that there are perhaps ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:51.780" style="s2">of modeling the ways that things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.140" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">cultures and civilizations and as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.780" end="00:03:58.680" style="s2">as energetic systems and living systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:04:04.620" style="s2">evolve and leading to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.680" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">that under most circumstances the ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.620" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">that were in right now are headed for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">bad a bad end and then and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:15.320" style="s2">that same theory indicates that all hope</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:19.080" style="s2">is not lost and that in fact there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.320" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">decent chance of not just a kind of okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.080" end="00:04:22.049" style="s2">and put a really good one right so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:24.390" style="s2">guess the key the key message that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.049" end="00:04:25.890" style="s2">like to put out there is that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.390" end="00:04:26.889" style="s2">we do actually have a bit of a fork in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.890" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">the road</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.889" end="00:04:34.060" style="s2">and that most of the ability is based</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:35.409" style="s2">upon our choices not upon the contact</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.060" end="00:04:36.930" style="s2">the causal structure we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.409" end="00:04:40.270" style="s2">it does that make sense that last part</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.930" end="00:04:42.039" style="s2">yeah what you were speaking in a recent</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.270" end="00:04:43.509" style="s2">in your recent voices with Verve ecchi</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.039" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">you spoke with John about the importance</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.509" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">of looking at the shape of a network</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">rather than the content of it and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:52.150" style="s2">call this an important insight and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:53.590" style="s2">think that&#39;s that sounds like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.150" end="00:04:55.979" style="s2">you&#39;re getting getting to hear maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.590" end="00:05:00.759" style="s2">can break it down for us a little more</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.979" end="00:05:03.009" style="s2">mmm okay sure let me do something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.759" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">very timely although I know you guys you</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.009" end="00:05:07.060" style="s2">mentioned that this particular group is</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:09.060" style="s2">more focused on they were the more</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.060" end="00:05:11.409" style="s2">spiritual side than the political side</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.060" end="00:05:13.659" style="s2">we can use the political side to give us</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.409" end="00:05:15.310" style="s2">perspective on certain things so for</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.659" end="00:05:18.939" style="s2">example just as just as a for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.310" end="00:05:21.639" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously a vast topic a thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.939" end="00:05:26.520" style="s2">that&#39;s happening right now in the United</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.639" end="00:05:31.960" style="s2">States in terms of the breakdown of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.520" end="00:05:34.680" style="s2">rupture of the ink called policing on my</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.960" end="00:05:38.620" style="s2">point of view is of a sort instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.680" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">of a kind that is similar to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.620" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">breakdowns of lots of other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:44.439" style="s2">things and therefore in sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:46.270" style="s2">quite predictable but that this</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.439" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">particular thing would break down at</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.270" end="00:05:50.889" style="s2">this time at this local intensity is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:53.500" style="s2">quite as easy to predict we&#39;ve said okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.889" end="00:05:55.419" style="s2">here&#39;s a box of 50 things one of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.500" end="00:05:56.919" style="s2">foreshore is gonna break that and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.419" end="00:05:58.089" style="s2">breakdown will look like this and by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.919" end="00:06:00.789" style="s2">way it will be followed by these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.089" end="00:06:05.259" style="s2">of things that&#39;s much more doable so for</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.789" end="00:06:09.629" style="s2">example the kind of network design that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.259" end="00:06:12.069" style="s2">is associated with policing has a oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.629" end="00:06:14.529" style="s2">it&#39;s funny like Foucault was actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.069" end="00:06:16.629" style="s2">the guy who regionally began to and to</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.529" end="00:06:18.099" style="s2">analyze this which had to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.629" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">for example in the notion that the role</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.099" end="00:06:23.830" style="s2">of policeman is a formal concept and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:25.149" style="s2">that there is a governance mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.830" end="00:06:26.699" style="s2">which lives outside of the role of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.149" end="00:06:30.460" style="s2">policeman lives in a different domain</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.699" end="00:06:32.050" style="s2">that governance mechanism defines and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.460" end="00:06:34.270" style="s2">designs what is the content of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.050" end="00:06:35.860" style="s2">former world policeman separately</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.270" end="00:06:38.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a governance mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.860" end="00:06:39.599" style="s2">collects individual actual human beings</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.919" end="00:06:42.169" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.599" end="00:06:44.129" style="s2">puts them into that particular category</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.169" end="00:06:46.499" style="s2">in particular way it&#39;s wise you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.129" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">this the system dynamic that has certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.499" end="00:06:51.479" style="s2">kinds of characteristics of how it</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.659" end="00:07:08.999" style="s2">you can take a look at the formality and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.610" end="00:07:11.699" style="s2">say okay this formal system has for</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.999" end="00:07:13.169" style="s2">example it has a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.699" end="00:07:14.819" style="s2">complexity that it can manage and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.169" end="00:07:17.219" style="s2">therefore is going to have a built-in</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.819" end="00:07:20.509" style="s2">error rate and it&#39;s going to have a</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.509" end="00:07:25.409" style="s2">environment is changing faster than some</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.279" end="00:07:27.539" style="s2">number some add some quantitative change</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.409" end="00:07:28.979" style="s2">this particular control system won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.539" end="00:07:33.180" style="s2">able to keep up and it&#39;ll actually go</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.979" end="00:07:36.209" style="s2">into a breakdown in control for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.180" end="00:07:38.099" style="s2">if it&#39;s a whole giant piece of kind of</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.099" end="00:07:44.519" style="s2">network theory to take a look at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.050" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">particular concrete event so running in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.519" end="00:07:50.789" style="s2">a very intellectual level policeman</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:54.949" style="s2">spiritual we could say that the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.789" end="00:07:58.050" style="s2">network design that we have as a certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.949" end="00:08:00.209" style="s2">fate to it at the certain other things</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.050" end="00:08:02.069" style="s2">that are a what it&#39;s can do and what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.209" end="00:08:03.479" style="s2">be what it can&#39;t do and then the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.069" end="00:08:07.289" style="s2">things which are going to be its natural</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.479" end="00:08:09.089" style="s2">tendencies and its natural tendencies in</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.289" end="00:08:10.379" style="s2">certain contexts but then we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.089" end="00:08:12.089" style="s2">take a look at what are the context that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.379" end="00:08:13.769" style="s2">you&#39;re putting a network design in you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.089" end="00:08:16.589" style="s2">have a much richer sense of what are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.769" end="00:08:22.979" style="s2">likely ways of that larger systems going</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.589" end="00:08:24.689" style="s2">to evolve that felt too theoretical and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.979" end="00:08:26.759" style="s2">abstract which may be a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.689" end="00:08:29.129" style="s2">grounding it well well what if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.759" end="00:08:31.169" style="s2">grounded in in a community community</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.129" end="00:08:33.509" style="s2">like ours you know we&#39;re this is a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.169" end="00:08:35.370" style="s2">community where we&#39;ve just formed in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.509" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">really the last two months we&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.370" end="00:08:41.009" style="s2">at our two-month anniversary you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:44.069" style="s2">how would how would you recommend for</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.009" end="00:08:46.649" style="s2">example we what what should we be</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.069" end="00:08:48.660" style="s2">thinking of in in setting up you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.649" end="00:08:51.059" style="s2">our network we&#39;re in the middle you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.660" end="00:08:52.390" style="s2">of crafting roles and responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.059" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">and you know different roles</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.390" end="00:08:55.960" style="s2">people are are taking within the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:08:58.030" style="s2">community of some some will be</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.960" end="00:08:59.620" style="s2">organizing events other people will be</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.030" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">you know you know maybe leading</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.620" end="00:09:05.590" style="s2">meditations or or other type of sessions</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:07.210" style="s2">others will be working on structure you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.590" end="00:09:13.300" style="s2">know what what what can we take from</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.210" end="00:09:15.060" style="s2">your work to help direct us ok so</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.300" end="00:09:19.330" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a whole lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.060" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">well let&#39;s begin with I&#39;m gonna put in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.330" end="00:09:24.400" style="s2">form of recommendations as opposed in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.130" end="00:09:26.410" style="s2">the form of options because the option</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.400" end="00:09:28.270" style="s2">space is quite large in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.410" end="00:09:32.980" style="s2">recommendations some things that I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.270" end="00:09:35.110" style="s2">point out are a network design one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.980" end="00:09:37.890" style="s2">the variables you can look at is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.110" end="00:09:40.210" style="s2">degree to which a particular node and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.890" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">domain which is to say a cluster of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.210" end="00:09:47.380" style="s2">nodes is specialized or generalized and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:49.990" style="s2">so a for example in the military you</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.380" end="00:09:52.810" style="s2">tend to have high levels of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.990" end="00:09:55.810" style="s2">specialization in in for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.810" end="00:09:57.490" style="s2">decision making and so the major</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.810" end="00:09:59.890" style="s2">function in Army has a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.490" end="00:10:01.390" style="s2">domain and scope of decision making and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.890" end="00:10:03.220" style="s2">it&#39;s very very important that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.390" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">particular node know when a decision</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.220" end="00:10:08.110" style="s2">with is in its scope if it&#39;s too big it</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:10.090" style="s2">has to go up and cuz too little has to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.110" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">go down like that kind of structure and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.090" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">notice what happens there is that once</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:18.010" style="s2">you&#39;ve made a couple of commitments to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:19.510" style="s2">hire designing your network a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.010" end="00:10:21.850" style="s2">other stuff comes with it right so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.510" end="00:10:25.770" style="s2">you design a network that is of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.850" end="00:10:28.630" style="s2">of the post-world War two military then</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.770" end="00:10:30.430" style="s2">if you want to be effective at all a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.630" end="00:10:31.960" style="s2">of energy a lot of attention a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.430" end="00:10:33.460" style="s2">the capacity of even individuals</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.960" end="00:10:36.610" style="s2">actually has to be focused on questions</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.460" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">like is this particular area of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.610" end="00:10:40.960" style="s2">something that is right for my level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:43.900" style="s2">authority or should I push it down or</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.960" end="00:10:45.220" style="s2">should I send it up so you mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.900" end="00:10:46.840" style="s2">been planning on that as being part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.220" end="00:10:49.000" style="s2">what the time you&#39;re spending people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.840" end="00:10:51.070" style="s2">time on but ultimately it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.000" end="00:10:52.750" style="s2">you have to and so it gets smuggled in</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.070" end="00:10:55.210" style="s2">and that&#39;s a I think exceeding that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.750" end="00:10:57.640" style="s2">people miss a lot is that the there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.210" end="00:10:59.320" style="s2">actually some natural network design</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.640" end="00:11:02.140" style="s2">clusters that once you&#39;ve made a few</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.320" end="00:11:04.180" style="s2">choices a lot of other things follow now</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.140" end="00:11:06.340" style="s2">in the context of what you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.180" end="00:11:11.530" style="s2">doing what my sense is that there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.340" end="00:11:13.030" style="s2">of or three things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.530" end="00:11:14.370" style="s2">simultaneously there may be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.030" end="00:11:17.410" style="s2">of tension that may be a healthy tension</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.370" end="00:11:19.800" style="s2">so on the one hand I&#39;ve mentioned I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.410" end="00:11:22.630" style="s2">heard you mention the word community and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.800" end="00:11:24.280" style="s2">it feels to me like in the tone of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.630" end="00:11:27.730" style="s2">voice when you say it that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.280" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">mean that in the sense of community like</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.730" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">a group of people who sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:39.940" style="s2">togetherness or wholeness and being</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:44.100" style="s2">together yes maybe in the monastic sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.940" end="00:11:48.540" style="s2">more than in the village sense but you</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.100" end="00:11:51.190" style="s2">all in in directional in that way</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.540" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">equally there seems to be a sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.190" end="00:11:55.300" style="s2">horizon-- despot some sort of mission or</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:59.470" style="s2">objective or purpose more than just</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.300" end="00:12:02.890" style="s2">shared values but interestingly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.470" end="00:12:04.690" style="s2">oriented towards something which is how</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.890" end="00:12:06.550" style="s2">would I say this singular in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.690" end="00:12:07.960" style="s2">domain of purpose which to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.550" end="00:12:10.150" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion for</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.960" end="00:12:13.120" style="s2">example in that document it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.150" end="00:12:15.310" style="s2">that maybe a particular area of interest</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">and as you said the ax meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.310" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">right through is a not just a calling</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:20.680" style="s2">that there&#39;s a gap people or gathered</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:23.350" style="s2">into this community as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.680" end="00:12:25.990" style="s2">consequence of the bail that John is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.350" end="00:12:30.400" style="s2">rung but also there seems to be an</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.990" end="00:12:31.570" style="s2">awareness or intent to focus in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.400" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">direction of that column so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.570" end="00:12:34.840" style="s2">like hey we all gather for the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.040" end="00:12:38.350" style="s2">crisis but now that it&#39;s just can become</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.840" end="00:12:39.730" style="s2">a barbeque but actually a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.350" end="00:12:41.620" style="s2">there&#39;s something about this column that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.730" end="00:12:43.990" style="s2">has meaningfulness to it no pun intended</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.620" end="00:12:50.950" style="s2">and therefore should have a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.990" end="00:12:52.510" style="s2">or so again that kind of that pulls more</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.950" end="00:12:54.460" style="s2">in the direction of a monastic community</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.510" end="00:13:00.640" style="s2">in less than the direction of a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.460" end="00:13:02.490" style="s2">general purpose where people live if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.640" end="00:13:04.600" style="s2">know if you look at the topology of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.490" end="00:13:05.620" style="s2">monastic communities it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.600" end="00:13:06.940" style="s2">interesting because there is it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.620" end="00:13:09.640" style="s2">a real distinction you know villages</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.940" end="00:13:11.230" style="s2">have a different actual topology and my</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.640" end="00:13:12.580" style="s2">necessity than</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.230" end="00:13:14.770" style="s2">monastic communities and the nasty</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.580" end="00:13:17.080" style="s2">community has to have more formal</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.770" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">structure it actually has to have levels</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.080" end="00:13:20.220" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:23.910" style="s2">certain roles that people play and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.220" end="00:13:26.010" style="s2">of rituals that keep discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.910" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">attention while still maintaining the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.010" end="00:13:31.050" style="s2">real integrity of community I think many</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">monks who I know you like the level of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.050" end="00:13:35.010" style="s2">live human relationship and community</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:02.130" style="s2">like how our identities have our</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.670" end="00:15:25.200" style="s2">possible way so that&#39;s another chunk so</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.399" end="00:15:26.970" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of putting in there the toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.200" end="00:15:28.829" style="s2">includes things like ritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.970" end="00:15:32.070" style="s2">intentionally thinking about creating</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.829" end="00:15:35.610" style="s2">rituals largely to increase rigor while</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.070" end="00:15:38.400" style="s2">also increasing ease fulness the second</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.610" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">one would be to be intentional around</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.400" end="00:15:43.650" style="s2">things like playfulness and the felt</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:49.740" style="s2">sense of expression of self into a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.650" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">shared space a third and this is now you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.740" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">know I&#39;m not starting to get a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:56.790" style="s2">bit more fluid is how I said this</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:16:00.060" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a distinction what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.790" end="00:16:03.570" style="s2">would say is between two kinds of design</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.060" end="00:16:06.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a what I might call a preferred</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.570" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">for slander in a mission design or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.500" end="00:16:16.040" style="s2">propositional design the blueprint kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:18.780" style="s2">and a transcendent design or a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.040" end="00:16:21.060" style="s2">oriented design has more of a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.780" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">intuitive or felt sense actually never</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.060" end="00:16:29.430" style="s2">than two of those missions felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:33.000" style="s2">and so I might recommend practices that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.430" end="00:16:37.110" style="s2">orient groups of people who build their</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.000" end="00:16:40.500" style="s2">capacity in gathering a shared felt</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.110" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">sense in themselves enhancing their own</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.500" end="00:16:45.090" style="s2">capacity of their own felt sense and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:47.850" style="s2">then using the individual collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.090" end="00:16:50.460" style="s2">capacity to just serve rightness through</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.850" end="00:16:52.830" style="s2">felt sense as a primary mode of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.460" end="00:16:58.050" style="s2">collective design and decision making in</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.830" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">how the environment progresses and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.050" end="00:17:06.089" style="s2">and devolves that&#39;s more Oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">keep on keep on going up okay no no I do</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.089" end="00:17:11.339" style="s2">not want you to stop keep on going so</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:12.930" style="s2">that so the tumour that come up I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.339" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">actually seeing John in my mind&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.930" end="00:17:17.970" style="s2">now and hearing his voice which I care</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:19.860" style="s2">for her name she&#39;s an influence of both</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.970" end="00:17:25.920" style="s2">John&#39;s and of Dave Snowden&#39;s and what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.860" end="00:17:28.230" style="s2">the sort of primary thinkers in like how</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.920" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">complex systems actually emerge or how</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.230" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">you can design for emergence as to do is</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:33.690" style="s2">sort of enabling constraints and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.430" style="s2">disabling constraints and so thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.690" end="00:17:39.660" style="s2">that way sort of thinking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.430" end="00:17:41.790" style="s2">having a certain necessary octopus&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.660" end="00:17:44.060" style="s2">it is to think about how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.790" end="00:17:45.690" style="s2">identify what are the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.060" end="00:17:47.940" style="s2">enabling constraints</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.690" end="00:17:51.080" style="s2">and disabling constraints to give</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.940" end="00:17:56.100" style="s2">structure while simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.080" end="00:17:57.929" style="s2">engendering the the surprise the insight</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.100" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">and creativity it actually makes it be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.929" end="00:18:02.190" style="s2">felt organic space</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:04.049" style="s2">oh that&#39;s those are some things sorry if</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.190" end="00:18:06.450" style="s2">they&#39;re not there well thought-through</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.049" end="00:18:09.149" style="s2">world no that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s amazing I</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.450" end="00:18:11.340" style="s2">wish it&#39;s part of me what should we just</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.149" end="00:18:13.649" style="s2">spend the whole rest of the time talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.340" end="00:18:16.440" style="s2">about this but but it but it but it is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.649" end="00:18:18.179" style="s2">Q&amp;A and I want to get to to member</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.440" end="00:18:20.100" style="s2">question but thank you so much for that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.179" end="00:18:24.029" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna listen to that several times I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.100" end="00:18:25.620" style="s2">think and after and I was happy to know</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.029" end="00:18:28.049" style="s2">that that some of the things you said I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.620" end="00:18:30.509" style="s2">think are things that we have been been</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.049" end="00:18:33.629" style="s2">doing and we&#39;ve been spending some a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.509" end="00:18:37.500" style="s2">of time recently on unwritten Callie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.629" end="00:18:39.480" style="s2">here in in the Q&amp;A right now and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.500" end="00:18:45.059" style="s2">really been instrumental in helping</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.480" end="00:18:47.100" style="s2">build build rituals and and we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.059" end="00:18:49.379" style="s2">experimenting on different different</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.100" end="00:18:51.720" style="s2">methods and and also the felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.379" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">community of things like lectio Divina</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.720" end="00:18:59.009" style="s2">and and you know authentic relating type</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:19:01.350" style="s2">practices so so a ritual a particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.009" end="00:19:04.590" style="s2">ritual domain that I think doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.350" end="00:19:06.509" style="s2">enough attention particularly in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.590" end="00:19:10.019" style="s2">West like indigenous communities do this</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.509" end="00:19:12.870" style="s2">extraordinarily well and the West tends</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.019" end="00:19:16.759" style="s2">to do this quite poorly have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:20.190" style="s2">rituals associated with membership and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.759" end="00:19:21.960" style="s2">the recognition it&#39;s so funny because</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.190" end="00:19:23.850" style="s2">when I say this in a Western context as</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.960" end="00:19:26.460" style="s2">a I feel like there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.850" end="00:19:27.809" style="s2">contraction but when it&#39;s said in an</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.460" end="00:19:31.350" style="s2">indigenous context are just sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.809" end="00:19:32.970" style="s2">nationalist like oh yes obviously in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.350" end="00:19:34.500" style="s2">month in monastic environments by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.970" end="00:19:36.750" style="s2">way are much more indigenous environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.500" end="00:19:39.750" style="s2">so there&#39;s a a hey guess what there</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.750" end="00:19:41.549" style="s2">really is a distinction between a novice</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.750" end="00:19:43.139" style="s2">and an acolyte and a master and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.549" end="00:19:45.960" style="s2">should be mindful of the reality of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.139" end="00:19:49.879" style="s2">and that a big part of participation in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.960" end="00:19:52.549" style="s2">the community is the the deep the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.879" end="00:19:54.929" style="s2">suffering which is to say the undergoing</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.549" end="00:19:56.429" style="s2">developmental change in self that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.929" end="00:19:58.500" style="s2">associated with the movement through a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.429" end="00:19:59.399" style="s2">series of rituals each one of which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.500" end="00:20:02.119" style="s2">actually a gate</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.399" end="00:20:05.279" style="s2">a portal that really that simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.119" end="00:20:07.859" style="s2">generates changes in self that increase</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.279" end="00:20:09.539" style="s2">your capacity and signifies that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.859" end="00:20:11.369" style="s2">does changes have in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.539" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">occurred which then gives rise to your</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.369" end="00:20:15.570" style="s2">ability to participate in aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:18.929" style="s2">community that may not have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.570" end="00:20:20.999" style="s2">available to you before it was before</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.929" end="00:20:24.659" style="s2">the particular state rituals have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.999" end="00:20:25.950" style="s2">entered undergone though so that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.659" end="00:20:27.359" style="s2">that might actually be a very important</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.950" end="00:20:29.789" style="s2">was hard to do by the way are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.359" end="00:20:30.779" style="s2">event from scratch this is a the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.789" end="00:20:33.179" style="s2">of things that tend to have been the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.779" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">subject of hundreds or thousands and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.179" end="00:20:38.279" style="s2">sometimes tens of thousands of years of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:40.739" style="s2">trial and error in or indigenous or</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.279" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">traditional environments yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.739" end="00:20:46.049" style="s2">trying to to draw on on traditions on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:48.779" style="s2">wide variety of traditions as well as</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.049" end="00:20:51.029" style="s2">maybe but feeling not you know feeling</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.779" end="00:20:53.789" style="s2">that we we have some room to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.029" end="00:20:56.099" style="s2">make them our own in some ways as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.789" end="00:20:58.529" style="s2">what idea we&#39;re playing with is creating</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.099" end="00:21:00.869" style="s2">the role of aspirant which is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.529" end="00:21:01.950" style="s2">you know that that that you know when</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.869" end="00:21:05.339" style="s2">people come into the forum they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.950" end="00:21:06.690" style="s2">automatically named members but you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.339" end="00:21:08.429" style="s2">some people come they come for a day and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.690" end="00:21:10.289" style="s2">they leave other people you know stick</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.429" end="00:21:13.229" style="s2">around but the aspirant would be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.289" end="00:21:15.479" style="s2">a declaration of intention that you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.229" end="00:21:17.190" style="s2">we&#39;re stepping forward where this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.479" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">what we want to do we want to transform</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.190" end="00:21:20.999" style="s2">we want to engage in this community and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:22.889" style="s2">in this process of waking from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.999" end="00:21:24.839" style="s2">meaning crisis and work together and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.889" end="00:21:26.759" style="s2">know participate and so we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.839" end="00:21:29.549" style="s2">working that out now and maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.759" end="00:21:31.049" style="s2">would be a ceremony you know where where</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.549" end="00:21:32.309" style="s2">you would sort of state some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.049" end="00:21:35.009" style="s2">intention and then you would get the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.309" end="00:21:37.080" style="s2">role aspirant and I would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.009" end="00:21:39.239" style="s2">something that has real skin in the game</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.080" end="00:21:41.849" style="s2">and maybe even a level of intensity to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.239" end="00:21:46.049" style="s2">be perfectly frank because then you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.849" end="00:21:47.429" style="s2">load more on that structure and one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.049" end="00:21:48.809" style="s2">the characteristics that is a real</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.429" end="00:21:50.609" style="s2">problem that nobody knows how to deal</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.809" end="00:21:52.649" style="s2">with is the problem of scaling so in</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.609" end="00:21:54.299" style="s2">virtual environments in particular can</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.649" end="00:21:56.249" style="s2">scale rapidly right in principle</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.299" end="00:21:58.529" style="s2">everybody on the planet can join your</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.249" end="00:21:59.700" style="s2">discord tomorrow probably not that many</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.529" end="00:22:01.710" style="s2">but close like within a couple of days</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.700" end="00:22:03.559" style="s2">but of course in practice it would do</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.710" end="00:22:07.349" style="s2">that it would destroy your community and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.559" end="00:22:10.289" style="s2">so one of the things that is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.349" end="00:22:12.389" style="s2">is to actually have a I guess an company</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.289" end="00:22:13.110" style="s2">to call onboarding but some some process</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.389" end="00:22:15.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.110" end="00:22:18.090" style="s2">autocatalytic so that as an aspirin if</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.240" end="00:22:19.800" style="s2">an aspirin has strength meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.090" end="00:22:20.970" style="s2">there they have a capacity of carrying a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.800" end="00:22:24.150" style="s2">certain load because they&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.970" end="00:22:27.690" style="s2">through something again that going</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.150" end="00:22:30.030" style="s2">through this required enough from them</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.690" end="00:22:31.470" style="s2">that they have skin in the game they</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.030" end="00:22:33.210" style="s2">care they actually care like they</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.470" end="00:22:35.100" style="s2">actually have some blood in this thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.210" end="00:22:37.980" style="s2">so they may wanted to continue to endure</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.100" end="00:22:40.530" style="s2">and again when skillfully designed the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.980" end="00:22:42.660" style="s2">the thing they went through also left</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.530" end="00:22:45.270" style="s2">its mark on them by just giving them an</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.660" end="00:22:47.130" style="s2">insight change them in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.270" end="00:22:49.530" style="s2">actually wove them into the fabric of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.130" end="00:22:52.830" style="s2">but they are a natural expression</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.530" end="00:22:54.660" style="s2">natural exponent of the thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.830" end="00:22:57.780" style="s2">therefore as they show up in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.660" end="00:23:00.090" style="s2">environment the essence of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.780" end="00:23:01.290" style="s2">percolates more easily and you can just</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.090" end="00:23:05.970" style="s2">kind of think about the ratio between</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.290" end="00:23:10.230" style="s2">how many members and you actually have</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.970" end="00:23:11.670" style="s2">per unit or per aspirin before you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.230" end="00:23:14.130" style="s2">actually start to see decoherence</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.670" end="00:23:16.770" style="s2">because there&#39;s too much too little</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.130" end="00:23:22.620" style="s2">signal for the amount of noise in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.770" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">environment right by the way yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.620" end="00:23:26.010" style="s2">a fundamentally hard problem and as I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:29.790" style="s2">mentioned nobody actually knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.010" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">do it well so anybody who is like what</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.790" end="00:23:37.410" style="s2">you guys are focusing on makes it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:38.910" style="s2">almost part of your purpose and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.410" end="00:23:41.460" style="s2">like any original religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.910" end="00:23:44.370" style="s2">religion under its design requirement is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.460" end="00:23:50.190" style="s2">that it must be able to scale without</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.370" end="00:23:55.290" style="s2">flipping into reciprocal Maryland good</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.190" end="00:23:57.540" style="s2">luck problem itself thank you and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.290" end="00:24:00.150" style="s2">this has been amazing thank you so much</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.540" end="00:24:04.260" style="s2">for this now just before we get the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.150" end="00:24:08.010" style="s2">question so I did send a Jordan the are</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.260" end="00:24:12.450" style="s2">draft document from on these from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.010" end="00:24:16.460" style="s2">structure forum channel with our with</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.450" end="00:24:19.320" style="s2">the communities draft structure I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.460" end="00:24:23.010" style="s2">Jordan didn&#39;t have time to really look</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.320" end="00:24:25.400" style="s2">at it before before we started but but I</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.010" end="00:24:27.990" style="s2">you took a quick glance</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.400" end="00:24:31.640" style="s2">I think you said you would you would</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.990" end="00:24:34.680" style="s2">have to spend hours just on each line</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.640" end="00:24:39.180" style="s2">but uh but maybe we&#39;ll have a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.680" end="00:24:40.980" style="s2">talk about that uh that another time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.180" end="00:24:42.510" style="s2">reading the question you put in game</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.980" end="00:24:45.180" style="s2">theory what would be the progression</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.510" end="00:24:48.420" style="s2">after distributed organization in</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.180" end="00:24:50.040" style="s2">equilibrium a quantum leap in assisted</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.420" end="00:24:50.460" style="s2">artificial evolution want me to answer</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.040" end="00:24:54.210" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.460" end="00:25:01.410" style="s2">uh oh sure is that the first gonna I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.210" end="00:25:03.390" style="s2">going to go to the questions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.410" end="00:25:07.170" style="s2">I&#39;ll read ya out but that&#39;s that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.390" end="00:25:08.970" style="s2">huh I I&#39;ll read it out and and then then</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.170" end="00:25:10.890" style="s2">I would love to have your your answers</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.970" end="00:25:14.190" style="s2">so yes from gesture gesture be good</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.890" end="00:25:15.780" style="s2">would you hey Jordan thanks for your</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.190" end="00:25:17.490" style="s2">time and all the hard work I understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.780" end="00:25:19.710" style="s2">that in theory a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.490" end="00:25:22.740" style="s2">collective system of ideas beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.710" end="00:25:24.840" style="s2">practices like written are Sevilla could</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.740" end="00:25:26.520" style="s2">be prevented from being overtaken by an</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.840" end="00:25:27.900" style="s2">authority as long as it was maintained</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.900" end="00:25:33.150" style="s2">efficiency frontier what I and maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.660" end="00:25:35.730" style="s2">could explain what that is what I do not</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.150" end="00:25:39.450" style="s2">get yet is how does one a shirt ensure</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.730" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">that a super cult remains in equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.450" end="00:25:44.220" style="s2">at the frontier and also would one then</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">not be able to call it a super cult</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.220" end="00:25:48.300" style="s2">because at the frontier there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:50.550" style="s2">epistemically and therefore a super cult</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.300" end="00:25:52.440" style="s2">ceases to exist in relation in</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.550" end="00:25:54.750" style="s2">realization because of this lack of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.440" end="00:25:56.700" style="s2">conflict in game theory what would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.750" end="00:25:58.980" style="s2">the progression after distributed</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.700" end="00:26:02.480" style="s2">organization in equilibrium a quantum</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:12.270" style="s2">one my sense is that just to be good</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.260" end="00:26:12.840" style="s2">either is or has some familiarity with</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.270" end="00:26:14.970" style="s2">Pat Ryan</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.840" end="00:26:20.550" style="s2">it was very initial terms of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.970" end="00:26:23.570" style="s2">language to I hope that everybody enjoys</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.550" end="00:26:26.670" style="s2">the question because it&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.570" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">itself has a feeling of who would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.670" end="00:26:34.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not Miles Davis maybe it&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:36.300" style="s2">Coltrane and okay so is this something</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.830" end="00:26:38.760" style="s2">that you would like me to just spend</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.300" end="00:26:44.340" style="s2">some time on sure yes but I&#39;d love that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.760" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">Wow okay that&#39;s cool these Louie&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.340" end="00:26:49.470" style="s2">I&#39;d see who what I think would be at</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:53.130" style="s2">great is if if if actually Bester could</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.470" end="00:26:54.390" style="s2">it actually ends the question of or do a</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.130" end="00:26:56.160" style="s2">little bit more on the prevented from</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.390" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">being overtaken by an authority as long</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.160" end="00:27:00.990" style="s2">as it was maintained at the Pareto</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:03.059" style="s2">efficiency frontier maybe two sentences</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.990" end="00:27:05.340" style="s2">on that too or at me on specifically</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.059" end="00:27:07.410" style="s2">what the what the context is there and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.340" end="00:27:08.460" style="s2">then then we can then we can run all</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.410" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">right so why don&#39;t we go into the next</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.460" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">question and well while we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:15.240" style="s2">maybe gesture if you could just expand</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:17.330" style="s2">on that a little bit or or I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.240" end="00:27:20.549" style="s2">can always I don&#39;t know if your mics</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.330" end="00:27:23.130" style="s2">working you can always come on and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.549" end="00:27:25.350" style="s2">speak but so let&#39;s move on to the next</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.130" end="00:27:26.370" style="s2">one and then then we&#39;ll come back come</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.350" end="00:27:29.460" style="s2">back to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.370" end="00:27:31.830" style="s2">so from david student movement he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.460" end="00:27:34.890" style="s2">curious as to what your own ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.830" end="00:27:36.150" style="s2">practices look like with regard or or</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.890" end="00:27:44.520" style="s2">your influences with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.150" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">spirituality it&#39;s much easier when i I</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.520" end="00:27:51.059" style="s2">came into this notion of spirituality</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.270" end="00:28:10.280" style="s2">up until my early 40s which by the way</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.490" end="00:28:15.809" style="s2">actually to be perfectly frank it was it</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:16.650" style="s2">was the sensing on my part the awareness</p>

<p begin="00:28:33.620" end="00:28:42.299" style="s2">therefore I had kind of a a hodgepodge</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.250" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">pressed exploration so I worked through</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.299" end="00:28:48.809" style="s2">individuals like Benito Roy and Yoshi</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:23.130" style="s2">similar the problem what happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.370" end="00:33:26.820" style="s2">in an apparent ching relationship where</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.860" end="00:33:51.409" style="s2">is one of the interesting challenges</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.490" end="00:33:53.700" style="s2">that we have is we tend to try to use</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.409" end="00:33:58.380" style="s2">certain kinds of tools like say for</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.889" end="00:34:13.500" style="s2">and that but that&#39;s kind of that notion</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.210" end="00:34:15.300" style="s2">that set of distinctions is very much</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.500" end="00:34:16.770" style="s2">the essence of what I&#39;m I think I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.890" end="00:35:16.260" style="s2">do is to be the stewards of complex</p>

<p begin="00:35:22.170" end="00:35:27.390" style="s2">therefore we use our tools very</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.390" end="00:35:30.630" style="s2">to put it to say the same thing as I</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.980" end="00:35:34.230" style="s2">just said it in a very different way if</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.630" end="00:35:36.090" style="s2">you actually did a really good job in</p>

<p begin="00:35:46.770" end="00:35:50.550" style="s2">but they would actually just say hey I</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.780" end="00:35:52.740" style="s2">have to let you know that I have now</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.550" end="00:35:54.150" style="s2">become it&#39;s become clear to me but I</p>

<p begin="00:36:17.100" end="00:36:21.630" style="s2">says so he clarifies that there exists</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.050" end="00:37:04.190" style="s2">is cool it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.610" end="00:37:10.350" style="s2">let me see if I can answer this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.510" end="00:37:12.750" style="s2">gonna take a little bit of time I</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.350" end="00:37:15.800" style="s2">apologize I have to up to think about</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.140" end="00:37:32.430" style="s2">ah okay though the the key inside has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.739" end="00:37:35.130" style="s2">do with the recognition that game theory</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.430" end="00:37:38.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually operate in a complex</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">okay at this point I can truncate and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.759" end="00:38:10.200" style="s2">assume that it&#39;s finite so I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:13.079" style="s2">digitize the analog environment but as</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.940" end="00:40:03.729" style="s2">in the environment that their choices</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.380" end="00:40:06.729" style="s2">are meaningless or that there is well</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.729" end="00:40:08.259" style="s2">either because the environment lacks the</p>

<p begin="00:43:17.619" end="00:43:26.260" style="s2">a I said that was a melange not a clear</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:28.030" style="s2">answer so I apologize and was able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.260" end="00:43:31.510" style="s2">pull that together particularly well and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.030" end="00:43:32.859" style="s2">finding that the like this audio way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.510" end="00:43:33.790" style="s2">the way that it feels like right now I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.859" end="00:43:35.800" style="s2">don&#39;t even know that I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.790" end="00:43:37.660" style="s2">anybody is it difficult for me to hold</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.800" end="00:43:39.820" style="s2">on to the threat but oh that was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.660" end="00:43:43.330" style="s2">better than absolute waste of time</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.820" end="00:43:45.400" style="s2">no not not a waste at all yeah sorry we</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.330" end="00:43:48.210" style="s2">do need to do this audio otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.400" end="00:43:51.010" style="s2">people can&#39;t get into the room but</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.210" end="00:43:52.599" style="s2">hopefully though they&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.010" end="00:43:55.540" style="s2">expansions here on discourse at some</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.599" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">point and it would be great to do this</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.540" end="00:44:01.330" style="s2">with with video aunt Elijah who who</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:03.370" style="s2">wasn&#39;t played a big part in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.330" end="00:44:08.320" style="s2">document that I sent you</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.370" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">asks Oh actually did did you oh I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.320" end="00:44:17.290" style="s2">he wants me to say it I&#39;m not sure she</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:20.170" style="s2">did you want to ask yourself oh i was--</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.290" end="00:44:22.780" style="s2">is there a way collectively objectively</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.170" end="00:44:25.300" style="s2">to appraise wisdom and others would it</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.780" end="00:44:27.460" style="s2">be possible for us for a society to set</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.300" end="00:44:33.880" style="s2">wisdom requirements on positions that</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.460" end="00:44:35.170" style="s2">bestow great power my instincts say no</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.880" end="00:44:36.700" style="s2">and now i have to figure out why that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.170" end="00:44:37.360" style="s2">would be the case which is funny right</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.700" end="00:44:39.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.360" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">self-referential so so one</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.880" end="00:44:44.770" style="s2">characteristic would have to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:47.520" style="s2">same conversation about the this that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.770" end="00:44:51.420" style="s2">which can be enumerated in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:55.270" style="s2">metro sized like integer structure say</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.420" end="00:44:59.500" style="s2">objectively in some sense means to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.270" end="00:45:03.490" style="s2">able to enumerate to measure in some</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.500" end="00:45:05.860" style="s2">kind of discreet and and at least in</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.490" end="00:45:08.920" style="s2">that context the answer has to be no</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.860" end="00:45:10.540" style="s2">because wisdom by definition has to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.920" end="00:45:14.110" style="s2">with they act like a pasty that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.540" end="00:45:16.570" style="s2">applied in a given context and so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.110" end="00:45:18.850" style="s2">context matters context matters reduce</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.570" end="00:45:20.380" style="s2">ibly so for example you could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.850" end="00:45:22.030" style="s2">you can you could measure you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.380" end="00:45:24.420" style="s2">create a test that could I say T for</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.030" end="00:45:29.770" style="s2">wisdom it would be able to measure the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.420" end="00:45:31.150" style="s2">depth quality of approach at that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.770" end="00:45:37.960" style="s2">doable and I&#39;ve actually seen some that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.150" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">exist but this is really the depth or</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.960" end="00:45:44.790" style="s2">quality of approach that is taken to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:47.260" style="s2">given context and this can give you a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.790" end="00:45:48.790" style="s2">qualitative sense like I and to some</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.260" end="00:45:52.690" style="s2">extent a measurable sense that you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.790" end="00:45:56.080" style="s2">differentiate between gross a degrees or</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.690" end="00:45:58.390" style="s2">levels and there&#39;s certainly utility to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.080" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">that and an exact exact Stein I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.390" end="00:46:06.420" style="s2">point to as being a primary person</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:06.420" style="s2">vastly more capable had informed</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.839" end="00:46:13.690" style="s2">but it has it&#39;s just more capable of</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.310" end="00:46:15.160" style="s2">saying things than me in this domain so</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.690" end="00:46:16.900" style="s2">that&#39;s actually where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.160" end="00:46:18.580" style="s2">interesting so it&#39;s in there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.900" end="00:46:20.650" style="s2">about even the mindset of the intention</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.580" end="00:46:24.940" style="s2">that is desire I mean those physics</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.650" end="00:46:26.290" style="s2">linked to this initiative technology to</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.940" end="00:46:28.300" style="s2">do so right to find some way of hey</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.290" end="00:46:31.270" style="s2">Keaton can we scale wisdom by being able</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.300" end="00:46:32.619" style="s2">to automate even the measurement of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.270" end="00:46:34.450" style="s2">or if not automated needs to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.619" end="00:46:36.369" style="s2">have an interest objective scoring</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.450" end="00:46:37.900" style="s2">mechanism and therefore be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.369" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">it kind of attached to an identity as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.900" end="00:46:44.859" style="s2">reputation score and my sense is it by</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:46.869" style="s2">the way god I&#39;ve thought about that a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.859" end="00:46:48.849" style="s2">lot in it part of me definitely hopes</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.869" end="00:46:54.760" style="s2">that the answer is yes so I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.849" end="00:47:01.510" style="s2">that I&#39;m of devided intent whether or</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.760" end="00:47:03.580" style="s2">not I&#39;ve divided the opinion and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.510" end="00:47:05.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s kind of a rough yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.580" end="00:47:07.030" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like have you guys ever</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.500" end="00:47:09.609" style="s2">done with processes that go through a</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.030" end="00:47:11.830" style="s2">human to machine to human AI so instead</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.609" end="00:47:14.470" style="s2">of a AI the strictly machine ik it</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.830" end="00:47:15.970" style="s2">actually has a multiple loops humans</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.470" end="00:47:17.470" style="s2">will input the machine while output</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.970" end="00:47:18.520" style="s2">humans will then process that and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.470" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">the machine will do something like you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.520" end="00:47:23.589" style="s2">actually loop through it there may be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:25.390" style="s2">way of doing that for you for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.589" end="00:47:28.390" style="s2">you have a multi-layered context that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.390" end="00:47:30.099" style="s2">has kind of a machine ik layer that has</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.390" end="00:47:32.560" style="s2">the capacity to do certain levels of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.099" end="00:47:34.270" style="s2">orientation and pruning or it does it</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.560" end="00:47:36.460" style="s2">then hands that off to a human layer</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.270" end="00:47:38.080" style="s2">there&#39;s just kind of transferring it</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.460" end="00:47:40.780" style="s2">back into the subjective and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.080" end="00:47:42.700" style="s2">interest objective and as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.780" end="00:47:44.140" style="s2">maintain this this notion of flowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.700" end="00:47:45.640" style="s2">back and forth and you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.140" end="00:47:48.540" style="s2">symmetry which the Machine layer can</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.640" end="00:47:51.700" style="s2">overwhelm the human layer in velocity</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.540" end="00:47:53.320" style="s2">and the the choice making it the end</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.700" end="00:47:54.760" style="s2">state is always happening to human layer</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.320" end="00:47:56.080" style="s2">then you start getting something that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.760" end="00:48:00.790" style="s2">thing could actually be very functional</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.080" end="00:48:02.950" style="s2">or both dealing with the question of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.790" end="00:48:06.220" style="s2">wisdom and empowering wisdom in a more</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.950" end="00:48:09.690" style="s2">scalable way and in the role of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.220" end="00:48:09.690" style="s2">Technology in scaling these systems so</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.720" end="00:48:14.290" style="s2">related to wisdom you spoke with John</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.310" end="00:48:16.620" style="s2">about the critical importance of being</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.290" end="00:48:18.460" style="s2">able to rightly attune one&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.620" end="00:48:20.770" style="s2">how do you think the average person</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.460" end="00:48:23.470" style="s2">should learn how to do this so in other</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.770" end="00:48:26.500" style="s2">words how do we become Special Forces as</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.470" end="00:48:31.300" style="s2">you talked about with John wait say that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.500" end="00:48:33.220" style="s2">again so you talked about the importance</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.300" end="00:48:35.860" style="s2">of being able to write Lee a tune once</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.220" end="00:48:39.400" style="s2">attention to to decide what one should</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.860" end="00:48:41.020" style="s2">allocate our our attention to in our</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.400" end="00:48:43.830" style="s2">limited time on earth I think he called</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.020" end="00:48:46.390" style="s2">it one of the most precious commodities</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.830" end="00:48:49.000" style="s2">for the average for an average person</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.390" end="00:48:54.270" style="s2">just the people in this group how how</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.000" end="00:48:57.270" style="s2">would how would you recommend I feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.270" end="00:48:59.110" style="s2">maybe this is just super good news I</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.270" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">think this is actually the most average</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.110" end="00:49:05.130" style="s2">of capacities it certainly is present in</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:07.600" style="s2">infant so I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.130" end="00:49:11.350" style="s2">literally a brand new born and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.600" end="00:49:13.930" style="s2">within the first three days if you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.350" end="00:49:17.980" style="s2">know a mom is holding the child and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.930" end="00:49:20.440" style="s2">another person let&#39;s say dad reaches out</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.980" end="00:49:22.090" style="s2">the hands to create a felt sense of you</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.440" end="00:49:24.880" style="s2">know transition like what would you be</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.090" end="00:49:26.200" style="s2">interested in being held and this is by</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.880" end="00:49:29.890" style="s2">the way but at the point where the child</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.200" end="00:49:32.230" style="s2">can&#39;t actually visually perceive faces</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.890" end="00:49:34.990" style="s2">particularly well nonetheless the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.230" end="00:49:38.920" style="s2">capacity to sense the presence of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.990" end="00:49:40.690" style="s2">state change and to feel in the body and</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.690" end="00:49:46.330" style="s2">the opportunity of that state change is</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.610" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">there and and then by the way to express</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.330" end="00:49:52.690" style="s2">a preference is also there requires</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:55.960" style="s2">presence and the part of the adults</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.690" end="00:49:59.470" style="s2">involved to aware of it it&#39;s that level</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.960" end="00:50:01.510" style="s2">of basic and so this no I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.470" end="00:50:01.720" style="s2">call that skill discernment because why</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.510" end="00:50:03.850" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.720" end="00:50:07.420" style="s2">we&#39;re banding words about someone</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.850" end="00:50:08.710" style="s2">abusively the question I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.420" end="00:50:10.900" style="s2">question of how do we cultivate in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.710" end="00:50:13.000" style="s2">ourselves this most ambient in the most</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.900" end="00:50:16.270" style="s2">basic of human capabilities and how do</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.000" end="00:50:18.280" style="s2">we recover the degree to which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.270" end="00:50:19.930" style="s2">lost it I think most of its in that last</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.280" end="00:50:22.050" style="s2">category or most of the problem that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.930" end="00:50:25.660" style="s2">think most people face is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.050" end="00:50:27.580" style="s2">particularly through education our our</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.660" end="00:50:30.130" style="s2">our basic toolkit has been some</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.580" end="00:50:33.339" style="s2">combination of blunted</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.130" end="00:50:34.420" style="s2">roken in taken away but the fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.339" end="00:50:36.630" style="s2">thing is that starting over at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.420" end="00:50:39.099" style="s2">basics is very simple so for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.630" end="00:50:41.769" style="s2">practice rediscovering what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.099" end="00:50:43.180" style="s2">foods you actually like if your self</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.769" end="00:50:45.490" style="s2">permission to not have a preconceived</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.180" end="00:50:49.150" style="s2">notion of what foods you ought to eat</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.490" end="00:50:52.269" style="s2">and that your body appreciates and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.150" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">just buy something slowly thoughtfully</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.269" end="00:50:56.500" style="s2">intentionally and then notice like what</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:58.210" style="s2">does it actually feel like very</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.500" end="00:51:01.930" style="s2">basically they&#39;re just a gross sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.210" end="00:51:03.069" style="s2">like yes this or notice for example you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.930" end="00:51:04.779" style="s2">can kind of do that with anything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.069" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like being a Tai Chi you can slow</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.779" end="00:51:08.049" style="s2">things down and make the movement</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:09.400" style="s2">infinitesimally and that actually is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.049" end="00:51:12.039" style="s2">way that you get the highest felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.400" end="00:51:13.599" style="s2">of what right movement is like all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.039" end="00:51:15.130" style="s2">that&#39;s another example you can do it in</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.599" end="00:51:17.890" style="s2">Tai Chi by just simply moving your body</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.130" end="00:51:19.509" style="s2">one centimeter but what I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.890" end="00:51:23.650" style="s2">recommend is actually doing this across</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.509" end="00:51:25.089" style="s2">a wide portfolio to the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.650" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">you have skillfulness a particular</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.089" end="00:51:27.849" style="s2">domain you can also hone it at a higher</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:29.259" style="s2">level I can&#39;t say you happen to be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.849" end="00:51:33.400" style="s2">graphic designer</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.259" end="00:51:35.200" style="s2">notice the the felt sense in you that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.400" end="00:51:38.289" style="s2">Orient&#39;s towards what yes this or</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:40.869" style="s2">rightness or yeah that&#39;s it and no not</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.289" end="00:51:42.369" style="s2">quite there feels like and then just be</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.869" end="00:51:45.400" style="s2">conscious with the fact that that same</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.369" end="00:51:46.809" style="s2">thing works everywhere now you may have</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.400" end="00:51:49.119" style="s2">you haven&#39;t may not have built the right</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.809" end="00:51:51.190" style="s2">kinds of inputs and outputs and be able</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.119" end="00:51:54.039" style="s2">to deploy it in all domains but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.190" end="00:51:55.960" style="s2">same basic skill I think as John</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.039" end="00:51:58.029" style="s2">mentioned it may actually be oriented</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.960" end="00:51:59.259" style="s2">towards like the part of the cortex</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.029" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with the same like</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.259" end="00:52:02.799" style="s2">physical balance I can maybe actually be</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">neurological correlates at the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.799" end="00:52:07.000" style="s2">skill and so what you can do is you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:08.200" style="s2">both hone it vertically in domain so you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.000" end="00:52:09.910" style="s2">actually had developed some level</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.200" end="00:52:11.710" style="s2">skillfulness and of course just say an</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.910" end="00:52:13.059" style="s2">average person&#39;s to say everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.710" end="00:52:14.289" style="s2">developed that it may be you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.059" end="00:52:15.369" style="s2">skillfulness and appreciating a</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.289" end="00:52:17.170" style="s2">particularly high quality football</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.369" end="00:52:19.150" style="s2">playing college football doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.170" end="00:52:22.029" style="s2">right just okay to become conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.150" end="00:52:23.710" style="s2">how you appreciate the wholeness and how</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.029" end="00:52:25.559" style="s2">you appreciate the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.710" end="00:52:31.289" style="s2">rightness and wrongness in any domain</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.559" end="00:52:34.809" style="s2">then work on basic ones who touch well</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.289" end="00:52:36.460" style="s2">breathing pace like speed slows things</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.809" end="00:52:37.930" style="s2">down and speed things up and notice like</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.460" end="00:52:39.819" style="s2">which pace it&#39;s actually more writing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.930" end="00:52:42.490" style="s2">more wrongness and then just close the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.819" end="00:52:44.020" style="s2">gap and neck the space between the is we</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.490" end="00:52:46.150" style="s2">have high skillfulness and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.020" end="00:52:49.150" style="s2">capacity and you&#39;ll begin to see these</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.150" end="00:52:53.380" style="s2">things vectoring towards a higher basis</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.150" end="00:52:57.430" style="s2">yeah chocolates good excess is good</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.380" end="00:52:58.750" style="s2">excise no rate X is one of the best X in</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.430" end="00:53:05.290" style="s2">chocolate for me are great closely kin</p>

<p begin="00:53:52.540" end="00:53:56.050" style="s2">sense-making arenas appear to be</p>

<p begin="00:53:56.050" end="00:54:00.190" style="s2">around the sacred or divine a concept in</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.480" end="00:54:03.310" style="s2">and of itself that I feel is fully</p>

<p begin="00:54:13.900" end="00:54:17.560" style="s2">of a better term sacred or divine I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.119" end="00:54:19.869" style="s2">been struggling with how a written R</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.560" end="00:54:22.390" style="s2">could actually work and oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.869" end="00:54:24.580" style="s2">sounds or feels a fear that this</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.390" end="00:54:26.470" style="s2">conception is challenged because of an</p>

<p begin="00:54:26.470" end="00:54:30.940" style="s2">religion but this in mind what would you</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.930" end="00:54:33.400" style="s2">consider the opposition or challenge to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.940" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">creating a religion or calling it for</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.400" end="00:54:37.390" style="s2">what it is that is a religion and just</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:40.119" style="s2">for the YouTube audience written R</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.390" end="00:54:44.050" style="s2">stands for the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.119" end="00:54:45.250" style="s2">religion okay good I&#39;m actually really</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.050" end="00:54:47.470" style="s2">glad to have this question because</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.250" end="00:54:52.690" style="s2">there&#39;s come up a few times in certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.470" end="00:54:56.590" style="s2">comments and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;m late</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.690" end="00:54:58.479" style="s2">to address it earlier I referenced a</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.590" end="00:55:02.739" style="s2">particular tribe</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.479" end="00:55:06.400" style="s2">made the point not writing down the name</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.739" end="00:55:09.309" style="s2">of the divine and being quite careful</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.400" end="00:55:12.789" style="s2">about that circumspect</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.309" end="00:55:14.199" style="s2">I think that&#39;s there&#39;s a good reason for</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.789" end="00:55:18.150" style="s2">that and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.199" end="00:55:22.289" style="s2">the answer to the question to define who</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.150" end="00:55:25.449" style="s2">who endeavor to define who endeavor to</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.289" end="00:55:27.479" style="s2">it so fully pierce the veil of mystery</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.449" end="00:55:31.209" style="s2">as to render it no longer mystery is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.479" end="00:55:34.420" style="s2">defilement is in fact the is the essence</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.209" end="00:55:36.549" style="s2">and the intuition of the profane so to</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.420" end="00:55:38.559" style="s2">hold the sacred sacred has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.549" end="00:55:39.969" style="s2">requirement and part of that is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:41.739" style="s2">actually recognize that there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.969" end="00:55:44.349" style="s2">of feeling and being in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.739" end="00:55:47.499" style="s2">which is to say to know knowing deeply</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.349" end="00:55:51.519" style="s2">and without this least bit of question</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.499" end="00:55:54.489" style="s2">that the divine is that must by</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.519" end="00:55:56.289" style="s2">necessity avoid at all costs any effort</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.489" end="00:55:58.479" style="s2">to put the divine on the rack of</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.289" end="00:56:02.920" style="s2">definition and to render it merely</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.479" end="00:56:05.049" style="s2">propositional oh this I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.920" end="00:56:11.170" style="s2">thing that is trying to be held with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.049" end="00:56:13.029" style="s2">NA and the written our construct and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.170" end="00:56:15.609" style="s2">get it I get the fact that there has</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.029" end="00:56:17.529" style="s2">been for at least the past 150 or 200</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.609" end="00:56:20.890" style="s2">years and increasingly over the past</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.529" end="00:56:25.989" style="s2">over decades a building default state</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.890" end="00:56:29.019" style="s2">and tippity to the jens a-- and to</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.989" end="00:56:30.670" style="s2">religion in general and and i get it i</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.019" end="00:56:32.979" style="s2">get both the the thing that gave rise to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.670" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">them participate and to the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.979" end="00:56:39.009" style="s2">which that is a problem a lot a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:41.199" style="s2">error behind it but what i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.009" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">propose is that the right answers in</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.199" end="00:56:47.650" style="s2">some sense neither that the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.640" end="00:56:49.180" style="s2">and the the thing that causes the thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.650" end="00:56:52.150" style="s2">that has been called a religion to go</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.180" end="00:56:54.059" style="s2">off the rails is precisely the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.150" end="00:56:57.099" style="s2">profaning of the sacred went beyond</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.059" end="00:56:59.400" style="s2">either just forgetting a necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.099" end="00:57:02.559" style="s2">recognizing that the transcendent is</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.400" end="00:57:05.949" style="s2">transcendent and that as we endeavor to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.559" end="00:57:07.959" style="s2">name it we can be helpful but also can</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.949" end="00:57:10.630" style="s2">create enormous amounts of confusion and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.959" end="00:57:11.500" style="s2">harm because almost everybody takes the</p>

<p begin="00:58:28.870" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a role of Technology and scaling</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.150" end="00:58:36.190" style="s2">these types of systems and practices and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:38.560" style="s2">I&#39;m just wondering if you can share you</p>

<p begin="00:58:38.560" end="00:58:42.940" style="s2">solutions that can facilitate things</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.780" end="00:58:45.670" style="s2">like this you know there there were some</p>

<p begin="00:58:45.670" end="00:58:51.550" style="s2">platforms like blockchain and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.860" end="00:58:53.320" style="s2">when society adopts that at a broader</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.550" end="00:58:54.730" style="s2">scale that might be viable but I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.320" end="00:58:57.550" style="s2">thinking about other ways that</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.730" end="00:59:02.050" style="s2">technology can can help contribute to so</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.550" end="00:59:05.320" style="s2">appreciate your thoughts oh gosh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.050" end="00:59:06.850" style="s2">welcome I wish they were better what I</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.320" end="00:59:09.160" style="s2">can say is that I have struggled with</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.850" end="00:59:12.760" style="s2">trying to get a good answer this</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.160" end="00:59:15.250" style="s2">question for about two decades now and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.760" end="00:59:19.180" style="s2">can say that my intuitions as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.250" end="00:59:23.080" style="s2">who came up through technology have</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.180" end="00:59:24.220" style="s2">proven to be largely wrong and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.080" end="00:59:25.300" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve noticed is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.220" end="00:59:28.630" style="s2">it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.300" end="00:59:29.770" style="s2">me to be be careful not to go too fast</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.630" end="00:59:32.070" style="s2">through what I would consider kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.770" end="00:59:36.250" style="s2">like the ordinary techniques of</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.070" end="00:59:39.580" style="s2">availability and even systems design to</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.250" end="00:59:41.590" style="s2">be very very mindful of where I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.580" end="00:59:44.290" style="s2">instincts were maybe the instincts of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.590" end="00:59:47.170" style="s2">technological civilization often time</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.290" end="00:59:53.400" style="s2">leads us awry so I&#39;ll give you an</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.170" end="00:59:57.190" style="s2">example a nature typically doesn&#39;t scale</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.400" end="00:59:59.290" style="s2">and so if you design something that does</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.190" end="01:00:01.150" style="s2">scale one of the things that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.290" end="01:00:04.240" style="s2">happen is you&#39;ll be up regulating some</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.150" end="01:00:07.410" style="s2">subset of reality to a much higher level</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.240" end="01:00:09.420" style="s2">than is available in all the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.410" end="01:00:12.880" style="s2">aspects of reality that are not being</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.420" end="01:00:14.470" style="s2">thus scale and so therefore it can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.880" end="01:00:17.680" style="s2">quite trivial to accidentally break</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.470" end="01:00:19.900" style="s2">homeostatic systems apart problems of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.680" end="01:00:21.460" style="s2">accumulation extraction is a always</p>

<p begin="01:00:21.460" end="01:00:25.750" style="s2">mentioned in different contexts so the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.130" end="01:00:28.570" style="s2">answer I&#39;ve actually found is that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.750" end="01:00:30.910" style="s2">we those who are our systems designers</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.570" end="01:00:33.880" style="s2">and technologists actually have to up</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.910" end="01:00:36.450" style="s2">our game quite substantially before I</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.880" end="01:00:42.040" style="s2">think we&#39;re actually going to be truly</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.450" end="01:00:43.180" style="s2">effective well well no no in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.040" end="01:00:44.470" style="s2">that&#39;s okay because it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.180" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">actually a relatively new discipline</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.470" end="01:00:50.560" style="s2">even computer science by itself is only</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:52.540" style="s2">what five decades old I&#39;ll stop and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.560" end="01:00:55.600" style="s2">know look about how much havoc economics</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.540" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">is wrought I trying to wield power in</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.600" end="01:01:00.460" style="s2">its adolescence so a bit of humility to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:01.900" style="s2">say hey we have a fundamental not even a</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.460" end="01:01:04.930" style="s2">meaningful but a fundamental role to</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.900" end="01:01:07.300" style="s2">play is to say technologists and also</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.930" end="01:01:09.250" style="s2">we&#39;re not yet capable to play that role</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.300" end="01:01:11.260" style="s2">fully so let&#39;s go into it let&#39;s take it</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.250" end="01:01:12.970" style="s2">seriously and really take a look at and</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.260" end="01:01:16.630" style="s2">what are the key problems of how we can</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.970" end="01:01:17.740" style="s2">think about how do you scale homeostatic</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.630" end="01:01:21.190" style="s2">lee how do you actually think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.740" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">whole systems design and how do you make</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.190" end="01:01:24.970" style="s2">sure that you&#39;re actually up regulating</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:28.390" style="s2">the intrinsics of integral systems</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.970" end="01:01:30.010" style="s2">they&#39;re able to grow without breaking</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.390" end="01:01:33.150" style="s2">symmetry relationships that then cause</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.010" end="01:01:35.710" style="s2">whole chunks of complexity to shatter</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.150" end="01:01:37.060" style="s2">you know the kinds of questions they</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.710" end="01:01:38.560" style="s2">were asked in terms of database theory</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.060" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">in the 70s we should be asking those</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.560" end="01:01:40.990" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:43.600" style="s2">terms of the relationship and complexity</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.990" end="01:01:46.300" style="s2">and complicated is now well and years</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.600" end="01:01:48.280" style="s2">ago unfortunately that would then give</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.300" end="01:01:50.440" style="s2">us a lot more power and let me throw out</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.280" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s one angle that it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.440" end="01:01:54.190" style="s2">angle of humility and taking our</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.170" style="s2">humility pills seriously and then and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.190" end="01:02:00.850" style="s2">then recognize that we can do it we just</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.170" end="01:02:03.030" style="s2">have to be more diligent and focused two</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.850" end="01:02:07.300" style="s2">more pieces actually so the next piece</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.030" end="01:02:10.320" style="s2">we are the are ever since and I&#39;m just</p>

<p begin="01:05:10.829" end="01:05:15.249" style="s2">the answer is weird like the answer</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.420" end="01:05:18.339" style="s2">doesn&#39;t as far as I can tell doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:05:21.369" end="01:05:27.880" style="s2">stuff like that it comes through two</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.690" end="01:05:29.440" style="s2">things one is is actually finding ways</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.880" end="01:05:31.029" style="s2">to form the right kinds of relationships</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.440" end="01:05:35.920" style="s2">with right kinds of skill sets that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.029" end="01:05:37.119" style="s2">support us well you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.920" end="01:05:39.160" style="s2">again this book I mentioned the gym</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.119" end="01:05:40.900" style="s2">recommended the indigenous gentleman</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.160" end="01:05:43.329" style="s2">from Australia he has a technique he</p>

<p begin="01:05:43.329" end="01:05:47.499" style="s2">spin a yarn to tell a tale that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.400" end="01:05:48.759" style="s2">really cool relationship like change</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.499" end="01:05:51.309" style="s2">from the notion of requirements</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.759" end="01:05:52.599" style="s2">gathering like Co creative weaving and</p>

<p begin="01:06:02.049" end="01:06:05.819" style="s2">entered there but I think there was some</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.910" end="01:06:09.900" style="s2">pretty good stuff there in the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.819" end="01:06:11.190" style="s2">I definitely appreciate it we just have</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.900" end="01:06:13.499" style="s2">a few minutes left for a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.190" end="01:06:16.769" style="s2">than an hour did you do you do you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.499" end="01:06:18.869" style="s2">time for just a few more I think two</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.769" end="01:06:20.609" style="s2">more would be good okay well first one</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.869" end="01:06:22.440" style="s2">very short one but I think very</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.609" end="01:06:39.959" style="s2">important from Tyler chocolate is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.440" end="01:06:41.279" style="s2">best flow state yes or no no no that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.959" end="01:06:43.829" style="s2">thing about chocolate that you can mix</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.279" end="01:06:46.859" style="s2">chocolate other things and correct</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.829" end="01:06:50.489" style="s2">your gistic yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a topping</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.859" end="01:06:51.779" style="s2">let&#39;s say okay so no I let me squeeze in</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.489" end="01:06:54.979" style="s2">a real question if I can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.779" end="01:06:57.959" style="s2">interrupted in two already anyways um</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.979" end="01:07:02.999" style="s2">your work and coming into contact with</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.959" end="01:07:05.339" style="s2">this stuff that even doing is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.999" end="01:07:08.969" style="s2">catapulted me into quite an adventure of</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.339" end="01:07:11.999" style="s2">the past few years and one of the I</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.969" end="01:07:14.279" style="s2">think one of the first pieces that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.999" end="01:07:16.519" style="s2">smashed headlong into is let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.279" end="01:07:19.109" style="s2">notion of humility and systems design</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.519" end="01:07:21.509" style="s2">and doing any kind of engineering work</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.109" end="01:07:24.930" style="s2">and trying to get complex systems to</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.509" end="01:07:27.269" style="s2">coordinate well and and so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.930" end="01:07:29.190" style="s2">partially that which has led me to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.269" end="01:07:31.229" style="s2">spot that I&#39;m in now and attempts to</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.190" end="01:07:33.209" style="s2">understand the scalability issue and and</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.229" end="01:07:35.969" style="s2">somewhat also something like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.209" end="01:07:38.219" style="s2">measurement issue where the influence in</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.969" end="01:07:40.559" style="s2">the system when you&#39;re taking a look at</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.219" end="01:07:42.839" style="s2">it has a profound impact but I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.559" end="01:07:45.420" style="s2">about this notion right is is it is this</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.839" end="01:07:48.329" style="s2">a place is something like this digital</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.420" end="01:07:50.279" style="s2">landscape a place where we can iterate</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.329" end="01:07:51.869" style="s2">in the same way that evolution solved</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.279" end="01:07:54.239" style="s2">the hard problem of the open-ended</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.869" end="01:07:56.759" style="s2">question of suitability or adaptability</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.239" end="01:07:59.459" style="s2">by just iterative design can we do that</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.759" end="01:08:02.459" style="s2">here in this space where we&#39;ve where we</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.459" end="01:08:04.739" style="s2">do eventually solve this this</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.459" end="01:08:06.779" style="s2">fundamental relational problem that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.739" end="01:08:09.349" style="s2">seems to be cropping up so persistently</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.779" end="01:08:12.239" style="s2">in human evolution I get the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.349" end="01:08:13.799" style="s2">this is kind of a key piece in order for</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.239" end="01:08:16.109" style="s2">the rest of it to fall together and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.799" end="01:08:18.210" style="s2">that maybe it&#39;s intuitive iam and all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.109" end="01:08:19.319" style="s2">that right so yes alright we lob that in</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.210" end="01:08:21.479" style="s2">there and</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.319" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a really that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.479" end="01:08:27.499" style="s2">deep question the language actually has</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.159" end="01:08:29.999" style="s2">to do with the proposition</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.499" end="01:08:32.009" style="s2">epistemological that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.999" end="01:08:34.859" style="s2">distinction between what you might call</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.009" end="01:08:37.559" style="s2">an evolutionary process and what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.859" end="01:08:38.939" style="s2">might call design process and I should</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.559" end="01:08:40.079" style="s2">say I&#39;ve been in a lot of arguments</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.939" end="01:08:42.809" style="s2">about this and I&#39;ve been on both sides</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.079" end="01:08:44.729" style="s2">of the argument so one might argue for</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.809" end="01:08:47.389" style="s2">example the design process is just</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.729" end="01:08:51.089" style="s2">rapidly iterated evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.389" end="01:08:54.650" style="s2">but the hypothesis tonight and I now</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.089" end="01:08:58.259" style="s2">agree the hypothesis that&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.650" end="01:08:59.999" style="s2">is it and maybe a way of looking into it</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.259" end="01:09:05.249" style="s2">I hate to do this because it feels like</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.999" end="01:09:07.849" style="s2">it&#39;s abusing the concepts but you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.249" end="01:09:10.170" style="s2">the way the distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.849" end="01:09:17.309" style="s2">traditional computing and quantum</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.170" end="01:09:22.679" style="s2">computing that there&#39;s a way to approach</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.309" end="01:09:24.749" style="s2">a particular problem domain that is it</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.679" end="01:09:29.309" style="s2">operates in terms of an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.749" end="01:09:31.739" style="s2">wholeness and either holds together a</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.309" end="01:09:33.630" style="s2">dozen but it doesn&#39;t get there through</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.739" end="01:09:37.289" style="s2">an iterative process we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.630" end="01:09:39.509" style="s2">interview of analytic process and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.289" end="01:09:41.159" style="s2">cannot be formally modeled as such so</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.509" end="01:09:42.989" style="s2">which is to say that it&#39;s not that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.159" end="01:09:43.949" style="s2">move towards wholeness and then you</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.989" end="01:09:47.549" style="s2">don&#39;t get there so you try a different</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.949" end="01:09:50.219" style="s2">analytic variation because it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:09:50.219" end="01:09:54.329" style="s2">something else it&#39;s in that Ellis is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.979" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">whole point by the way for those of us</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.329" end="01:09:56.400" style="s2">who were talking with you everything</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:10:00.150" style="s2">that Ellison is my precisely to that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.400" end="01:10:02.010" style="s2">thing that shouldn&#39;t be spoken up but</p>

<p begin="01:10:16.409" end="01:10:21.809" style="s2">from subtlety into increasing on cretan</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.860" end="01:10:25.229" style="s2">us with something that sort of just</p>

<p begin="01:10:25.229" end="01:10:28.199" style="s2">just you know now we&#39;re kind of in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.459" end="01:10:32.030" style="s2">middle of it I think is a very right and</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.199" end="01:10:34.400" style="s2">powerful question that&#39;s my current</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.030" end="01:10:38.330" style="s2">opposition a current proposition is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.400" end="01:10:40.520" style="s2">the primary capacity that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.330" end="01:10:40.970" style="s2">built and those who are doing that kind</p>

<p begin="01:10:40.970" end="01:10:48.820" style="s2">is that kind of capacity and and as that</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.060" end="01:10:50.690" style="s2">skillfulness gets to be too bill built</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.820" end="01:10:52.430" style="s2">awkwardness at the language I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.690" end="01:10:53.810" style="s2">right now become a lot less awkward and</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.430" end="01:10:56.270" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to have like a whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.810" end="01:10:57.770" style="s2">awesome okay I&#39;m with a for describing</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.270" end="01:10:59.990" style="s2">these kinds of things and it will turn</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.770" end="01:11:04.340" style="s2">out to be compatible with an adjunct to</p>

<p begin="01:11:04.340" end="01:11:09.530" style="s2">can for sure run in a digital space but</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.910" end="01:11:11.360" style="s2">that will not actually hold the desert</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.530" end="01:11:13.130" style="s2">its far as I can tell distinct and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.360" end="01:11:15.800" style="s2">crucial to actually be held distinct and</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.130" end="01:11:18.460" style="s2">that a set of questions that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.800" end="01:11:20.270" style="s2">appropriate for one is not actually</p>

<p begin="01:11:20.270" end="01:11:24.170" style="s2">other yeah yeah yeah I mean it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.000" end="01:11:25.640" style="s2">interesting especially that relationship</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.170" end="01:11:27.800" style="s2">between evolution and design right</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.640" end="01:11:31.970" style="s2">because you think about the way that</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.800" end="01:11:33.290" style="s2">like in the genotype and the the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.970" end="01:11:35.540" style="s2">fundamental transmission of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.290" end="01:11:38.990" style="s2">information that&#39;s encoded in me it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.540" end="01:11:40.760" style="s2">very distinct discrete state right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.990" end="01:11:43.250" style="s2">a propositional state of genetic code</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.760" end="01:11:45.290" style="s2">which is an expressed through you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.250" end="01:11:46.700" style="s2">some series of magical transformations</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.290" end="01:11:49.520" style="s2">into a layer which is no longer</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.700" end="01:11:53.510" style="s2">essentially propositional right it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.520" end="01:11:55.490" style="s2">this embodied perspectival musical</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.510" end="01:11:58.220" style="s2">quality that&#39;s the coordination of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.490" end="01:12:01.640" style="s2">vast sea of kind of orchestrated cycles</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.220" end="01:12:04.580" style="s2">and and that that is in fact the place</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.640" end="01:12:07.700" style="s2">where the testing of that propositional</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.580" end="01:12:10.700" style="s2">code embedded in the DNA occurs my</p>

<p begin="01:12:10.700" end="01:12:15.680" style="s2">expression of that drawing right is the</p>

<p begin="01:12:15.680" end="01:12:18.200" style="s2">right right exactly I&#39;ve actually hold</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.240" end="01:12:20.660" style="s2">on to that like the chart that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.200" end="01:12:22.430" style="s2">beautiful to transition from the what is</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.660" end="01:12:23.780" style="s2">effectively the phenomenal touches the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.430" end="01:12:26.360" style="s2">new mineral by going through that</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.780" end="01:12:27.680" style="s2">transition and if it doesn&#39;t go through</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.360" end="01:12:29.330" style="s2">that transition it doesn&#39;t actually get</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.680" end="01:12:30.830" style="s2">a checksum which is the thing that makes</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.330" end="01:12:34.040" style="s2">it possible to go through this thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.830" end="01:12:35.540" style="s2">fitness and the other one that came to</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.040" end="01:12:37.220" style="s2">mind as we&#39;re talking is the experience</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.540" end="01:12:39.350" style="s2">of the transition for quantity to</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.220" end="01:12:41.030" style="s2">quality that is actually very all in</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.350" end="01:12:45.050" style="s2">place which is what happens when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.030" end="01:12:45.889" style="s2">take rhythm EPM and you accelerate BPM</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.050" end="01:12:47.330" style="s2">into the ghost</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.889" end="01:12:51.170" style="s2">transition where our ear goes from</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.330" end="01:12:53.900" style="s2">hearing it as a linear quantity number</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.170" end="01:12:57.860" style="s2">of uniform beats that are happening in</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.900" end="01:12:59.420" style="s2">time through a quality a tone a note</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.860" end="01:13:02.330" style="s2">occurs and I&#39;m actually listening to</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.420" end="01:13:04.280" style="s2">middle C which of course is expressed in</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.330" end="01:13:05.719" style="s2">terms of Hertz right it actually can be</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.280" end="01:13:07.909" style="s2">thought of as being nothing more than a</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.719" end="01:13:09.500" style="s2">unity of quantity but there&#39;s almost as</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.909" end="01:13:10.610" style="s2">verticality where the horizontal</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.500" end="01:13:13.550" style="s2">dimension actually does become a</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.610" end="01:13:14.929" style="s2">vertical dimension and that fact the</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.550" end="01:13:16.190" style="s2">reality of the transition that you just</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.929" end="01:13:19.909" style="s2">talked about from the genetic code to</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.190" end="01:13:21.500" style="s2">the units that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.909" end="01:13:23.060" style="s2">talking about if we can hold that and</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.500" end="01:13:24.889" style="s2">find it would actually play within that</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.060" end="01:13:27.139" style="s2">space and DeLand started doing that with</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.889" end="01:13:29.830" style="s2">more thoughtfulness and intentionality</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.139" end="01:13:35.900" style="s2">then we&#39;re onto something</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.830" end="01:13:38.600" style="s2">agree all right so last question so from</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.900" end="01:13:41.030" style="s2">David how do you personally and I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.600" end="01:13:42.920" style="s2">to brought it out to broaden it to how</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.030" end="01:13:44.570" style="s2">would you recommend it for us to how</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.920" end="01:13:46.639" style="s2">would you figure out how to manage</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.570" end="01:13:49.219" style="s2">information and prioritize what to read</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.639" end="01:13:53.679" style="s2">learn with so much out there and not</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.219" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2"> to fall to information overwhelm I</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.679" end="01:14:00.940" style="s2">use magic but fortunately for me it</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:04.790" style="s2">turns out I that comes quite naturally I</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.940" end="01:14:06.710" style="s2">I think probably my sophomore year of</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.790" end="01:14:11.750" style="s2">college that I had an experienced it</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.710" end="01:14:14.239" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in place at that folks in</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.750" end="01:14:19.250" style="s2">particular physical books actually have</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.239" end="01:14:21.710" style="s2">a certain aesthetic quality to them so</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.250" end="01:14:28.489" style="s2">when I look at a title of a book it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.710" end="01:14:31.699" style="s2">have like a color or a taste and I what</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.489" end="01:14:33.260" style="s2">I noticed is that I had a certain if I</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.699" end="01:14:34.369" style="s2">if I attended to that I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.260" end="01:14:36.350" style="s2">allowed that to guide me in my</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.369" end="01:14:41.830" style="s2">allocation of attention it kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.350" end="01:14:45.320" style="s2">worked and so you know I gotta say like</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.830" end="01:14:48.679" style="s2">jij alloys on welded Londa tastes very</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.320" end="01:14:50.659" style="s2">much like Judah Lewis and so it was easy</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.679" end="01:14:52.310" style="s2">for me to know that within sentences of</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.659" end="01:14:53.989" style="s2">reading war in the age of intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.310" end="01:14:57.980" style="s2">machines that was going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.989" end="01:14:59.870" style="s2">delicious meal and you know and</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.980" end="01:15:02.810" style="s2">floured it and by contrast</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.870" end="01:15:03.980" style="s2">example it was it was simply intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.810" end="01:15:06.800" style="s2">with the case that as I was reading</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.980" end="01:15:11.750" style="s2">Hegel&#39;s phenomenology of spirit I was</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.800" end="01:15:14.210" style="s2">like yeah it has a lot of it feels heavy</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.750" end="01:15:16.070" style="s2">it feels very Germanic it feels</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.210" end="01:15:17.510" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of cream I&#39;m an upset</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.070" end="01:15:18.920" style="s2">stomach by the end of this and so I you</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.510" end="01:15:21.320" style="s2">know I read it but I could tell already</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.920" end="01:15:22.790" style="s2">that I was actually feeling myself just</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.320" end="01:15:24.020" style="s2">kind of sorting through it and scanning</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.790" end="01:15:27.560" style="s2">and looking for the little tiny pieces</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.020" end="01:15:29.510" style="s2">that did have a glow to them now you</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.560" end="01:15:30.920" style="s2">know what the hell is that mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.510" end="01:15:33.410" style="s2">good question to be perfectly honest I</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.920" end="01:15:36.440" style="s2">do not know but what I I can hypothesize</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.410" end="01:15:39.380" style="s2">that there&#39;s a again back to that felt</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.440" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">sense of rightness because reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.380" end="01:15:43.760" style="s2">as broad capacities vast evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:45.560" style="s2">capacity to like not get eaten by lions</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.760" end="01:15:48.740" style="s2">and to you know eat plants that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.560" end="01:15:51.280" style="s2">poison you that if you sort of put all</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.740" end="01:15:54.230" style="s2">of that to bear just allow the whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.280" end="01:15:55.910" style="s2">sensorium totality of all of your</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.230" end="01:15:58.310" style="s2">processing capacity that has been hone</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.910" end="01:16:00.200" style="s2">to protect you and to support you and to</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.310" end="01:16:02.270" style="s2">help you and then you allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.200" end="01:16:03.950" style="s2">use that to guide you that&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.270" end="01:16:05.500" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do like just analytically</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.950" end="01:16:07.490" style="s2">for sure that&#39;s the best you&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.500" end="01:16:09.410" style="s2">and so the challenge is kind of to say</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.490" end="01:16:12.320" style="s2">okay let me work backwards to me let me</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.410" end="01:16:13.970" style="s2">how can I most effectively use that and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">my guess is that in reality everybody</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.970" end="01:16:21.170" style="s2">actually has that just who or the most</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:22.370" style="s2">part we haven&#39;t trained ourselves and</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.170" end="01:16:24.260" style="s2">have not been trained certainly we have</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.370" end="01:16:27.790" style="s2">not been trained we haven&#39;t trained</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.260" end="01:16:31.250" style="s2">ourselves to those two resources to use</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.790" end="01:16:36.220" style="s2">but I would practice for example what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.250" end="01:16:38.960" style="s2">that called ash alright improvisation or</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.220" end="01:16:41.120" style="s2">her a particularly collaborative</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.960" end="01:16:43.520" style="s2">proposition because that felt sense of</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.120" end="01:16:45.320" style="s2">being able to get the flow of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.520" end="01:16:47.030" style="s2">being offered in the possibility of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.320" end="01:16:48.200" style="s2">conversation like that&#39;s the skill</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.030" end="01:16:49.700" style="s2">that&#39;s the technique right you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:16:49.700" end="01:16:53.330" style="s2">you can just like oh yeah okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.650" end="01:16:55.160" style="s2">seeing this particular conversation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.330" end="01:16:58.210" style="s2">reading this text I&#39;m feeling the quiz</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.160" end="01:17:00.080" style="s2">this sweet&#39;s about role in some gigantic</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.210" end="01:17:01.970" style="s2">improvisational play and I think of it</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.080" end="01:17:03.260" style="s2">as one huge field it&#39;s not a series of</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.970" end="01:17:05.480" style="s2">discrete opportunities to allocate your</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.260" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">attention it&#39;s a single moment and your</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.480" end="01:17:08.990" style="s2">job is to actually find this sweet spot</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:10.010" style="s2">in that single moment and so anything</p>

<p begin="01:20:04.329" end="01:20:10.780" style="s2">like a real number of people here and I</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.449" end="01:20:13.599" style="s2">also love the notion that there is this</p>

<p begin="01:20:16.570" end="01:20:22.960" style="s2">everywhere but something about that</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.639" end="01:20:25.929" style="s2">feels really right about the discovery</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.960" end="01:20:28.210" style="s2">and the emergence of people choosing to</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.929" end="01:20:30.820" style="s2">enter into deliberate and intentional in</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.210" end="01:20:32.679" style="s2">some cases hard one community that are</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.820" end="01:20:33.940" style="s2">distinct and yet able to then</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.679" end="01:20:35.380" style="s2">interrelate with each other like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.940" end="01:20:39.760" style="s2">feels like a very useful thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.380" end="01:20:42.730" style="s2">these dead yeah definitely and and tyler</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.760" end="01:20:45.780" style="s2">for example is very focused on sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.730" end="01:20:48.550" style="s2">bringing these communities together and</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.780" end="01:20:50.820" style="s2">sort of you know bridging bridging</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.550" end="01:20:53.590" style="s2">between them and a lot of our members</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.820" end="01:20:55.360" style="s2">you know we have overlap with with eric</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.590" end="01:20:57.099" style="s2">weinstein server with paul van der clays</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.360" end="01:21:00.010" style="s2">server with a lot of these with this</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.099" end="01:21:02.739" style="s2">with some stoah server so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.010" end="01:21:05.139" style="s2">of lot of over overlap and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.739" end="01:21:07.030" style="s2">definitely trying to to encourage this</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.139" end="01:21:09.610" style="s2">time I apologize I just had it I just</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.030" end="01:21:13.329" style="s2">had something coming to my mind I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.610" end="01:21:14.170" style="s2">to add is that okay yeah of course it</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.329" end="01:21:17.079" style="s2">has to do with this question of</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.170" end="01:21:19.329" style="s2">information over well so this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.079" end="01:21:23.340" style="s2">actually very practical one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.329" end="01:21:25.599" style="s2">things that I have built as a technique</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.340" end="01:21:28.860" style="s2">when answering the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.599" end="01:21:28.860" style="s2">information overwhelm is</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.829" end="01:21:38.829" style="s2">do you go up or to go in</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.050" end="01:21:41.769" style="s2">oh well then in particular event is</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.829" end="01:21:42.730" style="s2">occurring I mean we could just pick</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.769" end="01:21:46.329" style="s2">anything but school it&#39;s like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.730" end="01:21:48.400" style="s2">know coronavirus Cove it I and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.329" end="01:21:49.570" style="s2">large amount of information particularly</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.400" end="01:21:52.510" style="s2">lot of information that&#39;s at the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.570" end="01:21:54.909" style="s2">kind of pissed on a logical level you</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.510" end="01:21:59.980" style="s2">know epidemiology information for</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.909" end="01:22:02.980" style="s2">example what I find is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.980" end="01:22:04.059" style="s2">way of noticing when you&#39;ve reached a</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.980" end="01:22:06.579" style="s2">point where you almost get like</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.059" end="01:22:11.230" style="s2">diminishing returns continuing to</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.579" end="01:22:13.510" style="s2">operate at that level and and then the</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.230" end="01:22:14.920" style="s2">right answer and by the way you can say</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.510" end="01:22:16.059" style="s2">it I&#39;m beginning to feel information</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.920" end="01:22:17.920" style="s2">overwhelm like that&#39;s maybe a good way</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.059" end="01:22:19.869" style="s2">of noticing it and then there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.920" end="01:22:23.619" style="s2">a that she&#39;s gonna go up or in so up</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.869" end="01:22:26.739" style="s2">would be like and if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.619" end="01:22:27.789" style="s2">like geometry you could you think about</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.739" end="01:22:29.980" style="s2">it from the point view of a higher level</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.789" end="01:22:31.929" style="s2">geometry like are there is there a</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.980" end="01:22:33.849" style="s2">topological way of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.929" end="01:22:35.590" style="s2">entire thing I don&#39;t have to worry about</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.849" end="01:22:37.119" style="s2">the lot of information I can actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.590" end="01:22:38.889" style="s2">collapse all of that down to a single</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.119" end="01:22:42.849" style="s2">point this is something that Eric</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.889" end="01:22:44.199" style="s2">Weinstein is comprehensively good at and</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.849" end="01:22:45.909" style="s2">then there&#39;s in let&#39;s just say let me</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.199" end="01:22:47.889" style="s2">just actually move entirely from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.909" end="01:22:50.079" style="s2">informational domain and just</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.889" end="01:22:52.719" style="s2">contemplate you just sort of multiple</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.079" end="01:22:55.150" style="s2">shoe on this thing and not even trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.719" end="01:22:57.670" style="s2">to be in a relationship with it at all</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.150" end="01:22:59.650" style="s2">in the informational domain then notice</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.670" end="01:23:02.380" style="s2">if anything comes up that has that</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.650" end="01:23:05.340" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a felt sense of ha or</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.380" end="01:23:08.230" style="s2">some shift has occurred or an insight</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.340" end="01:23:10.449" style="s2">and generally speaking if I find myself</p>
