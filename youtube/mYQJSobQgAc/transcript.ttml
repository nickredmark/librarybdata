<p begin="00:00:46.710" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">available I don&#39;t know how many are left</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">but we certainly think it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">great idea for people to sign up we will</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:59.940" style="s2">provide a link to sign up you can also</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">look at our Twitter feeds and we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.940" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">each broadcast the announcement this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">able to put the screen up for just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">minute for my computer this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.409" end="00:01:11.610" style="s2">be I think quite an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">presentation for people we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.610" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">cover some deep issues in the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">consciousness we are gonna provide a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">model and because this is going to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:23.820" style="s2">James Madison program and it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:26.340" style="s2">broadcast publicly this will all be done</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.820" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">in English rather than science ease so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.340" end="00:01:32.189" style="s2">people who are interested in that topic</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">but fear that we may end up in a mode</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.189" end="00:01:36.509" style="s2">that is difficult to understand I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.509" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">every intention of making this</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">presentation off the hook and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">for our young viewers off-the-hook is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">reference to phones and what it means is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:50.310" style="s2">in the old days used to come in the door</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">and you would hang your phone on a hook</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">also phones were the size size of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">Volkswagens so it was a very different</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:01.890" style="s2">world all true all true yeah by the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">we have a question which is what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">hell are we gonna wear for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">presentation for a Princeton audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">when we&#39;re streaming from here our usual</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">mode isn&#39;t gonna work isn&#39;t it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:15.930" style="s2">think so because</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:19.890" style="s2">ordinarily you have an audience like</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.930" end="00:02:23.490" style="s2">this maybe you for me I would maybe wear</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.890" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">a blazer and a tie right and jeans and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.490" end="00:02:26.910" style="s2">that way you know there&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:29.580" style="s2">formal note in an informal note and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.910" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">people can see what they need to see but</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.580" end="00:02:34.740" style="s2">online nobody sees that you&#39;re wearing</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">jeans it just kind of looks weird blazer</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.740" end="00:02:41.880" style="s2">and bandana that&#39;s a thought what I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:46.500" style="s2">thinking about was I could wear a suit</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.880" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">but no shirt oh yeah oh no no no okay I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.500" end="00:02:49.020" style="s2">don&#39;t think anyone should try to pull</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:51.060" style="s2">that off</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.020" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about this later okay all</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.060" end="00:02:56.430" style="s2">right other announcements</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">not as far as I know not as far as my</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.430" end="00:03:01.710" style="s2">technical problems resolved and we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">we can just do this yes if you out there</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.710" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">in our audience believe you know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:10.530" style="s2">the technical problems might be they all</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:13.320" style="s2">seem to be downstream of our PC either</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.530" end="00:03:16.170" style="s2">our internet connection or YouTube seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.320" end="00:03:17.640" style="s2">to be causing this discontinuity anyway</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.170" end="00:03:19.410" style="s2">we&#39;d be very interested to hear about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.640" end="00:03:22.350" style="s2">if there was a fix that you were aware</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.410" end="00:03:23.730" style="s2">of that you think we might not be all</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.350" end="00:03:26.610" style="s2">right all right should we go and do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.730" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">on to the content all right so we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.500" end="00:05:36.389" style="s2">of places with this specifically dr.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.650" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">Erickson the main the main guy sitting</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.389" end="00:05:39.330" style="s2">at the end of this long table they</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:40.580" style="s2">called a press conference so they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.330" end="00:05:42.449" style="s2">a bunch of journalists off screen</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.580" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">occasionally interrupt and occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.449" end="00:05:46.469" style="s2">asking questions but it&#39;s mostly these</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:51.570" style="s2">two guys you&#39;ve got dr. Erickson</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.469" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">specifically arguing that lockdowns and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.570" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">aggressive social distancing measures</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:59.430" style="s2">had no effect and he&#39;s comparing numbers</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:01.669" style="s2">from place to place specifically at some</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.430" end="00:06:04.490" style="s2">points he uses numbers from Norway</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.669" end="00:06:07.349" style="s2">California the entire state not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.490" end="00:06:09.030" style="s2">Kern County or Bakersfield and Sweden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.349" end="00:06:12.210" style="s2">he&#39;s got Norway California and Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.030" end="00:06:14.610" style="s2">Norway in California both have and had</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.210" end="00:06:17.340" style="s2">pretty restrictive lockdowns can of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.610" end="00:06:19.289" style="s2">course we know in California had the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.340" end="00:06:20.940" style="s2">first three or five counties to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.289" end="00:06:23.490" style="s2">implement lock downs at all in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.940" end="00:06:25.530" style="s2">California itself as a state went wet</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.490" end="00:06:27.240" style="s2">towards a pretty severe state of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.530" end="00:06:30.090" style="s2">lockdown pretty early as did Norway</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.240" end="00:06:31.320" style="s2">apparently and Sweden did not so we</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.090" end="00:06:33.509" style="s2">didn&#39;t I had a little bit of social</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.320" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">distancing but kept it schools open kept</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.509" end="00:06:35.510" style="s2">you know it kept a lot of things as</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.510" end="00:06:39.140" style="s2">and so Erickson says you know but look</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.910" end="00:06:41.270" style="s2">at the numbers there&#39;s basically no</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.140" end="00:06:42.620" style="s2">difference between them he says for</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.270" end="00:06:44.390" style="s2">instance and I&#39;m just gonna read through</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.620" end="00:06:46.220" style="s2">some of his numbers and then later we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.390" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">come back to his numbers shortly</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.220" end="00:06:54.230" style="s2">he says Sweden with no lockdown has</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:58.760" style="s2">15,000 15,000 plus cases 74,000 tests</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.230" end="00:07:00.860" style="s2">therefore 21 percent of the tests were</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.760" end="00:07:02.510" style="s2">positive in a population of about</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.860" end="00:07:03.980" style="s2">10-point for a million he says let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.510" end="00:07:06.200" style="s2">extrapolate out the data this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.980" end="00:07:08.540" style="s2">phrase he uses we&#39;ve got about two</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.200" end="00:07:11.060" style="s2">million cases in Sweden ok leave that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.540" end="00:07:12.830" style="s2">aside for the moment in Norway which</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.060" end="00:07:16.340" style="s2">does did have a lockdown there are a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.830" end="00:07:17.660" style="s2">little over 7,000 cases with 145,000</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.340" end="00:07:20.210" style="s2">tests if you&#39;re keeping track of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.660" end="00:07:21.890" style="s2">numbers that&#39;s twice as many tests and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.210" end="00:07:24.350" style="s2">only four point nine percent tested</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.890" end="00:07:26.990" style="s2">positive now that right there right away</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.350" end="00:07:29.990" style="s2">should be raising questions how is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.990" end="00:07:31.850" style="s2">that neighboring countries with similar</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.990" end="00:07:33.800" style="s2">cultures please forgive me Swedes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.850" end="00:07:35.600" style="s2">Norwegians for all of the differences</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.800" end="00:07:37.970" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there are but with relatively</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.600" end="00:07:40.190" style="s2">similar cultures how is it that you had</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.970" end="00:07:42.200" style="s2">21% testing positive in Sweden whereas</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.190" end="00:07:45.650" style="s2">only less than 5% were testing positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.200" end="00:07:48.350" style="s2">in Norway the clear best answer to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.650" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">is different testing protocols and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.350" end="00:07:53.060" style="s2">fact what we see is that Norway tested</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:55.010" style="s2">way more people in a population that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.060" end="00:07:56.840" style="s2">basically half the size of Sweden so</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.010" end="00:07:59.960" style="s2">they effectively tested four times the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:08:03.050" style="s2">number per capita of what of what Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.960" end="00:08:05.690" style="s2">tested extrapolating out again to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.050" end="00:08:07.600" style="s2">Erickson&#39;s language he&#39;s as well there</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.690" end="00:08:10.010" style="s2">must have been about 1.3 million cases</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.600" end="00:08:14.510" style="s2">and only 182 deaths</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.010" end="00:08:18.470" style="s2">okay so Norway 182 deaths Sweden 1765</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.510" end="00:08:22.640" style="s2">deaths he says let me find the actual</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.470" end="00:08:24.460" style="s2">quote from him he says the death camp</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.640" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">from Norway and that from Sweden is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.460" end="00:08:31.100" style="s2">statistically in significantly different</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:32.360" style="s2">he never shows any numbers I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.100" end="00:08:34.010" style="s2">never he never does any inferential</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.360" end="00:08:35.510" style="s2">statistics which is exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.010" end="00:08:38.270" style="s2">would need to do in order to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.510" end="00:08:40.760" style="s2">that there was a no difference between</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.270" end="00:08:42.349" style="s2">them and in fact we don&#39;t have the data</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.760" end="00:08:43.700" style="s2">with which to do inferential statistics</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.349" end="00:08:45.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t even have sufficient data to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.700" end="00:08:46.710" style="s2">you descriptive statistics which would</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.350" end="00:08:49.290" style="s2">be to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.710" end="00:08:54.650" style="s2">averages and standard deviations and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.290" end="00:08:57.870" style="s2">such so first issue with with just</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.650" end="00:09:04.020" style="s2">disingenuous math that is motivated by a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.870" end="00:09:07.700" style="s2">conclusion is Norway is testing many</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.020" end="00:09:10.500" style="s2">more people and so is getting a lower</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.700" end="00:09:13.590" style="s2">test positive positive testing rate as</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.500" end="00:09:15.630" style="s2">we would expect so assuming that those</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.590" end="00:09:18.300" style="s2">numbers four four point nine percent</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.630" end="00:09:20.100" style="s2">positive versus twenty one point twenty</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.300" end="00:09:23.100" style="s2">one percent positive and Sweden are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.100" end="00:09:24.930" style="s2">actual numbers is is very unlikely to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.100" end="00:09:27.330" style="s2">true one of those numbers at least is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.930" end="00:09:31.590" style="s2">likely to be wrong and given what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.330" end="00:09:33.030" style="s2">seeing in a lot of other cases it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.590" end="00:09:34.650" style="s2">likely to be that Sweden&#39;s numbers are</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.030" end="00:09:36.540" style="s2">wrong the idea that twenty one percent</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.650" end="00:09:38.250" style="s2">of the population is in fact infected is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.540" end="00:09:40.950" style="s2">more likely to be wrong but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.250" end="00:09:43.650" style="s2">matter if either one of those numbers is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.950" end="00:09:45.270" style="s2">wrong comparing them is like comparing</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.650" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">apples to Subarus</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.270" end="00:09:50.820" style="s2">so let&#39;s be clear though you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.630" end="00:09:52.530" style="s2">conjecturing that what we have going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.820" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">here is motivated reasoning when we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.530" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">clearly have going on here is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:10:02.730" style="s2">unjustified comparisons of two data sets</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:04.350" style="s2">that are not alike yes why we have that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.730" end="00:10:06.330" style="s2">we don&#39;t know but we do know that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.350" end="00:10:08.670" style="s2">video and many of you will have seen</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.330" end="00:10:11.100" style="s2">part or the whole thing in fact many</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.670" end="00:10:15.530" style="s2">people asked us to comment on it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.100" end="00:10:18.900" style="s2">the video very clearly advocates for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.530" end="00:10:21.270" style="s2">relaxation of the restrictions that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.900" end="00:10:23.400" style="s2">are living under with lockdown on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.270" end="00:10:26.910" style="s2">basis that it is not justified by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.400" end="00:10:29.250" style="s2">numbers and in fact points to a an</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.910" end="00:10:30.870" style="s2">analogy with the flu and makes the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.250" end="00:10:33.300" style="s2">argument that this is not so much more</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.870" end="00:10:37.320" style="s2">serious than the flu that we ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.300" end="00:10:39.870" style="s2">taking drastic action right so just the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.320" end="00:10:41.070" style="s2">other the the only other particular math</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.870" end="00:10:43.110" style="s2">point and there are several other points</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.070" end="00:10:44.550" style="s2">that that we want to get through here</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.110" end="00:10:46.140" style="s2">but with regard to the math there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:48.690" style="s2">many concerns he doesn&#39;t acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.140" end="00:10:49.770" style="s2">what false positives positives are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.690" end="00:10:52.200" style="s2">look like and how they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.770" end="00:10:53.820" style="s2">revealing the data and such but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.200" end="00:10:56.010" style="s2">different very different results from</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.820" end="00:10:57.210" style="s2">Norway and Sweden suggest that at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.010" end="00:10:58.380" style="s2">one of those numbers is wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.210" end="00:10:59.889" style="s2">therefore we can&#39;t be doing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.380" end="00:11:02.619" style="s2">comparison as he&#39;s trying to do them</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.889" end="00:11:07.209" style="s2">exactly as you just said Bret and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.619" end="00:11:09.850" style="s2">we have this death count in Norway being</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.209" end="00:11:14.259" style="s2">182 versus the death count in Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.850" end="00:11:16.389" style="s2">being 1765 with different background</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.259" end="00:11:18.309" style="s2">population numbers Sweden has roughly</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.389" end="00:11:22.089" style="s2">twice the number of people as Norway</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.019" end="00:11:41.189" style="s2">Authority so no no and no all right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.139" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">we bad math appeals to Authority and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.189" end="00:11:49.389" style="s2">it&#39;s all plagued by small n am I wrong</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.389" end="00:11:54.069" style="s2">you&#39;re not wrong inherently they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.129" end="00:11:55.449" style="s2">do a tiny number of testing oh I see if</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.069" end="00:11:56.919" style="s2">I can scroll back to fine you know one</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.449" end="00:12:00.509" style="s2">hundred and forty five thousand tests in</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.629" end="00:12:10.389" style="s2">there are a lot of problems with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.069" end="00:12:12.129" style="s2">math here but I would put small and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.389" end="00:12:14.619" style="s2">pretty low ungrazed to complaint maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.129" end="00:12:16.629" style="s2">better would be suspect and because we</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.619" end="00:12:18.519" style="s2">don&#39;t know the protocol that generated</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.629" end="00:12:20.110" style="s2">write these numbers so that&#39;s how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.519" end="00:12:23.619" style="s2">that&#39;s why you can&#39;t trust the</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.619" end="00:12:27.759" style="s2">rates but in terms of the death count</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.199" end="00:12:29.379" style="s2">and you have seen people argue oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.759" end="00:12:31.239" style="s2">there&#39;s some you know some places where</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.379" end="00:12:32.139" style="s2">deaths are being missed and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.239" end="00:12:34.119" style="s2">places for deaths are being</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.139" end="00:12:36.129" style="s2">misattributed to cope in nineteen where</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.119" end="00:12:39.069" style="s2">they should be attributed to something</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.129" end="00:12:41.019" style="s2">else maybe in both cases but I that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.069" end="00:12:43.660" style="s2">looks like more noise than some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.019" end="00:12:46.419" style="s2">a systemic error or a system systemic</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.660" end="00:12:48.759" style="s2">error error so the fact is he didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.419" end="00:12:50.230" style="s2">any statistics so he has no basis on</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.759" end="00:12:51.549" style="s2">which to say that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.230" end="00:12:54.879" style="s2">significantly different number of deaths</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.549" end="00:12:57.399" style="s2">and I did just a little bit of simple</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.399" end="00:13:00.669" style="s2">he&#39;s provided us and he also then talks</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.160" end="00:13:50.660" style="s2">means that Norway actually had an order</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.110" end="00:14:30.470" style="s2">and we are going to have to come out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.560" end="00:14:32.420" style="s2">lockdown and and deal with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.470" end="00:14:35.060" style="s2">people will die what they are claiming</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.420" end="00:14:37.579" style="s2">is that there&#39;s no difference in the</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.579" end="00:14:40.760" style="s2">there were lock downs and situations</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.760" end="00:14:45.860" style="s2">do is take the very numbers that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:47.660" style="s2">presented but they fail to do the actual</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.660" end="00:14:51.350" style="s2">needed to be done and see that actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.730" end="00:14:54.230" style="s2">of the three examples that they provide</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.350" end="00:14:56.209" style="s2">Sweden with no lock down had about an</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.230" end="00:14:58.190" style="s2">order of magnitude more deaths per</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.209" end="00:14:59.779" style="s2">capita than either Norway or California</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.190" end="00:15:01.310" style="s2">did which implemented lock downs early</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.779" end="00:15:02.660" style="s2">so we don&#39;t know that they failed to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.310" end="00:15:07.570" style="s2">the calculation we know they failed to</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.570" end="00:15:14.060" style="s2">we are left with a difficulty that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.970" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">have now begun to see comparisons that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.060" end="00:15:19.160" style="s2">correct for all of the hazards in these</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:21.529" style="s2">sorts of comparisons emerge in fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.160" end="00:15:23.270" style="s2">BuzzFeed of all places not my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.529" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">publication but BuzzFeed presented a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.270" end="00:15:27.450" style="s2">pretty good comparison</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:30.420" style="s2">between sweden and denmark and what it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.450" end="00:15:33.720" style="s2">did was it focused on I guess the term</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.420" end="00:15:35.490" style="s2">is excess deaths where in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.720" end="00:15:37.410" style="s2">time period from one year as compared to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.490" end="00:15:39.420" style="s2">the next within the same population and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.410" end="00:15:41.220" style="s2">the question is how many people would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.420" end="00:15:43.080" style="s2">expected to die during let&#39;s say January</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.220" end="00:15:45.900" style="s2">and how many people died during this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.080" end="00:15:47.490" style="s2">January and this controls for the oh but</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.900" end="00:15:49.320" style="s2">did they actually die of code 19 right</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.490" end="00:15:52.050" style="s2">it actually controls for almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.320" end="00:15:53.370" style="s2">everything because it compares two years</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.050" end="00:15:55.170" style="s2">and you could have two years that were</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.370" end="00:15:56.850" style="s2">wildly dissimilar but they won&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.170" end="00:15:59.880" style="s2">be wildly dissimilar all over the globe</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.850" end="00:16:01.170" style="s2">in the same direction you know to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.880" end="00:16:02.700" style="s2">extent that the weather is harsh or</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.170" end="00:16:05.580" style="s2">something and it has some little effect</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.700" end="00:16:06.660" style="s2">it will tend to be swamped out and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.580" end="00:16:08.910" style="s2">will go in different directions in</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.660" end="00:16:11.310" style="s2">different places but these the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.910" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">comparison between Sweden where my</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.310" end="00:16:19.140" style="s2">understanding is there basically was</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:20.340" style="s2">voluntary measures social distancing was</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.140" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">widespread</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.340" end="00:16:25.380" style="s2">there was no lockdown but people were</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:27.450" style="s2">basically making some effort not to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.380" end="00:16:29.100" style="s2">transmit the disease but they were not</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.450" end="00:16:32.400" style="s2">being required to behave in particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.100" end="00:16:34.770" style="s2">ways compared to Denmark where there was</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.400" end="00:16:37.530" style="s2">a lockdown actually shows a strong</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.770" end="00:16:39.720" style="s2">preference for Denmark&#39;s model based on</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.530" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">excess deaths that show up in Sweden and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.720" end="00:16:44.670" style="s2">not in Denmark so this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:47.580" style="s2">comparison is really important also I</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.670" end="00:16:51.420" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not all clean</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.580" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">New York has shown a massive rate of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.420" end="00:16:56.130" style="s2">excess deaths like a shocking number six</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:16:58.700" style="s2">times the number of deaths expected in</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.130" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">this time period something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.700" end="00:17:04.920" style="s2">you know what this points to is all that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:08.370" style="s2">we don&#39;t know about what the factors are</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.920" end="00:17:10.200" style="s2">that are causing this so there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.370" end="00:17:12.420" style="s2">question of when the virus actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.200" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">showed up in a particular place right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.420" end="00:17:15.870" style="s2">one of the nice things about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:17.550" style="s2">comparison with like Denmark and Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.870" end="00:17:19.890" style="s2">as you were just talking about or or</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.550" end="00:17:22.560" style="s2">Norway in Sweden so the years are</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.890" end="00:17:25.560" style="s2">geographically close enough that we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.560" end="00:17:27.780" style="s2">expect that more or less the virus</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.560" end="00:17:29.220" style="s2">showed up there at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.780" end="00:17:30.600" style="s2">climatic and weather conditions were</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.220" end="00:17:32.820" style="s2">more or less the same it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.600" end="00:17:36.750" style="s2">whereas in New York it seems New York</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.820" end="00:17:38.460" style="s2">like LA it seems that to be increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.750" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">apparent that actually the virus was</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:42.870" style="s2">there much earlier than anyone knew and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:45.690" style="s2">so even though California experienced</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.870" end="00:17:49.890" style="s2">pretty stringent lockdowns and New York</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.690" end="00:17:53.400" style="s2">City still does probably those those</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.890" end="00:17:54.510" style="s2">lockdowns just came too late to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.400" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">spread to the degree that they needed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.510" end="00:17:58.140" style="s2">stop it and so I mean we&#39;ll get back to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:00.120" style="s2">this but there was a question last time</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.140" end="00:18:03.059" style="s2">about India and what&#39;s going on in India</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.120" end="00:18:06.299" style="s2">one of the one of the likely answers is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.059" end="00:18:08.520" style="s2">it got there late I got there far later</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.299" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">than it did for much of the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.520" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">world after the rest of the world was</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:13.710" style="s2">already seeing it responding to an India</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:16.110" style="s2">could see the responses India could</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.710" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">implement stricter lock downs far</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.110" end="00:18:20.490" style="s2">earlier in a process even though it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:22.200" style="s2">later in the calendar year than other</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.490" end="00:18:23.669" style="s2">countries were doing it so you know time</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.200" end="00:18:25.380" style="s2">is not absolute with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.669" end="00:18:27.630" style="s2">responding to a virus shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.380" end="00:18:29.179" style="s2">different places at different times yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.630" end="00:18:31.830" style="s2">actually the map you showed last time</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.179" end="00:18:34.440" style="s2">gave you a time series for where it</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.830" end="00:18:36.090" style="s2">jumped which gap at what point and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.440" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">know in some places it jumped gaps</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.090" end="00:18:39.299" style="s2">multiple times in fact that will have</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:41.130" style="s2">been commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.299" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">so yes the clock didn&#39;t start at some</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.130" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">moment exactly I mean it did the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:47.220" style="s2">original clock right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:48.780" style="s2">original virus and there&#39;s no left from</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.220" end="00:18:51.240" style="s2">a bat or escaped from a lab you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.780" end="00:18:53.850" style="s2">whatever it was at some moment but</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.240" end="00:18:55.650" style="s2">beyond that it is now spreading we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.850" end="00:18:58.289" style="s2">got effectively an adaptive radiation of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.650" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">this virus and each fork is at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.289" end="00:19:02.429" style="s2">different moment in time in a different</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:03.690" style="s2">place in space yes comparing populations</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.429" end="00:19:05.340" style="s2">to each other the clocks start at</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.690" end="00:19:07.860" style="s2">different moments but as your original</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.340" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">point here was if you take two countries</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.860" end="00:19:13.950" style="s2">that are close together and have close</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">contact and it makes sense that their</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.950" end="00:19:17.640" style="s2">clock would start similarly and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:19.590" style="s2">therefore comparing one to the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.640" end="00:19:21.240" style="s2">might tell us something about behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.590" end="00:19:24.210" style="s2">at the very least what this seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.240" end="00:19:25.830" style="s2">telling us is that it is not a clear-cut</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.210" end="00:19:29.070" style="s2">case the way these doctors have</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.830" end="00:19:31.620" style="s2">presented it that argues in favor of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.070" end="00:19:35.659" style="s2">relaxation of these measures he said now</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.620" end="00:19:38.100" style="s2">I would say we do have to do the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.659" end="00:19:39.570" style="s2">analysis the kind of analysis that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.100" end="00:19:43.290" style="s2">are doing as many people are asking us</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.570" end="00:19:44.090" style="s2">to do the analysis that says at what</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.290" end="00:19:46.879" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.090" end="00:19:50.269" style="s2">are we willing to accept an excess</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.879" end="00:19:53.029" style="s2">number of deaths in exchange for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.269" end="00:19:55.099" style="s2">reboot of the economy for example so but</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.029" end="00:19:56.989" style="s2">that is not the analysis they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.099" end="00:19:59.960" style="s2">though as you know as I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.989" end="00:20:01.700" style="s2">point out they could be saying at what</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.960" end="00:20:04.279" style="s2">point do we need to accept an excess</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.700" end="00:20:05.299" style="s2">number of deaths because otherwise so</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.279" end="00:20:07.309" style="s2">many other things are going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.299" end="00:20:10.789" style="s2">that are going to cause excess deaths in</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.309" end="00:20:13.340" style="s2">other areas but they are actually hiding</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.789" end="00:20:15.169" style="s2">behind fake math and claiming that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.340" end="00:20:17.479" style="s2">the measures that have already been</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.169" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">implemented are not effective and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.479" end="00:20:23.570" style="s2">is quite a different a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:24.889" style="s2">approach and the reason to walk us</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.570" end="00:20:26.719" style="s2">through some numbers was to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.889" end="00:20:29.179" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually just not true</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.719" end="00:20:31.429" style="s2">and that if these guys are MDS and now</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.179" end="00:20:32.779" style="s2">you know successful entrepreneurs I hope</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.429" end="00:20:34.719" style="s2">that they actually can do the very</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.779" end="00:20:38.509" style="s2">simple math to know that in which case</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.719" end="00:20:41.239" style="s2">they&#39;re lying and we don&#39;t know that but</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.509" end="00:20:43.429" style="s2">it seems pretty clear that they could do</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.239" end="00:20:45.830" style="s2">the basic math that I just did yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.429" end="00:20:47.389" style="s2">mean we obviously have to be careful we</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.830" end="00:20:48.950" style="s2">have no idea what&#39;s motivating them the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.389" end="00:20:51.559" style="s2">fact that their reasoning appears</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.950" end="00:20:55.729" style="s2">motivated is an indictment of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.559" end="00:20:58.009" style="s2">analysis that they&#39;re doing and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.729" end="00:21:01.669" style="s2">that this was seen by some five million</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.009" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">people or so is important because let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.669" end="00:21:06.349" style="s2">put it this way lots of us are waiting</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:08.839" style="s2">to hear some message that resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.349" end="00:21:12.049" style="s2">our priors what we expect is going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.839" end="00:21:15.169" style="s2">and there we know there are millions of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.049" end="00:21:17.239" style="s2">people waiting to be told the danger is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.169" end="00:21:18.950" style="s2">past or it wasn&#39;t real to begin with and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.239" end="00:21:21.409" style="s2">it is time for us to go back to doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.950" end="00:21:23.049" style="s2">what we did and you know frankly I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.409" end="00:21:25.219" style="s2">we have to be sympathetic to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.049" end="00:21:27.289" style="s2">perspective you know you and I are lucky</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.219" end="00:21:29.509" style="s2">we live in a place where this isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.289" end="00:21:32.839" style="s2">terrible but we can easily imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.509" end="00:21:34.909" style="s2">desire to get back to me I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.839" end="00:21:37.309" style="s2">going here and as I said at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.909" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">beginning like like with the Santa Clara</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.309" end="00:21:41.809" style="s2">County paper the sural at the serologies</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:44.450" style="s2">paper that we&#39;ve talked about in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.809" end="00:21:47.019" style="s2">couple of life casts already I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.450" end="00:21:49.879" style="s2">that the methods and in this case the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.019" end="00:21:52.460" style="s2">message and the analysis being on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.879" end="00:21:54.859" style="s2">message are crap but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.460" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">that I disagree with everything in it so</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.859" end="00:22:00.260" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna get here too</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:03.049" style="s2">the many ways that I think actually some</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.260" end="00:22:05.929" style="s2">of what they&#39;re saying makes sense but</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.049" end="00:22:08.419" style="s2">they really undercut their message by</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.929" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">going about it in this disingenuous way</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.419" end="00:22:14.840" style="s2">well so we need a rubric and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:16.490" style="s2">my rubric I would guess it is yours is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.840" end="00:22:19.429" style="s2">that to the extent that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.490" end="00:22:21.070" style="s2">provides you an analysis that appears</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.429" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">motivated to a particular conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.070" end="00:22:25.340" style="s2">trying to sort through it and find the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:27.140" style="s2">wheat and separate it from the chaff</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.340" end="00:22:30.350" style="s2">does not make sense one should assume</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.140" end="00:22:32.690" style="s2">that a source that is motivated may be</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.350" end="00:22:37.279" style="s2">able to say things that you won&#39;t spot</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.690" end="00:22:38.870" style="s2">so I would just say to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.279" end="00:22:40.490" style="s2">what we&#39;re finding is that this analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.870" end="00:22:42.770" style="s2">does not stand up to scrutiny that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.490" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">already sends up enough red flag that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.770" end="00:22:45.740" style="s2">even if some of the points are right we</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">should probably find other sources for</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.740" end="00:22:49.720" style="s2">them so let&#39;s talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:56.210" style="s2">hypothesis driven versus data-driven</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.720" end="00:22:58.789" style="s2">science and which one of those this</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.210" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">analysis is if either we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.789" end="00:23:02.270" style="s2">alluded to both in this live stream a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:06.110" style="s2">few times</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.270" end="00:23:08.090" style="s2">in past episodes you want to you want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.110" end="00:23:10.100" style="s2">just riff a little bit about hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.090" end="00:23:11.630" style="s2">driven science what it is why we need it</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.100" end="00:23:15.169" style="s2">and what data driven science is by</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.630" end="00:23:16.399" style="s2">comparison sure so first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.169" end="00:23:19.190" style="s2">should know that you&#39;re about to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.399" end="00:23:22.429" style="s2">dragged into a kind of inside baseball</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.190" end="00:23:24.289" style="s2">discussion but you should probably stay</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.429" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">interested because virtually everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.289" end="00:23:29.210" style="s2">that matters it depends on getting this</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:31.159" style="s2">right and we&#39;ve lived in an era where we</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.210" end="00:23:32.809" style="s2">have increasingly gotten it wrong this</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.159" end="00:23:36.529" style="s2">is a perfect moment to discover the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.809" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">error science as you all remember from</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.529" end="00:23:40.309" style="s2">the chalkboard in grade school or</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:45.860" style="s2">wherever you first encountered it is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.309" end="00:23:47.899" style="s2">method that method has one value and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.860" end="00:23:49.370" style="s2">then it has a lot of costs and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.899" end="00:23:51.260" style="s2">argument of anybody who believes in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.370" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">method is that the costs are worth</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.260" end="00:23:55.640" style="s2">paying in order to get the value the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:59.539" style="s2">value is that it corrects for human</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.640" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">biases and what that means is that if</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.539" end="00:24:04.429" style="s2">you think something is true and you run</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:07.159" style="s2">a proper scientific experiment you will</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.429" end="00:24:09.020" style="s2">discover whether or not you were correct</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.159" end="00:24:09.910" style="s2">so to the extent that you are bias as</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.020" end="00:24:11.590" style="s2">it&#39;s true you will</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.910" end="00:24:14.110" style="s2">discover it&#39;s false if it&#39;s false if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.590" end="00:24:17.500" style="s2">do if you apply the method correctly but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.110" end="00:24:20.710" style="s2">the method actually has deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.500" end="00:24:23.380" style="s2">philosophical underpinnings and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.710" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">philosophical underpinnings basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:29.980" style="s2">require you will remember the method is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">you observe a pattern you hypothesize an</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.980" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">explanation for the pattern the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:36.820" style="s2">hypothesis makes predictions about what</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:38.890" style="s2">else would be true if the hypothesis was</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.820" end="00:24:40.450" style="s2">correct and then you run an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.890" end="00:24:43.980" style="s2">to see whether the predictions show up</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.450" end="00:24:46.690" style="s2">in some place that you look for them</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.980" end="00:24:49.750" style="s2">then the part that doesn&#39;t frequently</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.690" end="00:24:52.030" style="s2">get said is if the test turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.750" end="00:24:54.670" style="s2">reflect positively on the hypothesis if</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.030" end="00:24:57.460" style="s2">the predictions are right then the model</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.670" end="00:25:01.930" style="s2">that generated it gains strength in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.460" end="00:25:03.370" style="s2">belief in it and so basically there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.930" end="00:25:05.950" style="s2">a lot of ways this can go wrong we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.370" end="00:25:08.740" style="s2">seen the replication crisis take down</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.950" end="00:25:10.660" style="s2">entire fields who have generated a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:12.040" style="s2">library of beliefs that aren&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.660" end="00:25:14.200" style="s2">because there are ways that you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.040" end="00:25:15.460" style="s2">apply the method badly and what you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.200" end="00:25:17.050" style="s2">looks like science but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.460" end="00:25:19.480" style="s2">function like it doesn&#39;t correct for</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.050" end="00:25:21.820" style="s2">bias as it reinforces them especially in</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.480" end="00:25:23.470" style="s2">an era of really complicated statistics</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.820" end="00:25:25.870" style="s2">where most of the scientists doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.470" end="00:25:27.490" style="s2">analyses don&#39;t actually understand what</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.870" end="00:25:29.380" style="s2">the math is behind the statistics that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.490" end="00:25:30.970" style="s2">they&#39;re using are so they&#39;re black</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.970" end="00:25:34.600" style="s2">being pleasantly surprised when out pops</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.600" end="00:25:40.110" style="s2">they don&#39;t ask too many questions so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.090" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">upshot of this is the method is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.110" end="00:25:45.430" style="s2">incredibly sensitive to weather the</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:09.340" style="s2">is I would argue it&#39;s the final it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.340" end="00:26:12.760" style="s2">needs to work do we need to tinker the</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.760" end="00:26:17.410" style="s2">work a little bit er yes but if aliens</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.130" end="00:26:21.710" style="s2">step off the spaceship someday and say</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.410" end="00:26:23.899" style="s2">we&#39;d like to talk they will have</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.899" end="00:26:28.220" style="s2">we will be able to map our version onto</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.450" end="00:26:30.140" style="s2">there&#39;s maybe an interesting discussion</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.220" end="00:26:32.120" style="s2">to be had but they will be hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.140" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">testing they will be falsifying</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.120" end="00:26:36.710" style="s2">hypotheses rather than validating them</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:39.020" style="s2">they will do all the same things why</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.710" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">because it works and you can&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.020" end="00:26:46.429" style="s2">anything to replace it so I expect</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:49.250" style="s2">you&#39;ll then go to its challengers yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.429" end="00:26:50.690" style="s2">so just to pick up your example those</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.250" end="00:26:54.500" style="s2">aliens are not going to have gotten to</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.149" end="00:27:35.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not right data driven science is</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.070" end="00:27:38.179" style="s2">asking data to really reveal patterns</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.390" end="00:27:41.419" style="s2">that you did not predict and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.179" end="00:27:43.880" style="s2">what you get out of such queries is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.419" end="00:27:46.940" style="s2">hypothesis it is not a result it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.880" end="00:27:48.770" style="s2">often treated like it&#39;s a result and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.940" end="00:27:50.750" style="s2">this is how data-driven science actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.770" end="00:27:53.210" style="s2">you know makes makes its living it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.750" end="00:27:56.450" style="s2">queries it queries data says what do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.210" end="00:27:57.799" style="s2">see and then whatever is seen ends up</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.450" end="00:28:00.860" style="s2">being promoted as this is what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.799" end="00:28:03.830" style="s2">found and it is a kind of found but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.860" end="00:28:06.380" style="s2">found that hasn&#39;t been tested yet that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.830" end="00:28:07.940" style="s2">is effectively an observation which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.380" end="00:28:10.940" style="s2">something you&#39;ve said here before right</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.940" end="00:28:13.789" style="s2">so if you query data using an algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.940" end="00:28:15.500" style="s2">and you end up with oh I think this</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.789" end="00:28:17.779" style="s2">pattern but this pattern has revealed</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.500" end="00:28:19.640" style="s2">itself now what you need to do is go</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.779" end="00:28:21.830" style="s2">with a hypothesis that there&#39;s a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.640" end="00:28:24.409" style="s2">that exists into a different data set</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.830" end="00:28:25.909" style="s2">and ask those data if this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.409" end="00:28:27.470" style="s2">exists so I think this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.909" end="00:28:29.260" style="s2">very mysterious to people until we</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.470" end="00:28:31.880" style="s2">unpack it a little bit okay first</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.260" end="00:28:33.940" style="s2">data-driven when people say it when they</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.880" end="00:28:35.470" style="s2">assert this is data-driven science</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.940" end="00:28:38.769" style="s2">let&#39;s see what the data say the data are</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.470" end="00:28:40.899" style="s2">king right when people do that it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.769" end="00:28:45.009" style="s2">to somebody who has not been in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.899" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">trenches like an obvious appeal to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.009" end="00:28:50.110" style="s2">empirical right oh oh that is almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:52.059" style="s2">synonymous if I say data-driven science</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.110" end="00:28:54.309" style="s2">I&#39;m really just saying science with some</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.059" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">kind of emphasis on the empirical this</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.309" end="00:28:59.289" style="s2">is not what it is at all it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:29:01.629" style="s2">kind of coup from empirical meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.289" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">accountable the quantifiable yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.629" end="00:29:06.759" style="s2">quantifiable and very often the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:09.340" style="s2">experimental and we are not arguing</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.759" end="00:29:10.690" style="s2">against experiment or empiricism in fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.340" end="00:29:13.149" style="s2">it is absolutely essential for</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.690" end="00:29:14.679" style="s2">hypothesis driven science to be tested</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.149" end="00:29:18.190" style="s2">against the empirical that&#39;s what makes</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.679" end="00:29:20.440" style="s2">it work but if you sideline the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.190" end="00:29:23.409" style="s2">hypothetical and you simply go to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:25.389" style="s2">series of experiments what you are doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.409" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">is you are taking all of the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.389" end="00:29:29.470" style="s2">the method that aren&#39;t observation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:32.259" style="s2">eliminating them which then fails to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.470" end="00:29:35.320" style="s2">account for bias now the one or two</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.259" end="00:29:36.730" style="s2">correct for bias the one caveat that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.320" end="00:29:42.149" style="s2">would make and people like you and me</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.730" end="00:29:46.379" style="s2">hate this point and absolutely domestic</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.149" end="00:29:50.830" style="s2">hypothesis driven science could be done</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.379" end="00:29:53.740" style="s2">by a machine okay it could be done by a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.830" end="00:29:56.340" style="s2">machine on giant datasets and it would</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:58.809" style="s2">work now I don&#39;t think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.340" end="00:30:01.809" style="s2">artful I don&#39;t think we&#39;re in a place to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.809" end="00:30:04.750" style="s2">do it but I don&#39;t want to say that this</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.809" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">requires people to generate hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.750" end="00:30:10.269" style="s2">it could be done in a in a mechanistic</p>

<p begin="00:32:45.940" end="00:32:52.509" style="s2">to do data-driven science they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.039" end="00:32:55.470" style="s2">accidentally acknowledging that they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.509" end="00:32:57.879" style="s2">not doing hypothetical deductive science</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.470" end="00:33:00.070" style="s2">but in fact it doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.879" end="00:33:02.499" style="s2">high-quality data either it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.070" end="00:33:03.850" style="s2">right it seems and you know this is I</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.499" end="00:33:07.419" style="s2">don&#39;t know that anyone else is calling</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.850" end="00:33:09.429" style="s2">at this but the the three-part solution</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.419" end="00:33:10.749" style="s2">set that I was thinking of and watching</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.429" end="00:33:14.109" style="s2">this video was well it&#39;s clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.749" end="00:33:15.399" style="s2">hypothesis driven they clearly I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.109" end="00:33:17.320" style="s2">sure they would recognize a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.399" end="00:33:19.690" style="s2">if it hit them in the head but they</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.320" end="00:33:21.549" style="s2">seemed have facility and really liked</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.690" end="00:33:23.259" style="s2">the idea of data but this looks like its</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.549" end="00:33:24.940" style="s2">conclusion driven they have a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.259" end="00:33:26.229" style="s2">they like they&#39;re fitting what they find</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.940" end="00:33:28.659" style="s2">at that conclusion no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.229" end="00:33:30.220" style="s2">excluding stuff that doesn&#39;t fit talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.659" end="00:33:33.970" style="s2">about the things that does fit that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.220" end="00:33:35.859" style="s2">actively anti-scientific it it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.970" end="00:33:38.769" style="s2">really be farther from an actual</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.859" end="00:33:40.570" style="s2">scientific approach yep mmm okay so let</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.769" end="00:33:44.679" style="s2">us um just walk through a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.570" end="00:33:48.580" style="s2">more in the video before talking a bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.679" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">about what points they make that the do</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.580" end="00:33:52.330" style="s2">make sense or that are related</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:54.279" style="s2">what would important things we know</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.330" end="00:33:56.229" style="s2">about what this is what kind of have it</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.279" end="00:34:00.669" style="s2">this is wreaking that it related to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.229" end="00:34:02.979" style="s2">points they&#39;re making they just tossed</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.669" end="00:34:05.590" style="s2">it they&#39;re making internally</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.979" end="00:34:07.059" style="s2">inconsistent arguments for instance they</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.590" end="00:34:08.589" style="s2">say that not everyone should wear a mask</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.059" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">because you won&#39;t get your good flora</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.589" end="00:34:18.010" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get your immune</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:19.329" style="s2">response yeah yeah they did so so they</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.010" end="00:34:21.129" style="s2">argue that we need exposure to pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.329" end="00:34:26.409" style="s2">in order to strengthen the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.129" end="00:34:28.329" style="s2">quote that&#39;s just basic immunology sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.409" end="00:34:30.760" style="s2">of but not on that time scale I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.329" end="00:34:32.349" style="s2">you that much yeah so I kind of made a</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.760" end="00:34:34.179" style="s2">point of not telling you that particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.349" end="00:34:38.309" style="s2">thing from the video until so I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.179" end="00:34:41.500" style="s2">have that reaction on on film yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.309" end="00:34:43.059" style="s2">then they say I mean this this is really</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.500" end="00:34:46.329" style="s2">totally remarkable to me and I am</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.059" end="00:34:49.450" style="s2">imagining a goal in what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.329" end="00:34:51.339" style="s2">that may not be fair but they predict</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.450" end="00:34:53.799" style="s2">that because they are saying everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.339" end="00:34:55.329" style="s2">masked and so no one is getting the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.799" end="00:34:56.619" style="s2">immunity that they need and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.329" end="00:34:59.500" style="s2">when the lock downs are lifted</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.619" end="00:35:01.390" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna get sick so they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.500" end="00:35:05.950" style="s2">predicted massive sickness having an</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.390" end="00:35:08.140" style="s2">essence you with kovat 19 by claiming</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.950" end="00:35:10.150" style="s2">that that&#39;s just basic immunology when</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.140" end="00:35:10.470" style="s2">that isn&#39;t basic immunology not on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.150" end="00:35:12.180" style="s2">sky</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.470" end="00:35:14.520" style="s2">not on that scale and you have two</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.180" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">competing things even to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.520" end="00:35:17.970" style="s2">your immune system might be able to pick</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:20.130" style="s2">up exposure to some things at a level</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.970" end="00:35:21.750" style="s2">that you don&#39;t get sick you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.130" end="00:35:23.339" style="s2">being exposed to many things that do</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.750" end="00:35:26.099" style="s2">cause you to get sick that you won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.339" end="00:35:27.420" style="s2">exposed to if it moves to summer and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.099" end="00:35:28.710" style="s2">those things aren&#39;t circulating and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.420" end="00:35:32.670" style="s2">you&#39;re not wearing a mask at that point</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.710" end="00:35:35.180" style="s2">so anyway that&#39;s that certainly I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.670" end="00:35:37.740" style="s2">say consistent with the hypothesis of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.180" end="00:35:39.480" style="s2">motivated reasoning because they just</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.740" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">cherry picked the part of that argument</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.480" end="00:35:44.460" style="s2">that they liked and excluded the part</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:47.430" style="s2">that goes in the other direction yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.460" end="00:35:50.520" style="s2">then they also say we also complaining</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.430" end="00:35:52.050" style="s2">about you buy things at Lowe&#39;s they say</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.520" end="00:35:53.130" style="s2">you can go to Lowe&#39;s you buy things and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.050" end="00:35:54.420" style="s2">you bring them into your home and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.130" end="00:35:56.310" style="s2">not blocking transmission of all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.420" end="00:35:58.980" style="s2">fomites fomites being there jarred they</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.310" end="00:36:01.380" style="s2">like to use jargon of course to fomites</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.980" end="00:36:03.510" style="s2">being all of the little viral particles</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.380" end="00:36:05.400" style="s2">that might get you sick so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.510" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">complaining about the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.400" end="00:36:10.920" style="s2">might bring home that have viral</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:12.750" style="s2">particles on them and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.920" end="00:36:14.280" style="s2">saying that everyone being messed up is</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.750" end="00:36:16.980" style="s2">going to prevent them prevent you from</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.280" end="00:36:19.079" style="s2">getting any kind of immune response that</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.980" end="00:36:21.300" style="s2">you need so I would ask them which is it</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.079" end="00:36:22.530" style="s2">which is it guys we shouldn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.300" end="00:36:24.540" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t wear masks because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.530" end="00:36:25.170" style="s2">fully protective and or because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.540" end="00:36:27.930" style="s2">too protective</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.170" end="00:36:29.550" style="s2">like if you&#39;re arguing both and I&#39;ve and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.930" end="00:36:31.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen what looked like good faith</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.550" end="00:36:34.710" style="s2">arguments on both of those you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.710" end="00:36:35.910" style="s2">wear masks well actually have not seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.710" end="00:36:37.890" style="s2">because they&#39;re too productive but</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.910" end="00:36:39.990" style="s2">because they&#39;re not fully protective I</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.890" end="00:36:41.579" style="s2">think it&#39;s a stupid argument but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.990" end="00:36:44.250" style="s2">seen people make that argument in good</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.579" end="00:36:46.109" style="s2">faith but these guys seem to be making</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.250" end="00:36:46.950" style="s2">both arguments simultaneously you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.109" end="00:36:48.599" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t wear them because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.950" end="00:36:50.099" style="s2">protective enough and because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.599" end="00:36:52.230" style="s2">you&#39;re protective and if you&#39;re arguing</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.099" end="00:36:54.030" style="s2">for both of those positions it seems</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.230" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">pretty clear than you&#39;re arguing for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.030" end="00:36:58.380" style="s2">conclusion rather than trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:01.020" style="s2">out what&#39;s true so that&#39;s just one</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.020" end="00:37:12.180" style="s2">arguments and let&#39;s do one more set of</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.460" end="00:39:00.059" style="s2">say that we could argue for instance</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.480" end="00:39:02.430" style="s2">that humans didn&#39;t exist 600 million 6</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.059" end="00:39:04.500" style="s2">million years ago and our most recent</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.430" end="00:39:07.890" style="s2">common Astor&#39;s ancestor which was</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.500" end="00:39:10.920" style="s2">something some proto chimp bonobo human</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.890" end="00:39:12.450" style="s2">thing did saying that 6 million years</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.920" end="00:39:15.779" style="s2">ago we didn&#39;t exist doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.450" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">humans don&#39;t exist now so you know this</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.779" end="00:39:20.579" style="s2">virus had never met us 6 months ago and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:24.410" style="s2">that&#39;s true but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.579" end="00:39:27.059" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t exist now so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.410" end="00:39:29.730" style="s2">the truth changes every two hours I</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.059" end="00:39:32.099" style="s2">think is a cute way of saying what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.730" end="00:39:34.529" style="s2">believe to be true is rapidly changing</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.099" end="00:39:36.539" style="s2">which is so I think it is - but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.529" end="00:39:40.119" style="s2">wrapped in this appeal to Authority</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.539" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">yes and I would say to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.119" end="00:39:45.880" style="s2">he&#39;s making that argument that argument</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:47.980" style="s2">goes in the other direction which is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.880" end="00:39:49.779" style="s2">would err in the direction of caution</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.980" end="00:39:53.109" style="s2">with something this potentially lethal</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.779" end="00:39:55.150" style="s2">where the truth had not settled down to</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.109" end="00:39:57.099" style="s2">the point that we could even formulate a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.150" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">high-quality consensus on lots of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.099" end="00:40:02.859" style="s2">basic issues about how its transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:04.809" style="s2">why it&#39;s particularly virulent in some</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.859" end="00:40:07.510" style="s2">people and asymptomatic and others why</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.809" end="00:40:10.420" style="s2">it can be asymptomatic and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.510" end="00:40:12.460" style="s2">seem and you you can still have damage</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.420" end="00:40:14.920" style="s2">sufficient to show up on a CT scan of</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.460" end="00:40:17.710" style="s2">your lungs weeks later things like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.920" end="00:40:20.260" style="s2">so the basics have not been established</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.710" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">that suggests we should be very very</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.260" end="00:40:25.299" style="s2">cautious there are some extremely</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">dangerous possibilities that we have yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.299" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">to rule out here and until we have ruled</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:31.660" style="s2">them out we should behave as if they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:35.140" style="s2">still live possibilities because they</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.660" end="00:40:37.750" style="s2">are so the truth changes every two hours</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.140" end="00:40:39.430" style="s2">maybe but if so then the argument you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.750" end="00:40:41.589" style="s2">making doesn&#39;t fit because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.430" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">conclusion would be lethal or</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.589" end="00:40:48.099" style="s2">potentially so he also says who knows</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">what&#39;s safe for you you or the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.099" end="00:40:52.299" style="s2">government they are trying to control</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:54.130" style="s2">you well they may be trying to control</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.299" end="00:40:55.660" style="s2">you they certainly seem to be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.130" end="00:40:58.510" style="s2">control us in some regards but this</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.660" end="00:41:00.849" style="s2">again makes this error that we alluded</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.510" end="00:41:02.260" style="s2">to in our last livestream of conflating</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.849" end="00:41:04.900" style="s2">the individual with the population</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.260" end="00:41:08.500" style="s2">public health is inherently about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.900" end="00:41:10.990" style="s2">population and we are asking the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.500" end="00:41:13.299" style="s2">population and all of its members to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.990" end="00:41:17.079" style="s2">something to protect everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.299" end="00:41:21.160" style="s2">population individual decisions cannot</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.079" end="00:41:23.170" style="s2">be the only thing that we are behaving</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.160" end="00:41:25.299" style="s2">based on that is this is what government</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.170" end="00:41:28.210" style="s2">is for in order to make decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.299" end="00:41:32.529" style="s2">are that have that effect more than</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.210" end="00:41:34.930" style="s2">individuals and that can be used to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.529" end="00:41:36.309" style="s2">us to do what we need to do when the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.930" end="00:41:38.049" style="s2">problems are bigger than individual</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.309" end="00:41:40.029" style="s2">level problems so another way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.049" end="00:41:41.890" style="s2">that is that if everybody makes the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.029" end="00:41:44.410" style="s2">decision that is right for them it does</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.890" end="00:41:46.420" style="s2">not produce the same thing that we would</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.410" end="00:41:48.839" style="s2">come to if we did an analysis over</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.420" end="00:41:50.309" style="s2">what&#39;s best for the population and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.839" end="00:41:52.170" style="s2">particularly dangerous when different</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.309" end="00:41:55.529" style="s2">people face different hazards in other</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.170" end="00:41:57.960" style="s2">words it might be that some doctors in</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.529" end="00:42:00.239" style="s2">Kern County would actually be much</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.960" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">better off if the lockdown was to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.239" end="00:42:06.950" style="s2">lifted but it might cost lots of lives</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:09.329" style="s2">in other places and so I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:12.239" style="s2">most doctors would not consciously</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.329" end="00:42:14.130" style="s2">accept that trade-off but they might</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.239" end="00:42:17.219" style="s2">talk themselves into an argument that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.130" end="00:42:19.289" style="s2">would result in that kind of transfer of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.219" end="00:42:21.900" style="s2">well-being from one population to</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.289" end="00:42:23.999" style="s2">another and so the one force that can</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.900" end="00:42:26.009" style="s2">deal with that conflict between the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.999" end="00:42:30.869" style="s2">individual level and the population</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.009" end="00:42:34.430" style="s2">level is a government built to speak for</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.869" end="00:42:36.900" style="s2">the public interest now the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.430" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">our government is not very well equipped</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.900" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">to do that our government has become</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:46.259" style="s2">corrupt and inept and so it has done a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:49.259" style="s2">terrible job with kovat 19 but that said</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.259" end="00:42:52.799" style="s2">it has done a much better job than it</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.259" end="00:42:59.190" style="s2">might have mm-hmm how is that could you</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.799" end="00:43:00.869" style="s2">give me my computer back Thanks sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.190" end="00:43:04.529" style="s2">lost track there no that&#39;s all right yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.869" end="00:43:06.539" style="s2">more technical problems okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.529" end="00:43:09.809" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.539" end="00:43:11.309" style="s2">what they bring up that that maybe make</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.809" end="00:43:13.109" style="s2">some sense so can I ask you a question</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.309" end="00:43:17.940" style="s2">yeah I think we need to be careful in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.109" end="00:43:20.849" style="s2">doing this we should just say it is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.940" end="00:43:22.920" style="s2">actually the obligation of an analysis</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.849" end="00:43:26.039" style="s2">that discovers a motivated set of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.920" end="00:43:27.539" style="s2">reasoning to find the good at the point</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.039" end="00:43:29.789" style="s2">you found a motivated set of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.539" end="00:43:32.729" style="s2">it may be just simply the right thing to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.789" end="00:43:35.279" style="s2">do to walk away now maybe you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.729" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">reasons to raise things that they raise</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.279" end="00:43:38.700" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think I mean as you already</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:40.289" style="s2">did like you were you already doing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.700" end="00:43:41.430" style="s2">lot of this and I want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.289" end="00:43:42.690" style="s2">I get to the rest of the points that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.430" end="00:43:46.890" style="s2">you&#39;ve already brought up here all right</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.690" end="00:43:49.019" style="s2">right so they point out the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.890" end="00:43:50.339" style="s2">delaying other medical procedures may</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.019" end="00:43:52.019" style="s2">cause an increase in mortality and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.339" end="00:43:53.249" style="s2">morbidity for other medical reasons we</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.019" end="00:43:55.109" style="s2">actually brought this up on one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.249" end="00:43:57.509" style="s2">last two live streams yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.109" end="00:43:59.369" style="s2">it&#39;s probably true that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.509" end="00:44:01.870" style="s2">financial interest in making this point</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.369" end="00:44:03.970" style="s2">because what they do is they all</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.870" end="00:44:05.560" style="s2">and run seven urgent care clinics which</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.970" end="00:44:07.960" style="s2">mostly aren&#39;t dealing with kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.560" end="00:44:09.550" style="s2">patients and mostly other people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.960" end="00:44:11.470" style="s2">standing away from health care at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.550" end="00:44:13.930" style="s2">moment and so they&#39;re probably taking a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.470" end="00:44:16.870" style="s2">financial hit I&#39;m I&#39;m imagining that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.930" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">that is true but even even if this is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.870" end="00:44:22.270" style="s2">message from which they would personally</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:24.700" style="s2">financially benefit if people could hear</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.270" end="00:44:26.530" style="s2">it that doesn&#39;t make it untrue people</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.700" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">delaying other medical procedures may</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.530" end="00:44:30.520" style="s2">put them at greater risk and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:34.690" style="s2">most people are avoiding other medical</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.520" end="00:44:36.340" style="s2">procedures another thing that is true</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.690" end="00:44:38.320" style="s2">and this is exactly where you were going</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.340" end="00:44:42.520" style="s2">earlier is the slowly lifting lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.320" end="00:44:43.950" style="s2">makes sense in many regards in many many</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.520" end="00:44:46.630" style="s2">places at this point I would say</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.950" end="00:44:50.170" style="s2">including where we are in Portland</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.630" end="00:44:52.390" style="s2">Oregon but there&#39;s this question that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.170" end="00:44:54.610" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering about and have been since</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.390" end="00:44:57.100" style="s2">since people have started talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.610" end="00:44:58.690" style="s2">study lifting lockdown is schools are</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.100" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">close to the fall in many many places</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.690" end="00:45:05.530" style="s2">including I think in the entire west</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:07.960" style="s2">coast of the United States so what if</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.530" end="00:45:09.790" style="s2">other expectations around work and such</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.960" end="00:45:12.010" style="s2">resume what are parents with school-age</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.790" end="00:45:13.420" style="s2">children going to do rural care kids are</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.010" end="00:45:15.340" style="s2">old enough they&#39;re in school but you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.420" end="00:45:17.620" style="s2">know we would do fine so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.340" end="00:45:19.210" style="s2">actually arguing at this point for you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.620" end="00:45:21.700" style="s2">know what are we going to do but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.210" end="00:45:24.580" style="s2">of people with young kids if the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.700" end="00:45:26.290" style="s2">lockdown start to lift and these are you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.580" end="00:45:29.560" style="s2">know people with jobs that haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.290" end="00:45:31.510" style="s2">able to go to work for four weeks or six</p>

<p begin="00:46:55.110" end="00:46:59.610" style="s2">sucked like such a ray of hope but it</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.780" end="00:47:04.260" style="s2">was really bleak lancing extraordinary</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.260" end="00:47:08.910" style="s2">could be a pattern but just like are you</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.910" end="00:47:15.710" style="s2">I mean maybe but let&#39;s put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.490" end="00:47:18.990" style="s2">the radical variants that we see between</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.710" end="00:47:21.750" style="s2">localities between environments you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.990" end="00:47:24.300" style="s2">indoor versus outdoor look there is no</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.750" end="00:47:26.850" style="s2">way it is possible that this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.300" end="00:47:29.070" style="s2">very hard to transmit outdoors it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.850" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">possible that it never happens right</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.070" end="00:47:34.290" style="s2">right so because even the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:36.600" style="s2">hard to define outdoors in a precise way</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.290" end="00:47:38.700" style="s2">that absolutely takes everything out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.600" end="00:47:39.720" style="s2">the gray area means that this this</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.700" end="00:47:44.370" style="s2">cannot be true</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.720" end="00:47:46.620" style="s2">so children may be unlikely a rare case</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.370" end="00:47:51.720" style="s2">may have a lot of people downstream of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.620" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">it and so we can&#39;t ignore it but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.720" end="00:47:56.220" style="s2">there there are two things I think need</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">to be said here one the issue of is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.220" end="00:48:02.490" style="s2">time to lift the lockdown in some places</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:04.620" style="s2">I am so worried about this and as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.490" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">pointed out we&#39;re in Oregon Oregon has a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.620" end="00:48:09.630" style="s2">very low infection rate and a low death</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.090" style="s2">rate but sandwiched between two states</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.630" end="00:48:13.650" style="s2">with high right high rates I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.090" end="00:48:14.790" style="s2">point would be if you were gonna raise</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.650" end="00:48:17.430" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna lift the lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.790" end="00:48:19.320" style="s2">somewhere we&#39;d be benefiting from it</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.430" end="00:48:21.660" style="s2">because we&#39;d be one of the states where</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.320" end="00:48:23.370" style="s2">it made the most sense but I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.660" end="00:48:25.830" style="s2">worried about the game theory that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.370" end="00:48:27.510" style="s2">unfolds as part of the the country</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.830" end="00:48:31.290" style="s2">remains in lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.510" end="00:48:34.710" style="s2">part of it is not I must say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.290" end="00:48:36.660" style="s2">know what happens when a state is locked</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.710" end="00:48:39.260" style="s2">down and its adjacent state isn&#39;t locked</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.660" end="00:48:42.030" style="s2">down I mean what happens to the states</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.260" end="00:48:45.300" style="s2">in and around New York if New York</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.030" end="00:48:47.880" style="s2">remains on lockdown for I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.300" end="00:48:49.590" style="s2">knows six months or something because of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.880" end="00:48:52.110" style="s2">its massive rate of infection which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.590" end="00:48:54.570" style="s2">presumably related to the very different</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.110" end="00:48:56.430" style="s2">way that people in New York City live</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.570" end="00:48:58.530" style="s2">just the density of people people</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.430" end="00:49:00.230" style="s2">stacked on top of each other in a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.530" end="00:49:05.610" style="s2">that they aren&#39;t almost anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.230" end="00:49:08.460" style="s2">that and then coupled with no lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.610" end="00:49:09.960" style="s2">in states nearby that might be in a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.460" end="00:49:11.610" style="s2">different circumstance could result in</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.960" end="00:49:13.610" style="s2">people flooding out of New York do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.610" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">close the borders between the states</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.610" end="00:49:18.930" style="s2">what do you do with the fact that human</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:21.900" style="s2">beings by their very nature are</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.930" end="00:49:23.610" style="s2">constantly checking in with how well</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.900" end="00:49:25.020" style="s2">their neighbors seem to be doing in</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.610" end="00:49:27.690" style="s2">order to figure out whether to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.020" end="00:49:30.150" style="s2">or dissatisfied are we gonna create</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.690" end="00:49:31.530" style="s2">massive waves of dissatisfaction in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.150" end="00:49:33.330" style="s2">parts of the country that are unlucky</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.530" end="00:49:35.430" style="s2">enough not to be able to have their</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.330" end="00:49:38.250" style="s2">lockdown lifted this this could turn</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.430" end="00:49:40.530" style="s2">into a disaster if we do not get very</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.250" end="00:49:42.300" style="s2">careful about how we do it and start</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.530" end="00:49:44.120" style="s2">recognizing as you keep pointing out the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.300" end="00:49:47.010" style="s2">difference between individual level</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.120" end="00:49:48.660" style="s2">population level if we start we need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.010" end="00:49:51.180" style="s2">get in touch with the idea of what a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.660" end="00:49:52.740" style="s2">race to the bottom looks like a tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.180" end="00:49:54.510" style="s2">of the Commons and we need to start</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.740" end="00:49:57.330" style="s2">figuring out how we&#39;re going to address</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.510" end="00:49:59.310" style="s2">this so that way you just take a minute</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.330" end="00:50:01.320" style="s2">to define tragedy of the comments before</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.310" end="00:50:05.430" style="s2">we move on a tragedy of the Commons is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.320" end="00:50:08.520" style="s2">situation in which the individual has a</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.430" end="00:50:13.650" style="s2">large effect on their own well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.520" end="00:50:16.350" style="s2">a small effect on the ability on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.650" end="00:50:21.480" style="s2">collective so in other words if your</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.350" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">factory decides not to dump waste into</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.480" end="00:50:27.990" style="s2">an adjacent body of water it will pay a</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:30.810" style="s2">massive cost to dispose of that waste</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.990" end="00:50:32.790" style="s2">properly it will not save an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.810" end="00:50:35.790" style="s2">because so many people are delivering</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.790" end="00:50:38.610" style="s2">their waste to it so and it&#39;s it&#39;s based</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.790" end="00:50:40.049" style="s2">on I mean I&#39;m sure the idea predates</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.610" end="00:50:43.199" style="s2">this but Garret Hardin</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.049" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">a biologist in 1968 wrote in science or</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.199" end="00:50:48.449" style="s2">nature science science American</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:49.559" style="s2">biologist wrote and I think that it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.449" end="00:50:53.069" style="s2">called at the tragedy of the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.559" end="00:50:55.049" style="s2">right and so his sort of allegory almost</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.069" end="00:50:58.069" style="s2">from which he then generated this more</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.049" end="00:51:01.469" style="s2">general case is that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.069" end="00:51:04.380" style="s2">grasslands that is common and people</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.469" end="00:51:08.309" style="s2">living around the edges of it who have</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.380" end="00:51:12.509" style="s2">cattle they want to graze and you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.309" end="00:51:14.579" style="s2">easily over graze grassland and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.509" end="00:51:20.519" style="s2">can see when the grassland is being over</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.579" end="00:51:22.410" style="s2">grazed but those eight or nine cattle</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.519" end="00:51:24.359" style="s2">owners who recognized that the grass is</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.410" end="00:51:25.859" style="s2">being over grazed and who pull back</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.359" end="00:51:29.009" style="s2">their cattle in order to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.859" end="00:51:31.319" style="s2">Commons will suffer relative to the one</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.009" end="00:51:33.329" style="s2">cattle owner who lets his cattle do</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.319" end="00:51:34.949" style="s2">whatever they want the grassland does</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.329" end="00:51:36.839" style="s2">get even more over graze than it would</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.949" end="00:51:39.479" style="s2">but his cattle win and therefore he wins</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.839" end="00:51:41.969" style="s2">relative to everyone else right so this</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.479" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">is a a classic game theoretic hazard</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.969" end="00:51:48.809" style="s2">almost all environmental problems mirror</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:51.209" style="s2">this in one way or another and for us</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.809" end="00:51:54.089" style="s2">for us moderns the solution to this</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.209" end="00:51:56.999" style="s2">involves rational regulation to protect</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.089" end="00:51:59.789" style="s2">the Commons we should point out as long</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.999" end="00:52:01.739" style="s2">as we&#39;re going here a nobel prize was</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.789" end="00:52:04.049" style="s2">earned by elinor ostrom for excellent</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.739" end="00:52:05.489" style="s2">work that demonstrated that many</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.049" end="00:52:08.219" style="s2">cultures have found ways to protect</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.489" end="00:52:10.140" style="s2">against tragedies of the Commons so they</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.219" end="00:52:12.869" style="s2">have basically traditions that play the</p>

<p begin="00:52:15.390" end="00:52:19.499" style="s2">substitutes for regulation but</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.609" end="00:52:21.869" style="s2">nonetheless in the absence of regulation</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.499" end="00:52:24.299" style="s2">or some force that is substituting for</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.869" end="00:52:26.069" style="s2">it you can trigger these hazards and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.299" end="00:52:29.039" style="s2">catastrophe that could unfold could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.069" end="00:52:31.170" style="s2">spectacular in this case so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.039" end="00:52:34.130" style="s2">be really careful now I should also say</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.170" end="00:52:38.189" style="s2">lots of people were connected to our</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.130" end="00:52:41.009" style="s2">asking online for their saying lots of</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.189" end="00:52:42.660" style="s2">people there they&#39;re reading are of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.009" end="00:52:44.130" style="s2">mindset that things never go back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.660" end="00:52:46.170" style="s2">normal they&#39;d like to read some people</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.130" end="00:52:50.640" style="s2">who think it is going to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.170" end="00:52:52.529" style="s2">normal I would ask them to give up on</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.640" end="00:52:53.220" style="s2">the idea that things are going to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.529" end="00:52:54.990" style="s2">back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.220" end="00:52:57.150" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean that they should give</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.990" end="00:53:00.510" style="s2">up on the idea of things being good</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.150" end="00:53:04.680" style="s2">again but the idea that anywhere we need</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.510" end="00:53:09.810" style="s2">to go is back is a terrible error this</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.680" end="00:53:11.790" style="s2">epidemic has been a an amazing lesson</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.810" end="00:53:14.070" style="s2">and as terrible as it is and as</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.790" end="00:53:15.630" style="s2">destructive it as it has been it has</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.070" end="00:53:19.140" style="s2">been a lot better than it might have</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.630" end="00:53:21.150" style="s2">been so in other words this was awful</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.140" end="00:53:23.070" style="s2">but it has also been a gift because it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.150" end="00:53:25.170" style="s2">reveals many many things that we needed</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.070" end="00:53:27.240" style="s2">to know many things did some of us were</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.170" end="00:53:28.710" style="s2">trying to alert the world to and had a</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.240" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">very hard time because it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.710" end="00:53:33.930" style="s2">tangible to people now it&#39;s tangible and</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:36.030" style="s2">the question is what are we to do to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.930" end="00:53:38.430" style="s2">solve this crisis and what are we to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.030" end="00:53:41.160" style="s2">even more importantly to make sure it</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.430" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">never happens again if we go back to</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.160" end="00:53:49.530" style="s2">normal it will happen again it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:53.609" style="s2">that&#39;s right all right one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.530" end="00:53:55.200" style="s2">the dr. Masur says late in the video why</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.609" end="00:53:56.490" style="s2">can&#39;t you go to the park outside and</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.200" end="00:53:58.230" style="s2">walk around but you can&#39;t go to Home</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.490" end="00:54:00.930" style="s2">Depot and nobody&#39;s wearing a mask just</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.230" end="00:54:03.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense so this is me trying</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.930" end="00:54:05.160" style="s2">to find the good parts of the video and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.540" end="00:54:07.500" style="s2">of course this has been our drumbeat</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.160" end="00:54:09.240" style="s2">from the beginning that being outside is</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.500" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">almost certainly one of the best things</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.240" end="00:54:16.440" style="s2">you can do and the number of you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:19.200" style="s2">backwards thinking unknownst regulations</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.440" end="00:54:21.300" style="s2">and their enforcement&#39;s that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:23.430" style="s2">happening all over at least the Western</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.300" end="00:54:26.820" style="s2">world as far as I&#39;ve heard around people</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.430" end="00:54:27.960" style="s2">being locked in their homes effectively</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.820" end="00:54:29.810" style="s2">because they&#39;re told they can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.960" end="00:54:32.670" style="s2">outside they&#39;re not allowed to because</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.810" end="00:54:34.410" style="s2">children in Spain we&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.670" end="00:54:35.970" style="s2">allowed to leave their homes including</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.410" end="00:54:37.470" style="s2">if they live in apartments for six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.970" end="00:54:40.080" style="s2">that just got lifted yesterday or the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.470" end="00:54:41.430" style="s2">day before children under 14 that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.080" end="00:54:43.980" style="s2">appalling</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.430" end="00:54:45.960" style="s2">what what but just an appalling way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.980" end="00:54:49.560" style="s2">have to spend that amount of time if</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.960" end="00:54:51.450" style="s2">you&#39;re a child when actually getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.560" end="00:54:52.680" style="s2">outside in the fresh air as long as</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.450" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not standing right next to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.680" end="00:55:00.089" style="s2">people and yelling and singing is almost</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:55:01.710" style="s2">certainly healthier for you okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.089" end="00:55:03.750" style="s2">was in the middle of watching this video</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.710" end="00:55:06.180" style="s2">yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.750" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">broke for dinner and we had we had our</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.180" end="00:55:10.740" style="s2">delicious dinner and I think you guys</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:13.500" style="s2">were finishing cleaning up and I went to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.740" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">Joe just finished watching it and this</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.500" end="00:55:19.410" style="s2">is what I found</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:20.450" style="s2">Zach you want to pull this up so there</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.410" end="00:55:24.270" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.450" end="00:55:28.740" style="s2">YouTube&#39;s at it again this is choose</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.740" end="00:55:34.680" style="s2">video had at this point four point nine</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.800" end="00:55:36.150" style="s2">million views or so it&#39;s been removed</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.680" end="00:55:39.150" style="s2">for violating YouTube&#39;s Community</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.150" end="00:55:42.990" style="s2">Guidelines now I&#39;ve since found its</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.150" end="00:55:44.910" style="s2">replacement on its bitch shoot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.990" end="00:55:46.829" style="s2">right so you know we&#39;ll post it in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.910" end="00:55:49.980" style="s2">we&#39;ll make a pin to comment at the top</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.829" end="00:55:53.420" style="s2">of the link to this to this video so</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.980" end="00:55:56.010" style="s2">that you guys can find it if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.420" end="00:56:00.180" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that it was actually lost as</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.010" end="00:56:01.710" style="s2">censorship tends not to do but what kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.180" end="00:56:03.690" style="s2">of worlds are we choosing between here</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.710" end="00:56:07.800" style="s2">you can take it down as I couldn&#39;t thank</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.690" end="00:56:11.060" style="s2">you yeah this is an amazing an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.800" end="00:56:13.349" style="s2">turn of events and I will say we expect</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.060" end="00:56:15.960" style="s2">well I wouldn&#39;t say unexpected I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.349" end="00:56:17.579" style="s2">for me living this right now watching</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.960" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">this video watching it get four point</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.579" end="00:56:22.589" style="s2">nine million views in a matter of days</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:24.810" style="s2">sorry to interrupt but I didn&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.589" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">coming yep so I should just point out</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.810" end="00:56:30.960" style="s2">look at where we are neither of us like</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:34.530" style="s2">this video at all we think it contains a</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.960" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2">destructive viewpoint and what&#39;s more it</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.530" end="00:56:40.020" style="s2">is seductive for all of those people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:42.180" style="s2">are looking for someone with authority</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.020" end="00:56:43.260" style="s2">to tell them it&#39;s a fine time for us to</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.180" end="00:56:46.589" style="s2">go back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.260" end="00:56:49.859" style="s2">so the video I think is very negative I</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.589" end="00:56:54.420" style="s2">know you think the same but YouTube&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.859" end="00:56:58.079" style="s2">taking it down is so incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.420" end="00:56:58.980" style="s2">dangerous as a precedent and I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.079" end="00:57:01.140" style="s2">have a number of things to say about</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.980" end="00:57:04.829" style="s2">what I see the dangers and maybe I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.140" end="00:57:07.800" style="s2">just start there we have a situation in</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.829" end="00:57:11.369" style="s2">which YouTube and Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.800" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">are the public square but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.369" end="00:57:16.290" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:18.460" style="s2">they are managed by people a who have</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.290" end="00:57:21.400" style="s2">fiduciary responsibilities to their</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.460" end="00:57:24.310" style="s2">shareholders and B who have a political</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.400" end="00:57:26.440" style="s2">perspective on things now the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.310" end="00:57:28.540" style="s2">what they are trying to do if we take</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.440" end="00:57:29.980" style="s2">them at their word him am i right that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.540" end="00:57:31.960" style="s2">the community guideline they violated</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.980" end="00:57:34.360" style="s2">was they said things that are in</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.960" end="00:57:35.980" style="s2">conflict with what the World Health</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.360" end="00:57:37.600" style="s2">Organization have stated that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.980" end="00:57:38.590" style="s2">apparently on a need-to-know basis you</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.600" end="00:57:42.940" style="s2">need to know and I don&#39;t need to know</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.590" end="00:57:47.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t okay all right but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.940" end="00:57:50.230" style="s2">is that you have probably heard that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.890" end="00:57:51.880" style="s2">cooks are always right and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.230" end="00:57:54.490" style="s2">ironic thing that said amongst</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.880" end="00:57:55.690" style="s2">sophisticated people now when people say</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.490" end="00:57:57.160" style="s2">the cooks are always right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.690" end="00:57:59.440" style="s2">actually mean the cooks are always right</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.160" end="00:58:01.780" style="s2">because most of the cooks are wrong most</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.440" end="00:58:03.070" style="s2">of the time but what there are though</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.780" end="00:58:04.450" style="s2">they were even wrong all the time</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.070" end="00:58:06.130" style="s2">some of them are wrong all the time some</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.450" end="00:58:08.740" style="s2">of those need to specialize in it on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.130" end="00:58:11.980" style="s2">other hand as a bona fide kook let me</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.740" end="00:58:14.830" style="s2">tell you some of the cooks are not wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.980" end="00:58:17.320" style="s2">some of the cooks are trying to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.830" end="00:58:19.150" style="s2">something new that sounds so wrong that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.320" end="00:58:22.320" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult to distinguish from all</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.150" end="00:58:26.590" style="s2">of the other stuff that just is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.320" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">now if you decide that your organization</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.590" end="00:58:31.630" style="s2">YouTube is going to pull all of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.200" end="00:58:33.840" style="s2">stuff that conflicts with some authority</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.630" end="00:58:37.420" style="s2">what you are effectively doing is</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.840" end="00:58:40.570" style="s2">inscribing orthodoxy as the permanent</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.420" end="00:58:42.370" style="s2">state of affairs you are saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.570" end="00:58:44.740" style="s2">the gold standard nobody is ever gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.370" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">beat the who with respect to analysis I</p>

<p begin="01:00:43.660" end="01:00:48.099" style="s2">potentially quite dangerous it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.060" end="01:00:51.910" style="s2">to fuel some fires that already exist</p>

<p begin="01:00:55.060" end="01:00:59.020" style="s2">needs to be of and the correct response</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.980" end="01:01:00.520" style="s2">to it is this one which is all right</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.020" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">let&#39;s look at those claims let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.520" end="01:01:05.020" style="s2">what they&#39;re based on do they stand up</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:07.690" style="s2">they don&#39;t on the other hand let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.020" end="01:01:09.339" style="s2">at the idea that you should be filtering</p>

<p begin="01:01:09.339" end="01:01:12.640" style="s2">the park or the beach or taking a hike</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.740" end="01:01:14.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.640" end="01:01:16.740" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s incredibly destructive and</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.680" end="01:01:19.900" style="s2">we could afford to lift that one</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.740" end="01:01:21.910" style="s2">universally mm-hm so these are things</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.900" end="01:01:25.690" style="s2">that need to be discussed and navigated</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.910" end="01:01:28.150" style="s2">and shutting down viewpoints cannot</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.690" end="01:01:30.250" style="s2">possibly be the right way the censorious</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.150" end="01:01:31.840" style="s2">instinct that these corporations have is</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.250" end="01:01:33.670" style="s2">so lethal</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.840" end="01:01:35.380" style="s2">and especially given some of the crazy</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.670" end="01:01:37.570" style="s2">beliefs that are now circulating inside</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.380" end="01:01:39.400" style="s2">these entities you know there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.570" end="01:01:41.430" style="s2">difference between men and women right</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.400" end="01:01:43.660" style="s2">that&#39;s a dangerous belief you want a</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.430" end="01:01:45.430" style="s2">corporate entity that seems to believe</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.660" end="01:01:47.620" style="s2">that&#39;s true that will kick somebody off</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.430" end="01:01:49.810" style="s2">their platform for saying otherwise you</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.620" end="01:01:52.360" style="s2">want them in charge of deciding what</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.810" end="01:01:55.870" style="s2">kinds of medical positions or medical</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.360" end="01:01:57.790" style="s2">claims we can make no we want the truth</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.870" end="01:02:00.790" style="s2">to come out by virtue of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.790" end="01:02:03.160" style="s2">it is open to critique it is happening</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.790" end="01:02:05.290" style="s2">in the open and having heard a critique</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.160" end="01:02:08.410" style="s2">any person can go back to the original</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.290" end="01:02:10.300" style="s2">source and compare the critique with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.410" end="01:02:12.100" style="s2">original and with their own emerging</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.300" end="01:02:14.350" style="s2">understanding of the situation critiques</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.100" end="01:02:16.750" style="s2">can&#39;t stand on their own and original</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.350" end="01:02:18.940" style="s2">sources need to be able to be critiqued</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.750" end="01:02:21.850" style="s2">you need both sides of those things for</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.940" end="01:02:29.950" style="s2">human knowledge to progress absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.850" end="01:02:33.250" style="s2">yeah where are we time wise can I just</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.950" end="01:02:34.960" style="s2">do a very quick reading you could do a</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.250" end="01:02:36.430" style="s2">quick reading and then I have one final</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:38.740" style="s2">note okay and I wanted to say a couple</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.430" end="01:02:39.820" style="s2">things about India as well so I started</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.740" end="01:02:41.710" style="s2">reading and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.820" end="01:02:46.450" style="s2">getting it very far into it because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:05:47.709" end="01:05:52.119" style="s2">the germ theory of disease right all</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:54.459" style="s2">right well that&#39;s fascinating I have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.119" end="01:05:56.890" style="s2">feeling that that&#39;s going to create a</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.459" end="01:05:59.410" style="s2">great many fans we&#39;re gonna ask you to</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.890" end="01:06:03.190" style="s2">read we&#39;re as fond of hearing Yuri to</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.410" end="01:06:04.750" style="s2">them as I am you experience me reading</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.190" end="01:06:07.270" style="s2">quite a lot of yes I do</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.750" end="01:06:10.210" style="s2">well you&#39;re delightful to listen to it</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.270" end="01:06:11.650" style="s2">alright so the final point that I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.210" end="01:06:17.170" style="s2">to make before we take a break</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.650" end="01:06:19.450" style="s2">prior to our QA is a follow-up on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.170" end="01:06:23.290" style="s2">discussion we had last time about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.450" end="01:06:26.620" style="s2">mystery surrounding the origin of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.290" end="01:06:29.470" style="s2">virus that causes kovat 19 and in</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.620" end="01:06:32.230" style="s2">particular the question of the various</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.470" end="01:06:37.360" style="s2">hypotheses surrounding how this virus</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.230" end="01:06:40.210" style="s2">got loose in will ha the establishment</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.360" end="01:06:42.720" style="s2">has continued from before our live</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.210" end="01:06:48.310" style="s2">stream and has continued after to rally</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.720" end="01:06:50.920" style="s2">around the idea that all responsible</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.310" end="01:06:53.860" style="s2">voices who are informed on this find the</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.920" end="01:06:59.590" style="s2">idea of the virus having escaped from</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.860" end="01:07:02.560" style="s2">the Wuhan Laboratory preposterous sure</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.590" end="01:07:08.290" style="s2">this is actually an NPR story hey Zack</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.560" end="01:07:10.800" style="s2">can you put this up this is an NPR story</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.290" end="01:07:14.620" style="s2">it&#39;s well worth a three minute listen</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.800" end="01:07:16.480" style="s2">and basically this is from April 23rd so</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.620" end="01:07:19.900" style="s2">before our last live stream maybe before</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.480" end="01:07:22.710" style="s2">Yuri Deegan wrote his excellent analysis</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.900" end="01:07:26.200" style="s2">which we spent time on last time and</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.710" end="01:07:27.940" style="s2">their point is that they have looked</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.200" end="01:07:31.510" style="s2">into the question first of all they</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.940" end="01:07:33.430" style="s2">blame Trump for the idea that this virus</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.510" end="01:07:34.810" style="s2">escaped from the lab when of course lots</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.430" end="01:07:37.080" style="s2">of people who are not Trump fans</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.810" end="01:07:43.270" style="s2">including us find this hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.080" end="01:07:45.610" style="s2">credible but their point is this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.270" end="01:07:48.610" style="s2">clearly a false story and their analysis</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.610" end="01:07:49.990" style="s2">comes down basically to two points one</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.610" end="01:07:53.430" style="s2">of which is on compelling and the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.990" end="01:07:58.210" style="s2">one is a lie the first point is these</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.430" end="01:08:00.790" style="s2">laboratories are so very careful that</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.210" end="01:08:01.300" style="s2">the virus could not possibly have</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.790" end="01:08:03.970" style="s2">escaped</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.300" end="01:08:06.100" style="s2">now that&#39;s garbage and you probably know</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.970" end="01:08:08.980" style="s2">enough to know it you know that in</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.100" end="01:08:10.580" style="s2">trying to maintain protection from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.980" end="01:08:11.900" style="s2">possibility of a virus on</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.580" end="01:08:14.240" style="s2">something you&#39;ve touched or this or that</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.900" end="01:08:16.640" style="s2">that it is very hard to juggle all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.240" end="01:08:17.570" style="s2">the things necessary so that in trying</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:20.570" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re wearing something</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.570" end="01:08:22.609" style="s2">protective you need to get that off you</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.570" end="01:08:24.589" style="s2">need to you you&#39;re touching all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.609" end="01:08:27.160" style="s2">things and the successful protocol</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.589" end="01:08:30.859" style="s2">reduces the likelihood of you</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.160" end="01:08:32.870" style="s2">encountering a particle to some number</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.859" end="01:08:34.520" style="s2">that&#39;s very low it can&#39;t reduce it to</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.870" end="01:08:37.040" style="s2">zero because of all of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.520" end="01:08:40.150" style="s2">you can&#39;t control for now the laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.040" end="01:08:44.210" style="s2">may be so good that it maintains</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.150" end="01:08:45.950" style="s2">discipline and only very occasionally</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.210" end="01:08:48.130" style="s2">does any particle escape but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.950" end="01:08:50.810" style="s2">talking about people walking into a cave</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.130" end="01:08:53.390" style="s2">capturing bats that are flying around</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.810" end="01:08:56.420" style="s2">with potentially who knows what in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.390" end="01:08:58.550" style="s2">air taking samples swabbing them you</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.420" end="01:09:01.220" style="s2">know fecal swabs or whatever getting</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.550" end="01:09:03.290" style="s2">them into a vial etc etc you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.220" end="01:09:05.839" style="s2">reduce the chances of some particle</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.290" end="01:09:09.950" style="s2">making it on to some thing that escapes</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.839" end="01:09:11.870" style="s2">notice to zero okay so you can reduce it</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.950" end="01:09:13.250" style="s2">low but you can&#39;t reduce it to zero and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.870" end="01:09:14.240" style="s2">then there&#39;s the part of the analysis</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.250" end="01:09:19.390" style="s2">that&#39;s just dead wrong</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.240" end="01:09:22.850" style="s2">they say by the way these viruses are</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.390" end="01:09:26.839" style="s2">immediately frozen a live version of</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.850" end="01:09:29.570" style="s2">them is maintained but rarely accessed</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.839" end="01:09:32.030" style="s2">and when it is accessed it is often no</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.570" end="01:09:34.460" style="s2">longer viable that part may be true but</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.030" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">then they say that these labs are just</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.460" end="01:09:38.390" style="s2">studying the genomes right that these</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:40.040" style="s2">aren&#39;t viral particles they&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.390" end="01:09:42.859" style="s2">they just sequence the genomes to look</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.040" end="01:09:44.930" style="s2">at them and this isn&#39;t true the analysis</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.859" end="01:09:47.920" style="s2">that we talked about last time talks</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.930" end="01:09:50.270" style="s2">extensively about this gain-of-function</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.920" end="01:09:52.100" style="s2">manipulations these chimeras that are</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.270" end="01:09:53.960" style="s2">designed actually to produce highly</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.100" end="01:09:55.970" style="s2">infectious viruses the Chimera being</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.960" end="01:09:57.950" style="s2">effectively a hybrid created in a lab</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.970" end="01:10:00.860" style="s2">yeah combination two things fused</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.950" end="01:10:03.380" style="s2">together so these labs produce these</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.860" end="01:10:05.120" style="s2">chimeras specifically because they think</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.380" end="01:10:07.220" style="s2">they may be highly infectious and</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.120" end="01:10:08.930" style="s2">ostensibly for the purpose of figuring</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.220" end="01:10:10.580" style="s2">out what to do if one of them escapes</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.930" end="01:10:13.820" style="s2">into the world so they are creating</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.580" end="01:10:16.580" style="s2">viable viruses and they are testing them</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.820" end="01:10:19.730" style="s2">on various things including live cells</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.580" end="01:10:21.770" style="s2">so the idea that we can all just relax</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.730" end="01:10:23.119" style="s2">about this hypothesis because scientists</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.770" end="01:10:26.239" style="s2">have looked at it and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.119" end="01:10:28.789" style="s2">is nonsense trust them what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.239" end="01:10:31.340" style="s2">nonsense is that there is a spectacular</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.789" end="01:10:33.860" style="s2">coincidence about this virus having</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.340" end="01:10:37.939" style="s2">emerged in Wuhan and the laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.860" end="01:10:39.469" style="s2">being there that is very hard to dismiss</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.939" end="01:10:41.689" style="s2">so could it have come through a wet</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.469" end="01:10:44.389" style="s2">market maybe although the evidence for</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.689" end="01:10:45.919" style="s2">that is pretty weak is there some other</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.389" end="01:10:47.479" style="s2">reason it might have emerged in Wuhan</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.919" end="01:10:49.429" style="s2">there could be natural explanation</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.479" end="01:10:50.840" style="s2">somebody could be framing the Wuhan lab</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.429" end="01:10:52.399" style="s2">there are all kinds of ways that this</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.840" end="01:10:53.780" style="s2">could have unfolded but the idea that we</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.399" end="01:10:55.610" style="s2">can all just simply put that one to rest</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.780" end="01:10:56.929" style="s2">because scientists have looked at it and</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.610" end="01:11:01.099" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to look any further is</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.929" end="01:11:02.570" style="s2">just garbage all right so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.099" end="01:11:05.449" style="s2">connect that up with the last thing we</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.570" end="01:11:06.979" style="s2">were saying the establishment wants you</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.449" end="01:11:08.389" style="s2">to think you don&#39;t need to worry about</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.979" end="01:11:10.699" style="s2">whether this might have escaped from</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.389" end="01:11:12.289" style="s2">Wuhan of course we need to mean escape</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.699" end="01:11:13.429" style="s2">from the lab in Wuhan of course we need</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.289" end="01:11:15.919" style="s2">to worry about it because it has</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.429" end="01:11:18.079" style="s2">implications for what we do right if</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.919" end="01:11:19.639" style="s2">this was a chimera that escaped a lab</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.079" end="01:11:21.919" style="s2">that was studying it for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.639" end="01:11:25.909" style="s2">protecting humanity then it isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.919" end="01:11:28.550" style="s2">bio weapon we need to know that frankly</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.909" end="01:11:30.829" style="s2">if this lab screwed up and this thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.550" end="01:11:33.050" style="s2">got out I&#39;ll be angry that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.829" end="01:11:34.610" style="s2">regulations and these are frankly world</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.050" end="01:11:36.590" style="s2">regulations these are regulations that</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.610" end="01:11:39.320" style="s2">the the world&#39;s scientific community</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.590" end="01:11:41.119" style="s2">imposes on such labs I will be angry</p>

<p begin="01:11:51.800" end="01:11:55.519" style="s2">has a huge cost to humanity and will</p>

<p begin="01:12:01.519" end="01:12:06.110" style="s2">because we need to understand what it</p>

<p begin="01:12:10.280" end="01:12:13.729" style="s2">emerged in Wuhan then we need to know</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.809" end="01:12:16.369" style="s2">that that this requires us to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.729" end="01:12:18.649" style="s2">discuss it and if YouTube can decide</p>

<p begin="01:12:18.649" end="01:12:23.449" style="s2">lifting the lockdown until the who says</p>

<p begin="01:12:23.449" end="01:12:27.320" style="s2">they could also decide that it is not</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.369" end="01:12:29.570" style="s2">okay for us to discuss the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.320" end="01:12:32.869" style="s2">that this virus was a laboratory made</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.570" end="01:12:34.789" style="s2">since that at chimera and we could be</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.869" end="01:12:36.789" style="s2">eliminated from YouTube and I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.789" end="01:12:38.379" style="s2">you this hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.789" end="01:12:40.329" style="s2">exist for a reason because it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:12:42.429" end="01:12:46.569" style="s2">we can learn that but we have to be able</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.379" end="01:12:53.559" style="s2">to discuss it in the open in order to do</p>
