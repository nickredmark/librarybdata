<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">and um in terms of definitions haven&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">sort of its purpose let me</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">try and clarify that so and carrie</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">corrected me if i&#39;m wrong but so in</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">content management systems you generally</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">have content types</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">so in our case i imagine kerry did you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">already build one for a project</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">well i&#39;m in the process of just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:14.720" style="s2">going through all the different types of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">fields and what you can have for now you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.720" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">can relate it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">how you can gather content different</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">bits of content together</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">for for an example if you had a content</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:25.839" style="s2">type for project you&#39;d have project name</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">who the owner is and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">yeah and then then you have a content</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">type of blog art girl content type of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">page con</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s any type of group of fields of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">that yeah that okay as a group yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">like as i said i&#39;m shit at explaining</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">things like so</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not an easy concept and especially</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t like labels and anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">yeah and content types are really bad</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">phrase because everyone thinks oh well</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">yeah video image and it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">not what they were like in the category</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">so is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">kind of like different tables then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:03.519" style="s2">it is okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m just thinking it exactly is</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.519" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">stored as one&#39;s a table in most</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">right so so basically like</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">us in terms of your projects and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">um is there any specific content types</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">that you might like to have um that i</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought about</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">yet i think that&#39;s mostly what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">trying to ask</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">in a in a kind of case</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">well yeah yeah i&#39;m just doing um</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">something i&#39;m just going through a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">couple of tutorials on</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">how to to put all the terms together and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">the taxonomy terms and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:41.279" style="s2">you know um because you can have tags</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">and you can have taxonomies and as i</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.279" end="00:10:45.440" style="s2">said you can basically field everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">you know we stick everything into its</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.440" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">own field</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">with whatever type of thing that you you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">might like</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">you know i mean so and because um</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">i&#39;m just i suppose with with projects</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:01.200" style="s2">and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">um what would be kind of relevant to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.200" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">and yours</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">basically because if i can kind of get a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">grasp on that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">then make something that that&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:12.480" style="s2">like some events</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">a project itself by the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">i i think so right okay so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">i thought we would have envisioned it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:32.720" style="s2">yeah okay then well that that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">a start</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">so in terms in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">like i said i&#39;ve already got that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">help wanted and the help needed</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">and who&#39;s involved um all the links to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">and and stuff like that but is there</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">anything else that</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">i can&#39;t think of anything else right</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">yeah i mean once we see the basics some</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">some ideas might pop up</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">yeah exactly i think as we actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">start to try to like add</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:04.480" style="s2">some content things will probably pop up</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">but it sounds like you&#39;ve sort of got</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">the basics cover to start with which we</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">can probably make do with yeah so as i</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll get the basics up in that and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">come in and tell me</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">um what you like what you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:19.120" style="s2">what you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">um and then after that we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">the back end</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">of stuff as well um but like as i said</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">i&#39;m just trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">the stuff that you can actually just see</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">without having to join</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">and stuff like that and and because of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">the way drupal&#39;s organized you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">actually do</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">inline editing so you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">you know you can just do it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">have to go and find the menu you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">actually do it from the actual piece of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">content that you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">as well so so yeah so i suppose that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">i was trying to get me address all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">that and thinking what people wanted</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">um but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">okay yeah i think as billy said sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">the sooner that we can see</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">even just like the you know even if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">feel that it&#39;s only 60</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">done as long as we can sort of see a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">project and see stuff that project is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">i think that will help start putting</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:11.680" style="s2">some context around like</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.360" style="s2">okay i can see how it&#39;s being structured</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.680" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">and okay i want these extra</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.360" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">uh content types there and so on</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">like one of the things i&#39;m not sure if</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:40.399" style="s2">clear as mud</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">so i think your concern about</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">data privacy is usually there is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:46.160" style="s2">of a public and a private side of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">user data</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.160" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">so as long as you make it you just have</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">to make sure you make it clear which</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">pieces are public</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">or private although yeah i think most</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">people filling stuff in here they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">expect everything to be public</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">except for their email address hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">true yeah i guess i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">also wondering like if we start to get</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">workers and like people that want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">chip in on projects but</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">maybe not be like the public face of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">they might not want their profile shown</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">at all whereas</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">i guess i&#39;m kind of talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">almost public</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">personalities as a part of the projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">right like so</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">so jubilee i&#39;ll take a look at the video</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">and see if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:20.880" style="s2">easy fit to get a spreadsheet out</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">because i&#39;m pretty good with that oh i</p>

<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">humanity like structure</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">where ten thousand people per union ten</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">dollars a month and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">that would in my mouth equal about three</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">tiny homes per month</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">if they&#39;re around you know three thirty</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">thousand to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">and then once you&#39;re living in one</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">you&#39;re paying rent back to the pool</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">so every to every like there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">different changing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s how much does it cost to make one</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">tiny house it could be twenty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">could be fifty thousand i have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">how much rent you&#39;re getting and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">how much membership fee is because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">grows exponentially right we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">with three per month but as rent</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">increases</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">holding membership the same how how soon</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">can we get those 10 000 people in houses</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.760" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">by my calculation it was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">300 years i was like okay that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">quite so sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">um yeah so just wanting to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.520" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">play with those three numbers</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">and i was doing it very like okay this</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:20.799" style="s2">month and then we add it</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:20.799" style="s2">and it goes like it&#39;s yeah my excel</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">capability isn&#39;t enough to notice my</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">math it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">i know my math was better but</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">yeah that makes sense trying to figure i</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">if i&#39;m trying to decide if i have enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">information to try and do a simulation</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">i think i do i&#39;ll i&#39;ll hit you up on</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">message or if i</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">can&#39;t if i&#39;m missing something awesome</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">i&#39;m also good i&#39;m gonna ask my mom</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">because she</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">know if she can actually do this</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">but i&#39;m gonna ask so you know</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:57.120" style="s2">appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got a version that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.120" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">already started it might help to send</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">that to bentley and to mom as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">just because i i find that seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">somebody started on even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">terrible</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">seeing what seeing what you&#39;ve labeled</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">things and seeing what you&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">at least for me sometimes it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.600" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">have to be like oh okay i see what</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to do here</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know yeah because i was like</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">doing it by month of life and then we</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">over the next month then i was also like</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">trying to have this time lag of three</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">months how</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">long it would take to make one so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">not paying rent until at that point but</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">honestly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">yeah maybe you are paying rent for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">three months for building it because</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like a down payment i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">building normal standards houses</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">tiny houses tiny oh okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">no you wouldn&#39;t be able to build a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">standard house for 30 000 but being able</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">like how much material is in there the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">idea is also it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">like a barn raising like habitat for</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">humanity you&#39;re putting in sweat</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">equities there&#39;s no labor involved</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">or very little labor involved you might</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">have to get the experts but we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">putting in</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">time so it&#39;s only the resources and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">can bulk by them and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">that&#39;s also as you continue on if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">building three you can&#39;t both buy</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">when you&#39;re building 15 20 per month you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">more we&#39;ll buy it i also wonder at what</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">point we could start</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">looking at the 3d printed houses i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">sure if those are</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">all scalable yet or what but that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">around for a while now and those seem</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:22.159" style="s2">pretty cool yeah part of the tiny house</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">model in my head anyway is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">movable</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">so it means that as you&#39;re figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">how to build a community you can move</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">them around to see what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">configuration is if i don&#39;t like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:31.280" style="s2">community i can move it to somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">else that you that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.280" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">part of shelter is land resources and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">labor</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">and so land can can change sorry to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">build a house right like to get a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">physical structure you need a land to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">put it on you need the labor</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">and you need the resources we&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">in the labor we&#39;re hopefully both buying</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">the resources then we don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">the land like maybe i own lands and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:53.039" style="s2">putting a tiny house on there</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:55.039" style="s2">or we&#39;re figuring out an infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.039" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">to deal with farmers and there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.039" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">be five</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">here like that the tiny houses can move</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.840" end="00:24:02.799" style="s2">they&#39;re not because the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:03.760" style="s2">then yeah cobb houses are actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.799" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">cheaper to build but then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.760" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">physically</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">there and you legally can&#39;t do that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">some places</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">and so like working with the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">you can own a tiny house and move it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">about and or</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">we if if like i&#39;m just gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">together tech owns the tiny houses</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">then we can then if one person isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">using it we can decide where they move</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">right but there&#39;s there&#39;s more focus</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">yeah so at least the first wave will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">mobile tiny homes and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">after there you can say because you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:38.000" style="s2">might end up with almost like a fleet of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">mobile ones that can move around and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">that may even end up being your crew</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">that&#39;s building the other homes</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.600" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">and then they sort of move around and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">leave permanent</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">homes as they go yeah if they</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">if they can&#39;t right there&#39;d be multiple</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">kinds but yeah that was kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">how to build their own houses and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">we had a fractal of uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">there was at least one culture in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">history of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.279" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">were pretty good at moving houses around</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">and they lived in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">like the uh cards</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:16.799" style="s2">the big cards and they were bans</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">the caravans for the dancing singing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.799" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">labor</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">yes yeah i think the natives were quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">good at</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">doing like sort of mobile homes where</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">they would have certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">i guess types of settlements that could</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">easily be moved you know because you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">go to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.000" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">an area of the prairies head up to your</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">thing either the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.480" style="s2">the weather changes or the herds move</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">you pick up you move</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.480" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">yeah the central native americans</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">yeah oh yeah i guess you should probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">say native americans because native</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">yeah and then uh the mongols back in</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">in ancient times generally</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">yeah uh so and you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">rent so does that mean it goes in</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">perpetuity it&#39;s not you end up owning</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">the house</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not a mortgage yeah the idea is if</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">we&#39;re getting together as 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">and wanting to house 10 000 people that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">you unders like</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">you&#39;re paying what i was saying is i</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">started 500 it wasn&#39;t enough 750</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">a month but the idea is if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">releasing people from game</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">a to concentrate on game b that 750</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily paid by the person it</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">might be paid by the community</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">right like we needed we need an income</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">that pays for 10 people because we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">10 people that need to live here</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">you know like like it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">necessarily that i&#39;m paying that rent</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">but the rent needs to be paid for that</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">structure so that there&#39;s more houses</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">being built later</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s like membership fees and that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">how it exponentially goes otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">we&#39;re only going to have three per month</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">right whatever the beginning is it kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">of just stays that every time</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">yeah and i think if that&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">like under the umbrella of an</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">organization that will end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">other things that that can sort of end</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">i think it totally makes sense for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">organization to still own it because</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">you know the group the co-op whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">you want to call it that built it</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">and if you charge rent and the person</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">never owns it but the rent is reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">then that&#39;s already a win over the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">current system</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s sort of meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">people that maybe normal landlords</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:15.679" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">to rent to or that just wouldn&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.679" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">the person couldn&#39;t afford it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">i think that still ends up being omni</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">one maybe not quite to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:24.399" style="s2">the person would want</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">but it you know could help them get on</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.399" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">their feet and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.000" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">you could give them options though that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">um if they wanted to sort of like buy</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">the house</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">wanted to stay you know what i mean and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">wanted to sort of like own somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">you know i mean so you could give them</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">the option to do that as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">you know if you paid this for rent</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">you&#39;re just renting if you paid this</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">for rent that extra amount goes towards</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">buying it and after a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">time you&#39;ll own it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">i i guess i&#39;m still a bit confused</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">because jubilee is saying the person in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:57.760" style="s2">the house may not be the person paying</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">the rent</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.760" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">right yeah that part confused me like my</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">understanding from what you</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:05.840" style="s2">said is that you would get yours your</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">subscribers to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">you know this housing system they would</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">be paying into a system that would</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">constantly just be focusing on building</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">new homes</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">and then you also have people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">paying rent paying to that same system</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">you know so</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">the first year maybe you&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">three months and then the next year</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">people paying rent you might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">afford to build four a month</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.919" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">and then the the following year five six</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">and then you know eight and then ten</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">and and so on i would assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">rent just goes into there and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">having other people pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">you might just have like separate</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">projects where like hey if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">also wanting to chime in and help people</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">parent in this village in california</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a separate one for that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:46.240" style="s2">people pay into</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">is that i just meant like the rent is</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:48.640" style="s2">paid for the shelter right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">saying that if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.640" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">if you have this shelter there&#39;s 750</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:54.799" style="s2">per month it could be me who pays it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">writing come out of my disability amount</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.799" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">and come out of my</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:28:59.360" style="s2">my um you know contract work and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">combined with or</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.360" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">it could be hey these 10 people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">living together they&#39;re focused on</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">creating this technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">so the technology companies paying their</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">rent right that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">it&#39;s part of having an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">community is having an income that pays</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">whatever it is we set up right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">not because how do you make money if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:19.279" style="s2">don&#39;t have a job right if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">an income so it&#39;s like right part of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.279" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">is coming and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">trading in a way that that is omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">right that is like oh we&#39;re releasing</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">from game a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">so that we can focus on releasing other</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">people from game a</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">um maybe i can pay rent maybe i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">right it&#39;s on like a per</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:35.919" style="s2">person basis in which case it is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">together tech that owns it and if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.919" end="00:29:39.840" style="s2">want to own it outright</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">then they&#39;re you know maybe one in ten</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.840" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">is is sold that way</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">sold for profit so that more of it can</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">go back into the system but the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">we&#39;re just figuring out how can we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">how do i get a roof over my head that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">yes i want it to be permanent right i</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be kicked out because i</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">can&#39;t pay the rent but we got to figure</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">that out because</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">we need more money coming into the pool</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">so that it can go to the next person and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">the next person the next person</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">yeah i think membership fees are not</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">paying the rent that was the part i</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">wanted</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">no membership fees are the um ten</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">dollars per month to actually be part</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">of because because with ten dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">month times the ten thousand then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2">can make</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">my rough calculations three per month so</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">that is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">so once you start paying rent you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:20.399" style="s2">longer paying that ten dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not paying your rent right</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.399" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">but in the beginning it&#39;s like right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">idea is is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">helping house people right that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">including you possibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">but maybe not right that was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:32.559" style="s2">conversation that we have it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">maybe it is more like habitat for</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.559" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">where the 10 000 are focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">housing a thousand of us not ten</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">thousand of us but yeah that the rent</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come from the membership fee the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:45.279" style="s2">membership fee is just a way to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">money pooled so that we can buy</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.279" end="00:30:48.399" style="s2">and create so buy resources to create</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">tiny houses with</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">that also it exponentially grows because</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">the membership and the rent that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">that makes sense yeah i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:00.799" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t need to be 10 a month</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.799" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">that was the other thing is i was like</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s 25</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">a month maybe it&#39;s because the more it</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">is the more houses we can build of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.720" style="s2">but it also depends on what people want</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">to put in right like i&#39;d be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.720" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">put in 10</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">a month even if i never got a house i</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know if i&#39;d be willing to put in</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:15.919" style="s2">25</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">a month probably but that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.919" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">about my cut off</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">yeah and then the the interesting part</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">is is there any sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.840" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">i think like subscription tier almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">where it&#39;s like is there a reason for</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">the person to pay more or is it just</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">to pay more well the idea wouldn&#39;t be it</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">would be like we would set it at 10 or</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">we would set it to 25 right i see so</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">a single in yeah on the spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">anyway right not hey we have this many</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">people at 10 and there&#39;s many people at</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">25.</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">that&#39;s also part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">and in case of like bigger settlements</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">it would make also sense to um</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.760" end="00:32:04.720" style="s2">connect the rent and paying for staff</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">uh to uh perhaps services that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">owning or renting the house uh we need</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">an awards for it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">uh could provide to the community if</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">like for example there is a community</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">having an open slot for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:22.559" style="s2">dentist and if someone happens to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">uh want to leave game a and everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.559" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">and just move to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">smaller place where uh for just</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">providing the service that the person</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">already does provide</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">in exchange for money uh here would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:37.039" style="s2">in exchange for</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">uh like accommodation and everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">that the community provides</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s an idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">yeah the idea at least like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.159" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">brand new i was two days ago i was like</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">oh my god these four solution racing</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">solved everything like i&#39;m like if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">can figure out education because i need</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">my kids to be educated</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">and with copenhagen it&#39;s like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">safe how do we educate children</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">food and shelter and community so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:04.399" style="s2">can move around and have</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">and if we focus on the autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.399" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">individual right that it isn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">everyone has to be omni-win every second</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">of every day it&#39;s like hey do you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">shelter do you have food how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">a community how do we work through it</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">then there&#39;s no one in power over you</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">once you figure out shelter</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">food and community and then you freed</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">yourself from game and you can start</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">concentrating more on game b</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">and so in my ideal world the people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">first get shelter the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">most powerful in game b</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">right the people who are most able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">contribute to game b</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:37.519" style="s2">um without because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">sheltered and then they can they that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.519" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">a whole other exponential growth right</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">that has nothing to do with currency oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">well i&#39;m sure it&#39;s something to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">currency</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">but it&#39;s if if</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">like the five of us were sheltered right</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">like we&#39;re creating together tech we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">figuring we&#39;re figuring that out</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be able to concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">creating those omni-win solutions the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">scheduling app and those kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:34:00.159" style="s2">and whoever those people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily sheltering the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.159" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">people who are the most in need of it</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">it&#39;s need slash um</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">contribution to the community because</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be more impact from</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">i think because you&#39;re starting out</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">focusing on the mobile tiny homes</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:21.679" style="s2">you could sort of like the part that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about with people</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">getting homes and training services for</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">it i wonder if your first group are the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">people that are building the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">the mobile tiny homes if they set up</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">some sort of like even a possibly</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">permanent community let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">somewhere in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">they get the free housing and then a</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">part of that is they churn out these</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">mobile tiny homes which hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">lowers the cost of it um and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">can ship them out from there and say</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">like oh okay we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">we&#39;ll we&#39;ll figure that from the from</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:51.119" style="s2">this point we can ship out the mobile</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">tiny homes you know in a 100 mile radius</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.119" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">and then you can plant those spots and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">have your sort of mobile communities and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">and they can move around and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:00.839" style="s2">know later on you set up another</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">permanent one maybe on the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.839" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">coast</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:08.320" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s the fort one</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">of the the four solution reasons is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.320" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">meta community is the hundred groups of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">100 figuring out those</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">solutions for meta community of like hey</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">how do we do plumbing and how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">this how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">do that and a bigger infrastructure of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">where do you want your tiny house to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">right like which community do you want</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">to live in are they okay with you being</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">there and what is that work you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">that is contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">to game b around it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">yeah yeah that was part of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">raising was hey why don&#39;t we house the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">people building it first</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">and they can tr they could even travel</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">around right like they could be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">community that travels around and builds</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">because they&#39;re a fam like out of family</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">a grouping of 10 families</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">that although they&#39;re maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">nomadic right they&#39;re like yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">our ideal we get us to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">a connection in community but we get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.680" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">travel around or they have a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">structure and they ship them out</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:57.119" style="s2">or i mean any number of things right</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like what works for</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:00.880" style="s2">them as an individual and what works for</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">the for the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.880" end="00:36:05.760" style="s2">bigger people to get more houses that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">end up being very cool</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">like having this this nomadic tribe of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">settlement builders but like in</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">in the modern day yeah and tech i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">tech</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like the builders and the tech</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">people right that are like hey</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">building i mean i want that i want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">the other options like buy a hotel and</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:27.280" style="s2">just start a tech company</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">which is also a an option but</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">figuring out together how do we house</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">ourselves how do we keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">growing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">kind of being a snail that you i just</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">like tiny house that i can just take</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">with me everywhere i go</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">and then i will be able to uh pick the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">best location that</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">feels just right at the moment be it at</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">the sea or in the mountains or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">that would make sense and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">settlement would not be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">set of houses and renting and everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">it would be more like the space for</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:05.200" style="s2">camping</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">where you can just get your house into</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.200" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">spot into the place and then it could</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:11.520" style="s2">connect to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">like uh power water and everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.520" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:17.440" style="s2">and then you could leave there for as</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">long as you want or</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">as long as the community lets you stay</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">in case you are not the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">best number of communities but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">that would make sense i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:31.040" style="s2">sorry constituent</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a there is something to like being</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">and i could tell it to just slowly move</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">that&#39;d be nice and that is like</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to be nomadic i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">in one location</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">and develop roots and do that but i</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">would love for other people to be able</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">to come through that community and i</p>

<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">that we were traveling together so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">have we still have that connection those</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">roots</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">and you still need to grow food and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">still need to do those things which</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">require</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">more of a like a subtle location but yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.960" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">if you want to you can travel around and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">see this bigger connection</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">and as long as the community is willing</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">and you&#39;re needed that can go and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:18.880" style="s2">there can also be ones that are more</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">permanent</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.320" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">did you see the mortal engines i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">the title was</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">and it was about it&#39;s kind of science</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">fiction</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">about the future in which cities are</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">movable and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">like you have the biggest round was</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">london at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">i think so it was a whole city on very</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">very huge giant um</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">what&#39;s the the trucks i think of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.640" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">something you have on the tank and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:55.599" style="s2">that&#39;s it was able to move like whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.599" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">and i just imagine because there can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">tiny houses in forms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">just trailers that people use especially</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">in us</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:10.400" style="s2">i guess and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">then i also remember seeing uh some</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.400" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">projects about</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">uh not so tiny uh places like</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">you would have everything could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">packed on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">uh on a trailer but then it could expand</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">when you arrive</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">at the place you want to be and then uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">you have like</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">not very small house it was like normal</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.920" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">size almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">so there&#39;s something something to that</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">instead of dystopian like the burning</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">and all the vehicles there just</p>

<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">very uh very big advantage over</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">what we have now and what we have now is</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">houses that are just functional but</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">they are not um or not always at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.839" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">piece of art</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">you know what uh when i think about</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:38.480" style="s2">solar pump what comes to mind is uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">like places of the villages that in</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.480" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">um every house house is slightly</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">and every house and every building is uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">not only just uh a place performing</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">a function but also uh something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:57.839" style="s2">was created to be both functional and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.839" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">yeah and state of art something</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">like it would provide a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">uh very good environment much better</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">uh like having rows of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">same size same look houses that we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">now in so many places</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">okay here you do but you&#39;re not muted</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.800" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">like sort of trying to figure out how it</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">fits into together tech in this whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">which is like i&#39;ve got a fair number of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">game a ideas</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">profitable enterprise ideas which could</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">very easily fit into a game b</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">enterprise and possibly help fund tech</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:08.079" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">tech projects and housing and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.079" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">that so i guess i&#39;m wondering how</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">aid those two fit together just at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">most basic level</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">um and then how to start</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">this sort of profitable company piece</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:25.280" style="s2">but under like a co-op</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">umbrella where you know eventually you</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.280" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">would end up where the people working on</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">it would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">getting a salary but then all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">profits of that company</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">would just be going into this game b</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.839" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">ecosystem to help you know pay for</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">reasons go around wikileaks</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:38.319" style="s2">and housing and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">reasons i know we have we share this</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.319" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">vision somewhat of like instead of</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">having an intentional community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">that&#39;s source of income is food based</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">right hey we&#39;re gonna make our own jams</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna make our own honey</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:52.560" style="s2">which is we&#39;re feeding ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:53.920" style="s2">feeding maybe we have that connection</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.560" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">maybe that is how some of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.920" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">make an income but technology is</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">powerful like profitable and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">use it to create kb</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">why not so yeah if we can create ones</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">that it&#39;s fully transparent where the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">money is and where it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">where it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:10.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s also yes paying people a living</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">wage and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:13.119" style="s2">creating something that is profitable</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">and there&#39;s a ton of technology that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.119" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">ideas that could be profitable</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">yeah what i have in mind is it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">omni-wind blackstone where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">this giant company that owns tech that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">owns</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">you know farms that owns real estate</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">owns all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">where the tech is meant to make money</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">and the real estate is meant to grow and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:32.319" style="s2">also make money</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s not paying out shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.319" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s going back into the company to help</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">you know buy more tech companies and</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:37.359" style="s2">help start more tech companies and do</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.359" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">more real estate so it can grow even</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">more i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:45.359" style="s2">fingers and lots of pies adriel fingers</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">in lots of pies</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.359" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">different types of pies as well you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">what i mean yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">diversified it&#39;s a good idea in gaming</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a good idea in game b</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">so um and then i guess on that note i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">wondering if either bentley or matush</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">either a no salesforce or b wants to</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">learn it</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">because i&#39;ve got a couple of projects</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:09.280" style="s2">that i&#39;d like to do soon</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">and uh i know you know the</p>

<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">a developer if push comes to shove i</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">might learn it for this because that i</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:19.280" style="s2">think is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:20.079" style="s2">you know narrow way to learn it but i</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.280" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">think it would also</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.079" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">be cool to start a project with like me</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">a developer and</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">mind a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">easier bridge to gap with like you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:01.520" style="s2">companies that you can directly market</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">to</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve uh i&#39;ve one of the options for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">making money is to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">some um small to medium-sized</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">plug-ins and different um that&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">a good way to start rather than building</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">a product completely from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">you&#39;re building on someone else&#39;s thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:30.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s usually a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">a temporary thing or you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.240" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">rely on it fully but it&#39;s a great place</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">to start</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">um so yeah so it so maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">schedule some time and see if um</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">see if i agree on the market because it</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">would take an investment of time right</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">right yeah yeah and that&#39;s i guess a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">part of the long-term conversation for</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">this it&#39;s a project like this</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">what does that look like for the people</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">who start it versus you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">after it&#39;s actually a company operating</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">paying people a salary</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">that one&#39;s obvious it would operate</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">fairly like game a just you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">as omni when is possible but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">founders and sort of the initial startup</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">crew there would be special</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:08.319" style="s2">accommodations because you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:11.280" style="s2">pay them until</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.319" end="00:48:12.400" style="s2">it&#39;s launched yeah yeah and and if</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.280" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.400" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">founding a company like that then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">know that you&#39;re not going to become</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">bill gates or elon musk because right</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:22.240" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">exactly the the founders like it end up</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.240" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">being you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">probably in the company overall i would</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">think which i think is how mondragon</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">works i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">where there&#39;s like a capped multiplier</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">where like the highest paid person can</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">only make you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">x times what the lowest paid person is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">and you don&#39;t get equity in the company</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">either right</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">exactly all the equity goes back into</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:44.720" style="s2">the company to help it grow so like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">you are going to end up as jeff bezos or</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.720" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">elon musk like you won&#39;t become a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:50.240" style="s2">billionaire</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">but you could end up you know being like</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.240" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">you know on the board of a billion</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">dollar company</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">you just wouldn&#39;t have direct access to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">that money in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">a game a player would which yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">turns out they don&#39;t have that much of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">direct access exactly it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s all on paper but liquid for them</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:10.240" style="s2">but at some point a lot of it is yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">yeah that would</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.240" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">um that&#39;d be interesting i hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">combined my game a designs with my game</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:20.319" style="s2">b aspirations yet to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">impact of building something really cool</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.319" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">watching it make a billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">and then making the same salary i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">making now</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">i do think haven&#39;t quite at least for</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:30.800" style="s2">the start there does need to be some</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:33.200" style="s2">sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.800" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">not even comparable in numbers wise at</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">all but some sort of like a hey</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:38.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re a part of that founding crew</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">where if you were to because i could</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.720" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">keep this idea and just game a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">incorporate as a for-profit company and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">potentially make</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">a bunch of money right or i could join</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">up with you and we could do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">gaming company</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">so yeah there is that part of what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">draw to bring this to</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">the yeah an incentive for the investment</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">and the risk-taking but not an unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">upside which yeah it&#39;s silly people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">saying like well if you don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:03.359" style="s2">unlimited upside</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:05.280" style="s2">who would start these businesses and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">like do you really think if bill gates</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.280" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">got a couple billion less than he has</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">now today he wouldn&#39;t have started</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">marketing if he got one</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t think that&#39;s good i&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">got how is he worth</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">80 billion it&#39;s likely he only has 5</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:23.040" style="s2">billion now</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">oh well then just throw it all out yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.040" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">i would i would never started the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">company</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:28.640" style="s2">if i knew that limit was there i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">think so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.640" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the like to say that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a risk to start a company</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">there of course is and so if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">taking on the risk there should be some</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">kind of incentive i mean we&#39;re taking on</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">a risk</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">but we&#39;re also choosing like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">right i choose to spend this hour taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:46.319" style="s2">on like</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">yeah on my deathbed why did i waste that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.319" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">hour it&#39;s not no that&#39;s not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:52.079" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna be happy that i was here but</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">there&#39;s like if we&#39;re putting in tens of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.079" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">thousands of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">yeah you know what i&#39;m gonna need a</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">financial compensation that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">equivalent later on and</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">to be in that tension but know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">you&#39;re never gonna make a billion</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">dollars because tech is risky</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:07.839" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s powerful and if we do it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">together it&#39;s less risky and more</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.839" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">powerful but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:12.559" style="s2">ton of potential for profit and if we</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.559" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">be in that and be like where is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">profit going so that it can create more</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">i&#39;d upside all the way in my mind so</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">markush is that something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">interested in as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll definitely take a look at it</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:31.280" style="s2">and uh yes it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">sounds good and besides what i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.280" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">add to this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">uh we as humans all we have is as i</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">recently</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">heard someone said uh what we have is</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:42.160" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">energy and agency this is all we got and</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.160" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">there is nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:47.119" style="s2">the money and profits and power and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.119" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">these are illusions so i need to stop</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">but yes the game be for me starts with</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:58.000" style="s2">freeing up</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">my time my energy and my agency from</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.000" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">external forces and when i do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">i&#39;ll be happy like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">and so i guess there&#39;s at least the two</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">different parts there&#39;s the actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">talking about the project</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">but then there is the kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:20.559" style="s2">build a system around</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">what would it take for somebody like me</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.559" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">or bentley or somebody who like</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">has skills that are in demand in game a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">and could make a you know a game a</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">salary and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">if you started a company be quite you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">off what are the advantages and i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">one of the advantages once the company</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">is established</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">is you take away the initial risk part</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">where you say yeah in game a if you were</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">to invest and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">to get a loan and invest your money</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:45.920" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously you taking a risk where</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">yeah in gay may you that you should have</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.920" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">some sort of payoff or you wouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:49.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">which kind of goes back to it it would</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.119" end="00:52:51.680" style="s2">be interesting if it was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">universal basic income</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.680" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re going to make this</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:56.800" style="s2">salary and you now at some point</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">maybe you don&#39;t have to work or don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.800" end="00:52:59.599" style="s2">have to work for the next year and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">you can focus your time on other game b</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.599" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">projects and other people take over</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:04.319" style="s2">right or you can find someone else or</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">something that would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.319" end="00:53:07.440" style="s2">thing because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:08.319" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.440" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">it rough about</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:11.839" style="s2">not having such a big the reason i was</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">able to take</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.839" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">all this time and work on game b</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">projects is because i</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:19.680" style="s2">you know made some extra you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.920" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">not working i haven&#39;t worked for six</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.680" end="00:53:24.400" style="s2">months</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">um but that&#39;s going to come to an end um</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.400" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">so it&#39;d be interesting yeah yeah if we</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:29.440" style="s2">could so it&#39;d be interesting to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">and figure out how to calculate what</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.440" end="00:53:32.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">that risk and that what the upside is</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.079" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">and what the limits are</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:37.280" style="s2">yeah and i think with this particular</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:39.839" style="s2">thing one of the advantages</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.280" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">is that risk to start a company is</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.839" end="00:53:42.400" style="s2">incredibly low</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">because you&#39;re working on somebody</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.400" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">else&#39;s infrastructure all you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:48.079" style="s2">learn that ecosystem which you know if</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">you plan to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.079" end="00:53:51.680" style="s2">other projects going forward is then</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">wasted time and the only potentially</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.680" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">waste of time is actually doing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">yeah it doesn&#39;t have as high of an</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.119" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">upside because you&#39;re on someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">and they can kick you off at any time</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">well yeah salesforce is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">solid there but and actually a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:06.000" style="s2">the projects</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">that have mined there&#39;s a good chance</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">that they would end up buying</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:12.400" style="s2">which then has a a different</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">conversation on what happens if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.400" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">acquires a game b project can they</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">and if they can then you know what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">game b payout</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">versus what goes back into this company</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">to help fund the other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.640" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;d be interesting to work out</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">all those a model kind of agreement and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:31.119" style="s2">that makes me think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:33.440" style="s2">protocol of is that one of them there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.119" end="00:54:35.280" style="s2">a couple places where they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.440" end="00:54:37.040" style="s2">kind of the agreements of organizations</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.280" end="00:54:40.319" style="s2">that are in this space of</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">not profit of not unlimited profit</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.319" end="00:54:43.920" style="s2">so it&#39;d be looking good to see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">already out there and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.920" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">yeah ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.839" end="00:54:53.119" style="s2">right this was a fruitful hour i&#39;m going</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">oh never mind then i just saw the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">private chat was that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:18.160" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be never mind if i would</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">read things we&#39;d be fine</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:21.920" style="s2">all right we can still hang out for</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">another few minutes uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.920" end="00:55:24.880" style="s2">i really i mean my vision in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">beginning when i first came into game b</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.880" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">was a netflix of apps right so people</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">were paying 10 bucks a month to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">access to a catalog of apps</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:33.440" style="s2">and the issue is we don&#39;t have any apps</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">so why would anyone put 10 a month in</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.440" end="00:55:36.559" style="s2">that being said if you had ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">people putting ten dollars a month in so</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.559" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">we could go</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">and buy apps so you could say hey what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">the most useful one</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">um my guess is there&#39;s tons of companies</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:45.200" style="s2">that would rather be bought by anyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">but google</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.200" end="00:55:48.480" style="s2">and they have that effect like they can</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">see how much competition there is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.480" end="00:55:50.799" style="s2">they&#39;re probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">gonna die away and if we just want them</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.799" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">for 10 000 people right the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">the team building ones and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">these different ones then</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">i think there would be a be a profitable</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:03.040" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">yeah i wonder if we were around</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.040" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">and had that money when good what was</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">the good thing that did the uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:11.760" style="s2">the good good the good guide yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:13.280" style="s2">that would have been something that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.760" end="00:56:15.520" style="s2">maybe they would have preferred to sell</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">to right large cooperative rather than</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.520" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">large companies</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">although there may have been problems</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">with scaling that the reason why i need</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">something bigger than that i</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">think it becomes an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:25.040" style="s2">conversation when you&#39;re acquiring</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:27.599" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.040" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">as a game b omni win because i think you</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.599" end="00:56:30.160" style="s2">would sort of end up going to a company</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.160" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">you&#39;re you have this value in a game a</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">world but</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">based on our charter we you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">our minimum wage</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">this is how much we pay people so if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:42.640" style="s2">were to take your company</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">and turn it you know into our model it</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.640" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">would actually be making this amount a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">year so we&#39;re only going to pay you x</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">like yeah so we would we&#39;d we&#39;d only be</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.799" end="00:56:55.040" style="s2">winning</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">a sale of that if they had a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.040" end="00:56:59.920" style="s2">aligned moral compass or even if their</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:01.839" style="s2">company was</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.920" end="00:57:02.960" style="s2">profitable enough for us to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.839" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">make those changes right</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.960" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">which is sort of saying we&#39;d only buy</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">companies that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">like sort of structured in a way to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">profitable</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.240" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">without underpaying people right like</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">if that&#39;s your business model yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">no we&#39;re not going to buy you right</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">the only thing is that in all of those</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">cases a gaming company will pay more</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:24.559" style="s2">than we will</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.319" end="00:57:26.079" style="s2">right so because they they pay on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.559" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">future potential</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.079" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">of the unlimited potential profit so</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:32.160" style="s2">there has to be a reason why a person</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:33.440" style="s2">would sell to us and like jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.160" end="00:57:34.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.440" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">people out there that wouldn&#39;t sell to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.799" end="00:57:38.559" style="s2">google because i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">a lot of the people that go into it are</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.559" end="00:57:42.960" style="s2">trying to be jeff bezos</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s also like it&#39;s not just that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.960" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">they yeah some people would definitely</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">sell to google</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">like if they&#39;re going to sell we pay you</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">know 100 million and we&#39;re paid 100 000</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:52.319" style="s2">clearly we know who you&#39;re going with</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to go with us</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.319" end="00:57:56.000" style="s2">but when there&#39;s competition in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">area right if we&#39;re instead of building</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.000" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">our own food app buying one</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.000" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">google&#39;s not going to buy them because</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re like we&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">recreate you and we&#39;re kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.280" style="s2">same position but you already exist you</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">already have a customer base</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.280" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">that you can bring on board and if</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">you&#39;re you can see that your thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">like that someone will pay you 100 000</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">instead of you just going into the ether</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:15.839" style="s2">and never</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:16.720" style="s2">existing anymore that is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.839" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">like we need a</p>

<p begin="00:58:21.359" end="00:58:24.799" style="s2">and in the beginning yeah no one&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">sell to us because we don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.799" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">have enough money we don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">but later on when um we are the option</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">cause it&#39;s like well if you sell the</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:34.640" style="s2">google won&#39;t have money because why like</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:36.160" style="s2">they&#39;re going to we will be acquiring</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:37.680" style="s2">more things or a company that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.160" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">structured like this right that is owned</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.680" end="00:58:41.119" style="s2">by humanity</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:42.960" style="s2">would would have more power but not in</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.119" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">the beginning you could like in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.960" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">later stages you could end up with sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">uh like i don&#39;t know the human resources</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">version of economies of scale and just</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">being efficient where when google buys a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">company in a lot of cases they just sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">leave that company alone and see if it</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.440" end="00:59:02.079" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:04.559" style="s2">can turn a profit as is and then see how</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.079" end="00:59:07.520" style="s2">how how they can tie into their system</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.559" end="00:59:10.640" style="s2">if the thing was hey a companies that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.520" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">acquire like well we might not need</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.640" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">the full-time marketing resources if</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">those marketing people get absorbed into</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:17.200" style="s2">this marketing team that&#39;s company-wide</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">where they can be working on a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.200" end="00:59:21.119" style="s2">stuff you might end up</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:22.079" style="s2">being able to be more profitable there</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.119" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">and i think what</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.079" end="00:59:26.240" style="s2">realistically what you&#39;d end up with is</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">most of the companies under the umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.240" end="00:59:29.920" style="s2">are companies that were started under it</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:31.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.920" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">if you have an idea you can either go to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.520" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">the game a world and say hey i want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">put up my own you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">my my my own money or if i&#39;m you know a</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">salesperson i&#39;m going to try to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.319" end="00:59:42.079" style="s2">investors and then i give up</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">a share of the company all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.079" end="00:59:45.440" style="s2">gaming stuff or we give them an option</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:47.119" style="s2">well you can come here</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.440" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">where we take away pretty much all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.119" end="00:59:50.480" style="s2">risk from that start</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:52.160" style="s2">but then you also don&#39;t get the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.480" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">payout so</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.160" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">d do you want like a huge payout but a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">huge amount of risk</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">or do you want a pretty decent payout</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="01:00:00.880" style="s2">from a minimal</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:02.640" style="s2">amount of risk and an organization you</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.880" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">know that you can feel good</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.640" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">being a part of</p>
