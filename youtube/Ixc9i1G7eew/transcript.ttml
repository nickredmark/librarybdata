<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:02.700" style="s2">PEPE&#39;S METAPHYSICS</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.700" end="00:00:07.400" style="s2"> The second part of the conversation between Dr. Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Page, recorded on November 7, 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.480" end="00:00:10.840" style="s2"> Peterson: Let&#39;s talk about frogs! Pajo: That&#39;s right! [laughs]</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.580" end="00:00:16.620" style="s2"> Pajo: Well, yes, huh ...</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.620" end="00:00:19.720" style="s2"> I mean, when I saw the video,</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.720" end="00:00:22.745" style="s2"> it seemed to be two days ago ... Peterson: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.745" end="00:00:25.360" style="s2"> Pajo: I couldn’t give faith!</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.360" end="00:00:28.520" style="s2"> And the next morning I got a letter from my brother, he&#39;s also studying symbolism,</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.520" end="00:00:30.985" style="s2"> and he is a very intelligent man, and he said:</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.985" end="00:00:34.015" style="s2"> &quot;Does Jordan know he embodies Pepe?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.020" end="00:00:36.560" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes! And the funniest thing, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.560" end="00:00:39.445" style="s2"> I knew about Pepe, but ...</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.445" end="00:00:42.800" style="s2"> I definitely didn&#39;t think about it all when I was making the video,</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.800" end="00:00:45.860" style="s2"> it never occurred to me that there was such a connection.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.860" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2"> I was more worried about this topic with Kermit,</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:51.200" style="s2"> which jumped about two years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.360" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs] Peterson: Someone said then, and I thought, &quot;Ha ...&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:00:58.720" style="s2"> and I went to listen to this Kermit, and thought:</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.720" end="00:00:59.660" style="s2"> &quot;Um, and the truth&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.155" end="00:01:02.415" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs] Peterson: My voice is really similar to Kermit&#39;s.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.420" end="00:01:04.300" style="s2"> You know, I can make it lower,</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.300" end="00:01:07.060" style="s2"> but my voice tends to rise into mine ... Pajo: Ha!</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2"> Peterson: In my ... [confused]</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.365" end="00:01:10.235" style="s2"> It’s all because of the tension.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.585" end="00:01:12.925" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs out loud] Peterson: And ...</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.925" end="00:01:15.580" style="s2"> Pajo: That&#39;s the thing! And now we are doing &quot;Pepe&#39;s Metaphysics&quot;!</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.580" end="00:01:18.320" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think anyone has done that yet. Peterson: Yes, that&#39;s right, that&#39;s right.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:19.935" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs] Peterson: You know,</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.940" end="00:01:22.325" style="s2"> it&#39;s a weird coincidence too,</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.325" end="00:01:24.300" style="s2"> also ... [confused]</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.300" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2"> arose in connection with this mask,</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.525" end="00:01:28.955" style="s2"> or the hat I wore. Pajo: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:31.655" style="s2"> She is very similar to Pepe. Peterson: I know! She even has</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.660" end="00:01:34.460" style="s2"> red lips! It&#39;s just incredible! Pajo: Yes!</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.700" end="00:01:37.900" style="s2"> Peterson: I almost fainted when I posted this video,</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.900" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2"> and people began to point to a coincidence with Pepe.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:44.835" style="s2"> Seriously, I almost fainted. It happens to me infrequently.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.835" end="00:01:45.835" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs]</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.020" end="00:01:47.965" style="s2"> Peterson: I can only remember once</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.965" end="00:01:51.340" style="s2"> in my life when I was so shocked I almost fainted.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.340" end="00:01:54.440" style="s2"> I thought it was too much for me.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.440" end="00:01:56.760" style="s2"> And then how to think about coincidences with frogs</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.765" end="00:01:58.200" style="s2"> after that ...</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.200" end="00:02:01.815" style="s2"> [confused] It&#39;s just ... well ...</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.815" end="00:02:05.235" style="s2"> This is an indescribably absurd thing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.240" end="00:02:08.480" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes. Peterson: So much of this has been indescribably absurd ...</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.480" end="00:02:10.460" style="s2"> I don&#39;t even know what I wrote on Twitter yesterday ...</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.460" end="00:02:13.425" style="s2"> I looked like &quot;Value Maps,&quot; my book,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.425" end="00:02:16.795" style="s2"> placed on the Amazon list,</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.795" end="00:02:19.725" style="s2"> just to inquire, and it was the eighth book</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.725" end="00:02:22.735" style="s2"> in the list of books related to behaviorism.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.735" end="00:02:26.195" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes. Peterson: And she was surrounded by two books,</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.195" end="00:02:28.575" style="s2"> Mazarin Banazhi&#39;s book is a woman,</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.575" end="00:02:30.285" style="s2"> who invented the test for unconscious associations,</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.285" end="00:02:32.965" style="s2"> used to find in a person some unconscious settings,</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.965" end="00:02:35.845" style="s2"> Pajo: My God ... Peterson: And the second book is by Richard Bandler,</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.845" end="00:02:38.175" style="s2"> which seems to have been called &quot;Frogs and Princesses.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.795" end="00:02:39.795" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs]</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.535" end="00:02:42.735" style="s2"> Peterson: And then I learned about Keck,</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.735" end="00:02:45.755" style="s2"> I didn&#39;t know anything about Keck, and ... [confused] Anyway, it&#39;s ...</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.755" end="00:02:48.615" style="s2"> And today I thought when I watched Nina Paley,</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.615" end="00:02:51.695" style="s2"> she’s just a genius, she made a cartoon</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.695" end="00:02:54.055" style="s2"> of the plagues of God, which Moses sent upon Pharaoh,</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.055" end="00:02:57.055" style="s2"> and one of them was barking frogs.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.055" end="00:03:00.035" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes. Peterson: And as a result ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.035" end="00:03:03.175" style="s2"> Pajo: The result is a frog - the perfect liminal character,</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.175" end="00:03:06.085" style="s2"> because the frog ... seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.085" end="00:03:09.205" style="s2"> you also did a tweet about it, the frog lives</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.205" end="00:03:12.165" style="s2"> and in the water, and on land, and so it ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.165" end="00:03:15.295" style="s2"> she is like a demon because she can</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.295" end="00:03:18.615" style="s2"> travel between different universes.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:22.285" style="s2"> And this can be seen in fairy tales,</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.285" end="00:03:25.600" style="s2"> as, for example, &quot;The Frog and the Princess&quot; is a perfect example,</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.600" end="00:03:30.240" style="s2"> there is also a connection with Pinocchio, we talked about this before.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.240" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2"> It turns out like - the princess goes to the pond, she plays with his</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.860" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2"> favorite toy - with a golden ball, and she lets him in, he falls into the pond ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.045" end="00:03:39.675" style="s2"> Peterson: Here we need to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.675" end="00:03:42.945" style="s2"> the golden ball is also a snitch in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.945" end="00:03:45.245" style="s2"> which needs to be caught in Quidditch.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.245" end="00:03:49.315" style="s2"> And it&#39;s funny, because the snitch has a part of the soul of Val de Morta, huh?</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.320" end="00:03:52.200" style="s2"> And it turns out that this is part of the soul of evil</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:03:57.095" style="s2"> inside the golden ball. And this ball has wings,</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.100" end="00:04:01.300" style="s2"> and it literally means “Shar Chaos”. Technically speaking, it is an alchemical symbol.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.300" end="00:04:04.820" style="s2"> The &quot;Ball of Chaos&quot; is a symbol of Mercury,</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.825" end="00:04:08.115" style="s2"> and Mercury is the ambassador of the gods.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.115" end="00:04:11.105" style="s2"> As a result, the gods are talking to you,</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.105" end="00:04:14.800" style="s2"> when something trembles in front of you and catches your attention.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.875" end="00:04:17.245" style="s2"> Pajo: Ugh. Peterson: And in Quidditch</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.245" end="00:04:20.040" style="s2"> the person who follows what attracts attention,</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2"> &quot;Catcher&quot;, one who seeks a snitch,</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:25.195" style="s2"> and it&#39;s also the one who wins not only in the game,</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.195" end="00:04:28.465" style="s2"> but in the metagame too. Pajo: What is important to understand -</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.465" end="00:04:31.275" style="s2"> the ball is the most significant thing. Peterson: Yes!</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.275" end="00:04:34.065" style="s2"> That’s why it’s golden. He is like the sun.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.065" end="00:04:37.245" style="s2"> Pajo: It embodies the idea of ​​the most significant thing. And she loses the ball.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.245" end="00:04:40.215" style="s2"> He falls into the water and is out of there.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.215" end="00:04:43.185" style="s2"> She loses the most significant thing, and the thing falls into Chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.185" end="00:04:46.135" style="s2"> Peterson: It’s like God’s death. Like a loss of value.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.135" end="00:04:48.965" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes! Or as the idea of ​​losing virtue.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.965" end="00:04:50.885" style="s2"> Or, you know, anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.885" end="00:04:53.885" style="s2"> why you attach importance.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.885" end="00:04:56.945" style="s2"> And here is the frog,</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.945" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2"> and the frog says, “I can bring back your ball,</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2"> if you promise me something ... &quot;. And this promise - the princess must promise,</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:10.700" style="s2"> that will take the frog to his castle, and the frog will eat with it</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.705" end="00:05:13.735" style="s2"> and also sleep with her in her bed, right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.735" end="00:05:16.865" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes, that&#39;s right. Pajo: And here are these two things - food and sex.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.865" end="00:05:19.955" style="s2"> We’ve talked about this before. And so, the frog dives into the pond</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.960" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2"> and returns this most significant thing.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:28.480" style="s2"> And the princess is forced to accept the ball and fulfill the promise.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.500" end="00:05:31.580" style="s2"> She doesn’t want to do it, she doesn’t want to at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.585" end="00:05:34.665" style="s2"> let the frog to himself in the castle,</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.665" end="00:05:38.155" style="s2"> giving to eat from her plate and sleep in her bed.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.245" end="00:05:41.495" style="s2"> But she does it - and the frog turns into a prince.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.495" end="00:05:44.915" style="s2"> Here it is, this is an idea we talked about earlier -</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.915" end="00:05:47.455" style="s2"> the most significant thing disappears in Chaos,</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.455" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2"> and what can bring her back -</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:54.305" style="s2"> right? - what can bring her back,</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.305" end="00:05:56.885" style="s2"> can be tamed, right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.885" end="00:05:59.685" style="s2"> And can enter our world, find a place here. Peterson: Yes, that&#39;s right.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.685" end="00:06:03.015" style="s2"> And perhaps itself is gaining supreme importance.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.015" end="00:06:05.935" style="s2"> Pajo: That&#39;s right. Peterson: And here&#39;s something to think about.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.935" end="00:06:08.475" style="s2"> Concerning marriage, for example -</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.475" end="00:06:11.165" style="s2"> people always ... and I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.165" end="00:06:14.025" style="s2"> through the significant impermanence of our culture,</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.025" end="00:06:16.995" style="s2"> people are always rushing everywhere looking for the perfect partner,</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.995" end="00:06:18.715" style="s2"> which would be perfect for them,</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:21.500" style="s2"> and, you know, think -</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.500" end="00:06:25.720" style="s2"> if you find the perfect partner, he or she will run away from you screaming at the same moment.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.720" end="00:06:28.140" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs] Peterson: It turns out</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.140" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2"> this ideality needs to be built in a relationship,</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:35.900" style="s2"> if you accept a partner in all imperfections.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.900" end="00:06:37.885" style="s2"> And hope your partner will do the same.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.885" end="00:06:40.565" style="s2"> You have to swear to each other that you will not run away.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.565" end="00:06:45.500" style="s2"> And as a result, you can embark on a mutual transformation process,</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.555" end="00:06:48.505" style="s2"> which becomes possible as you tell each other the truth.</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.505" end="00:06:51.145" style="s2"> And having a sincere relationship ...</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.145" end="00:06:53.385" style="s2"> I mean, as a consequence of that -</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.385" end="00:06:55.155" style="s2"> a transformation will take place.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.155" end="00:06:58.305" style="s2"> You can start with a frog, but she can turn into a prince.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.305" end="00:07:01.675" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes! This is exactly what we were talking about.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.675" end="00:07:04.125" style="s2"> This is the structure of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.125" end="00:07:07.225" style="s2"> This is on a personal level,</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.225" end="00:07:10.205" style="s2"> that&#39;s what it is on a social level ... Peterson: Yes, that&#39;s right.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.205" end="00:07:13.495" style="s2"> Pajo: A little hint: we&#39;ve talked about the story of Abraham before,</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.495" end="00:07:16.485" style="s2"> as three angels came to him and announced,</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.485" end="00:07:19.415" style="s2"> that he will have a son.</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.415" end="00:07:22.495" style="s2"> The same thing happens in the tale of the sleeping beauty.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.495" end="00:07:25.715" style="s2"> The queen goes to the pond, and there</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.715" end="00:07:28.755" style="s2"> she is greeted by a talking frog.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.755" end="00:07:32.175" style="s2"> And the frog declares that the queen</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.175" end="00:07:35.315" style="s2"> a baby will be born, the most beautiful baby in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.315" end="00:07:38.495" style="s2"> Here it is, it’s the idea of ​​something going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.495" end="00:07:40.835" style="s2"> from Chaos ... Peterson: Yeah, and that&#39;s an interesting idea,</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.835" end="00:07:42.705" style="s2"> for, you know, in the diagrams</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.705" end="00:07:45.445" style="s2"> in my book, in &quot;Value Maps&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.445" end="00:07:48.195" style="s2"> one of the diagrams is an egg,</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.200" end="00:07:51.575" style="s2"> which is the Chaos in which things sink.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.575" end="00:07:55.240" style="s2"> But Chaos is an absolute state, in a sense,</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.245" end="00:07:57.545" style="s2"> it is a state of uncertainty as such.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.545" end="00:08:00.195" style="s2"> And we do not perceive the unknown as such.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.195" end="00:08:03.835" style="s2"> We always perceive only what is partly known or partly unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.835" end="00:08:06.525" style="s2"> And it’s just about a frog sitting by a pond.</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.525" end="00:08:09.515" style="s2"> The frog lets you ... so to speak,</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:11.935" style="s2"> the frog is the ambassador of Chaos, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.935" end="00:08:16.255" style="s2"> And you always meet only with the ambassador of Chaos, but not with Chaos itself.</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.255" end="00:08:19.285" style="s2"> Peterson: It&#39;s like ... it&#39;s like ... [confused] Pajo: It&#39;s nonsense.</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.285" end="00:08:21.845" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes, that&#39;s right! Pajo: It&#39;s out of being,</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.845" end="00:08:24.805" style="s2"> below being, if you will. Peterson: Exactly.</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.805" end="00:08:27.695" style="s2"> Pajo: And now, if you think about it ... two things -</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.695" end="00:08:30.505" style="s2"> the first thing that’s interesting, then, is that frog Kermit</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.505" end="00:08:32.200" style="s2"> also all this!</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.245" end="00:08:35.485" style="s2"> Kermit is the host, he hosts the show,</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.485" end="00:08:38.475" style="s2"> and what does he do? He makes the transition</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.475" end="00:08:41.505" style="s2"> between different worlds.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.505" end="00:08:44.545" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes. Pajo: And lo and behold, there is action,</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.545" end="00:08:47.645" style="s2"> and there is this figure of transition that appears, and a new action begins.</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.645" end="00:08:50.825" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes! Pajo: It&#39;s the role of Kermit&#39;s frog,</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.825" end="00:08:53.765" style="s2"> which he plays in this puppet show.</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.765" end="00:08:56.155" style="s2"> Peterson: And his main problem is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:08:57.880" style="s2"> Miss Piggy, this tumultuous feminist.</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.880" end="00:09:01.240" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs out loud] What a laugh! Peterson: [smiles]</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.240" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2"> Pajo: Yeah, well, now about Pepe, because we&#39;re still doing &quot;Pepe&#39;s Metaphysics.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes. Pajo: That&#39;s what&#39;s going on in the world -</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2"> a strange situation in which people -</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:16.220" style="s2"> call them right, or forces of order,</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.220" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2"> or ... [confused] or ...</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:21.855" style="s2"> let&#39;s say the norm. People who create the norm</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.860" end="00:09:24.865" style="s2"> for the whole public, right? Peterson: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.865" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2"> Pajo: And here&#39;s a situation where things turned upside down.</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.005" end="00:09:31.015" style="s2"> People who were previously narratively destined to create the norm,</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.015" end="00:09:34.035" style="s2"> now make marginals.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.035" end="00:09:37.165" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes. Pajo: They are being pushed to the margins, right?</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.165" end="00:09:40.175" style="s2"> Peterson: That&#39;s right. Pajo: And they are told: &quot;You created the norm -</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.175" end="00:09:43.545" style="s2"> and now we will squeeze you out, make you marginalized. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.545" end="00:09:46.445" style="s2"> Peterson: And so you think they tied themselves to a frog?</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.445" end="00:09:49.675" style="s2"> Pajo: Yeah, so they tied themselves to a frog! Peterson: Oh, my God ...</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.675" end="00:09:52.775" style="s2"> Pajo: That&#39;s what happened - there was a strange inversion,</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.775" end="00:09:55.775" style="s2"> the power of inversion and the power of ridicule,</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.775" end="00:09:58.735" style="s2"> the power ... of humor - usually</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.740" end="00:10:01.800" style="s2"> on the side of Chaos. This is usually ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.820" end="00:10:03.980" style="s2"> the power of the marginal, without any questions.</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.980" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes!</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.885" end="00:10:07.675" style="s2"> And I noticed that ... it seems to have started twenty years ago -</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.675" end="00:10:11.045" style="s2"> all ... all comedians have become right!</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.545" end="00:10:14.665" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs] Peterson: I thought - what the hell ?! What&#39;s going on ?!</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.665" end="00:10:17.225" style="s2"> The right wing usually has no comedians, all comedians in the left!</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.225" end="00:10:20.180" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes! Peterson: The left pokes the right and laughs.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.180" end="00:10:23.300" style="s2"> It&#39;s very strange that comedians ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.300" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2"> that the right wing began to manifest itself in comedy.</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.745" end="00:10:29.475" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes! This is a sign that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.475" end="00:10:32.425" style="s2"> that a strange inversion occurred,</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.425" end="00:10:35.115" style="s2"> and there is an interesting, as it were ... [confused]</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.115" end="00:10:37.645" style="s2"> interesting thing: the bible has a story,</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.645" end="00:10:40.755" style="s2"> which tells of this - the story of the prophet Elijah.</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.755" end="00:10:43.625" style="s2"> In the days when he lived, Israel, as it were,</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.625" end="00:10:46.765" style="s2"> worshiped false gods, as Queen Isabel wanted.</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.765" end="00:10:49.945" style="s2"> Right? And Elijah, the one who was supposed to be a prophet</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.945" end="00:10:52.620" style="s2"> the true God of these people,</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.620" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2"> was made a marginal character.</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:10:57.700" style="s2"> His name is Ilya the Wanderer.</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.700" end="00:11:00.780" style="s2"> Peterson: God ... Pajo: And that&#39;s weird, because he has to be a prophet of God,</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.785" end="00:11:03.905" style="s2"> but his instrument of prophecy is mockery.</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.905" end="00:11:06.925" style="s2"> He mocks the prophets of Baal,</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.925" end="00:11:09.865" style="s2"> and this, you know, is not something you would normally find in the Bible,</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.865" end="00:11:12.715" style="s2"> when ridicule becomes a tool for restoring order.</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.715" end="00:11:15.785" style="s2"> And this is what we see in Pepe’s characters.</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.785" end="00:11:19.480" style="s2"> Pepe is like an inversion machine.</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.000" end="00:11:23.935" style="s2"> People who use it, what do they do?</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.935" end="00:11:26.945" style="s2"> They take insults that fly in their direction,</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.945" end="00:11:29.675" style="s2"> and they turn them over,</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.675" end="00:11:31.905" style="s2"> return them to those from whom they flew.</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.905" end="00:11:34.765" style="s2"> That’s what you’ve done with this “kermit” theme, and it’s perfect.</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.765" end="00:11:37.675" style="s2"> People make fun of you, say your voice is like Kermit&#39;s,</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.675" end="00:11:40.595" style="s2"> and you say, “Okay, I accept that,</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.595" end="00:11:46.355" style="s2"> and I will make it my strong point. ” Pepe does the same.</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.355" end="00:11:49.295" style="s2"> There are a lot of very crazy pieces made with it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.295" end="00:11:52.465" style="s2"> There are a lot of very dark traits in Pepe&#39;s character,</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.465" end="00:11:54.125" style="s2"> you know things I wouldn’t touch.</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.125" end="00:11:56.585" style="s2"> Peterson: Huh, you know, when I first saw the frog,</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.585" end="00:11:59.955" style="s2"> Pepe the frog, I was a little wary.</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.005" end="00:12:02.575" style="s2"> It contains some element of comic hidden horror.</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.575" end="00:12:05.595" style="s2"> To me, this element seemed disgusting.</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.595" end="00:12:08.435" style="s2"> So, you know, unknowingly disgusting.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.435" end="00:12:11.095" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes. But, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.095" end="00:12:14.115" style="s2"> it is as if its purpose. Peterson: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.115" end="00:12:20.255" style="s2"> Pajo: And this formulates the power of those who use it.</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.260" end="00:12:23.400" style="s2"> This can be seen even in the first comic where it appeared.</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.560" end="00:12:26.700" style="s2"> Stupid such a comic. Here&#39;s a frog,</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.700" end="00:12:29.615" style="s2"> walking ... [confused] to the toilet, pee,</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.615" end="00:12:32.615" style="s2"> but lowers his trousers all the way to his ankles.</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.615" end="00:12:35.575" style="s2"> And she does something like that - usually</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.575" end="00:12:38.725" style="s2"> when you lower your pants to your ankles, you sit down and do a little different,</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.775" end="00:12:41.795" style="s2"> but the frog does it standing up, and here it is, this element ...</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.795" end="00:12:45.085" style="s2"> He shows us his ass.</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.085" end="00:12:47.080" style="s2"> And here it is - this power of inversion,</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.080" end="00:12:50.100" style="s2"> which gives a person the opportunity to ascend again. [laughs]</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.145" end="00:12:53.115" style="s2"> This is a double inversion -</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.115" end="00:12:56.355" style="s2"> that’s what people enjoy when they use these images.</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.355" end="00:12:59.365" style="s2"> As you supposedly know</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.365" end="00:13:02.525" style="s2"> allegedly radical leftists tell them:</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.525" end="00:13:05.745" style="s2"> &quot;You are white men in control, blah blah blah ...&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.745" end="00:13:08.865" style="s2"> that&#39;s all, and the people who enjoy Pepe,</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.865" end="00:13:11.915" style="s2"> they say, &quot;Ha!&quot; And they reflect</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.915" end="00:13:15.355" style="s2"> it&#39;s back and then ... the people who blame them,</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.355" end="00:13:18.645" style="s2"> just going crazy. Just going crazy</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.645" end="00:13:21.495" style="s2"> but all they do is say, “Well, you call me a racist,</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.495" end="00:13:24.505" style="s2"> blah blah blah ... ”and they reflect that,</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.505" end="00:13:27.525" style="s2"> return and overturn,</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.525" end="00:13:30.555" style="s2"> they say, “Okay. I&#39;ll show you who you call me. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.555" end="00:13:33.545" style="s2"> And then, you know, the left,</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.545" end="00:13:36.805" style="s2"> the radical left is just raging. And this, you know, a little ...</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.805" end="00:13:40.125" style="s2"> If you look at this people, the “alternative right,”</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.125" end="00:13:43.545" style="s2"> they have this amazing magical power, huh?</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.885" end="00:13:46.935" style="s2"> Look at Miley, Miley Yanopolis,</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.935" end="00:13:49.985" style="s2"> he is just a perfect example. You know, here you are -</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.985" end="00:13:53.255" style="s2"> half Greek, half Jew, gay Catholic,</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.255" end="00:13:56.305" style="s2"> supports Trump, Peterson: Englishman!</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.305" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes, an Englishman in America ...</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.695" end="00:14:00.835" style="s2"> and ... Peterson: And he&#39;s arguing with Republicans.</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.835" end="00:14:04.125" style="s2"> Pajo: That&#39;s right! People can&#39;t touch anything in it,</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.125" end="00:14:07.295" style="s2"> for he is like a frog, he is literally</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.295" end="00:14:09.825" style="s2"> this marginalized figure,</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.825" end="00:14:13.065" style="s2"> which stands somewhere aside - but, you know, it’s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.065" end="00:14:15.895" style="s2"> twice turned over, it seems ...</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.895" end="00:14:19.015" style="s2"> don&#39;t know if he intended it but looks like</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.015" end="00:14:22.065" style="s2"> that he restores order through this double coup. Very strange.</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.065" end="00:14:24.775" style="s2"> Peterson: Indeed, it is very strange.</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.775" end="00:14:26.375" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs]</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.375" end="00:14:29.465" style="s2"> Anyway ... I would say ...</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.465" end="00:14:32.445" style="s2"> Be careful. It&#39;s dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.445" end="00:14:34.365" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes. Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.365" end="00:14:36.995" style="s2"> I try very hard to be careful.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.995" end="00:14:39.875" style="s2"> Trust me, I talk to a lot of people,</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.875" end="00:14:42.195" style="s2"> which help me formulate arguments,</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.195" end="00:14:44.415" style="s2"> label them correctly ... I do my best</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.425" end="00:14:49.615" style="s2"> I don&#39;t have to be angry.</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.615" end="00:14:52.405" style="s2"> After all, I’m really in Chaos. Pajo: Yes!</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.405" end="00:14:54.485" style="s2"> Peterson: And don’t think it’s like a disaster.</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.485" end="00:14:57.355" style="s2"> I don’t know what will happen to me next.</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.355" end="00:15:00.365" style="s2"> I don’t know if it’s the worst or the best thing that has happened to me.</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.365" end="00:15:03.155" style="s2"> I can&#39;t say ... Pajo: Yes. And a solution to the situation,</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.155" end="00:15:06.035" style="s2"> when you get into Chaos,</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.040" end="00:15:11.700" style="s2"> when Jonah is dragged by a whale, right into the depths of the ocean ...</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.705" end="00:15:14.615" style="s2"> while he&#39;s in the whale&#39;s belly,</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.615" end="00:15:17.705" style="s2"> to him comes the decision.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.705" end="00:15:20.715" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes! Pajo: There comes this moment of discovery,</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.715" end="00:15:23.755" style="s2"> if it rolls over -</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.755" end="00:15:26.685" style="s2"> the discovery is to roll over,</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.685" end="00:15:29.855" style="s2"> and in that moment is the moment of his death,</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.855" end="00:15:32.905" style="s2"> which becomes the moment of his baptism and he goes out,</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.905" end="00:15:35.915" style="s2"> and he returns to the city, yes,</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.915" end="00:15:38.715" style="s2"> that&#39;s another part, but ... [confused]</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.715" end="00:15:41.465" style="s2"> The solution to get out of Chaos -</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.465" end="00:15:42.875" style="s2"> now it&#39;s not very ... Peterson: Yes,</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.875" end="00:15:45.565" style="s2"> and this is a big problem.</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.565" end="00:15:48.115" style="s2"> You need to move very deep into Chaos to find a solution.</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.115" end="00:15:51.195" style="s2"> Pajo: [laughs] And there&#39;s always a risk of losing</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.195" end="00:15:53.375" style="s2"> yourself when you’re in Chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.375" end="00:15:56.165" style="s2"> Peterson: Yes, that&#39;s right. That&#39;s the thing with dragons -</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.165" end="00:15:57.655" style="s2"> they can eat you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.655" end="00:16:00.065" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes, they can eat you. Peterson: That&#39;s ... That&#39;s why me</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.065" end="00:16:03.045" style="s2"> dislikes the “new age” of Jung’s thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.045" end="00:16:05.525" style="s2"> It seems Joseph Campbell was a little responsible for that,</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.525" end="00:16:08.285" style="s2"> although he did a lot of useful work.</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.285" end="00:16:10.945" style="s2"> But the essence of the confrontation with</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.945" end="00:16:13.355" style="s2"> what are you afraid of - that it&#39;s scary, and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.355" end="00:16:16.355" style="s2"> that it can eat you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.355" end="00:16:19.315" style="s2"> And it has already eaten a lot of people to you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.035" end="00:16:23.035" style="s2"> And it&#39;s no joke to you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.035" end="00:16:24.675" style="s2"> And during all this ...</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.275" end="00:16:28.115" style="s2"> call it the &quot;path traveled&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.115" end="00:16:30.865" style="s2"> I mean - what will happen?</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.865" end="00:16:34.175" style="s2"> Especially during the first few weeks,</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.215" end="00:16:35.865" style="s2"> when I was called a transphobe, a geek,</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.865" end="00:16:38.805" style="s2"> here are all these insults and I was just trampled,</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.805" end="00:16:41.285" style="s2"> the least inside my university, for my views,</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.285" end="00:16:43.345" style="s2"> and it was not at all obvious</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.345" end="00:16:45.935" style="s2"> that the moment will come ... as if ... [confused]</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.935" end="00:16:48.835" style="s2"> that it will be possible to emerge from all this, so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.835" end="00:16:52.205" style="s2"> Pajo: Huh ... But that, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.205" end="00:16:54.875" style="s2"> it worries me a lot since now</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.875" end="00:16:57.885" style="s2"> we have as if two monsters are fighting each other.</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.885" end="00:17:01.065" style="s2"> On the one hand - this frog Pepe,</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.065" end="00:17:04.285" style="s2"> which, incidentally, has already been defined as a symbol of hatred</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.285" end="00:17:06.465" style="s2"> in the Anti-Defamation League. Do you know about this?</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.465" end="00:17:10.325" style="s2"> And it’s just awful. Terrible that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.325" end="00:17:13.225" style="s2"> everything has gone so far.</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.225" end="00:17:16.275" style="s2"> You know, all of a sudden ...</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.280" end="00:17:19.305" style="s2"> They may see a monster on the other side, however</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.305" end="00:17:22.280" style="s2"> don&#39;t see her on your own. Peterson: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.285" end="00:17:25.300" style="s2"> Pajo: And LGBTQ ... so on, so on,</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.305" end="00:17:27.660" style="s2"> I mean, and there are ... [confused]</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.660" end="00:17:31.060" style="s2"> liminal form.</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.080" end="00:17:34.075" style="s2"> Peterson: Just look at what’s going on with that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.075" end="00:17:37.100" style="s2"> The same thing happened with gender neutral pronouns.</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.195" end="00:17:39.185" style="s2"> They broke the duality, the endless division began</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.185" end="00:17:41.345" style="s2"> potential identities.</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.345" end="00:17:43.455" style="s2"> So Chaos manifests itself.</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.455" end="00:17:45.375" style="s2"> All these letters are just growing</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.375" end="00:17:48.455" style="s2"> on the acronym LGBT.</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.455" end="00:17:51.485" style="s2"> This is an example of just this:</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.485" end="00:17:54.325" style="s2"> &quot;We are marginals ...&quot; - &quot;Yes, we are also marginals!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.325" end="00:17:57.575" style="s2"> “What about us? We are also marginalized! ”</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.575" end="00:18:00.295" style="s2"> And I think it’s partly through that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.295" end="00:18:01.895" style="s2"> each person is in some sense a marginal.</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.895" end="00:18:03.845" style="s2"> At least one element in it,</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.845" end="00:18:06.875" style="s2"> apparently small, but it’s a seriously marginal element.</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.875" end="00:18:08.395" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.765" end="00:18:11.845" style="s2"> And I wonder how the rainbow became a symbol,</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.845" end="00:18:14.925" style="s2"> an ideal symbol of this community.</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.925" end="00:18:17.500" style="s2"> The rainbow is literally endless.</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.515" end="00:18:20.675" style="s2"> It is very fluid. Very fluid.</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.675" end="00:18:23.575" style="s2"> There are not seven colors in a rainbow, a rainbow is a spectrum of colors,</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.575" end="00:18:26.855" style="s2"> it contains Chaos itself,</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.855" end="00:18:29.535" style="s2"> it is the division of the Order into an indefinite number</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.535" end="00:18:31.205" style="s2"> different things.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.205" end="00:18:33.485" style="s2"> Yes? And we highlight seven colors in the rainbow,</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.485" end="00:18:36.405" style="s2"> but really ...</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.405" end="00:18:38.815" style="s2"> the rainbow is a spectrum of colors. Peterson: Yes, yes.</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.815" end="00:18:41.905" style="s2"> Pajo: She’s vaguely big. It can be divided</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.905" end="00:18:44.925" style="s2"> on an infinite number of pieces. Peterson: Yes. Pajo: No limits,</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.925" end="00:18:45.005" style="s2"> to which it can be divided.</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.005" end="00:18:48.055" style="s2"> Peterson: And it seems to me that this is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.055" end="00:18:50.795" style="s2"> of the law of identities - as if ...</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.905" end="00:18:53.605" style="s2"> well ... imagine ...</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.605" end="00:18:55.715" style="s2"> Identity is a very important thing.</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.715" end="00:18:57.825" style="s2"> Identity is something you always have.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.865" end="00:18:59.625" style="s2"> And identity is also something we give out.</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.625" end="00:19:02.045" style="s2"> And you need to include your identity</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.045" end="00:19:05.025" style="s2"> into the world of society. It is in a sense a game.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.025" end="00:19:08.045" style="s2"> There must also be a function in identity.</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.045" end="00:19:11.385" style="s2"> That&#39;s why this law is so dangerously harmful -</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.385" end="00:19:13.800" style="s2"> it says, &quot;Your identity can be whatever you want.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.800" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2"> No, she can&#39;t! You need to live with other people!</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.085" end="00:19:21.125" style="s2"> It&#39;s like saying, &quot;You can play any game you want.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.125" end="00:19:24.125" style="s2"> You can&#39;t because ...</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.125" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2"> Pajo: We need to play together! Peterson: You need other people to play!</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2"> Pajo: Yes, we play together! Peterson: You could say:</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.220" end="00:19:30.280" style="s2"> &quot;Play my game!&quot; - but even small children,</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.285" end="00:19:32.705" style="s2"> that play on the school playground when they say:</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.705" end="00:19:35.585" style="s2"> &quot;Play my game!&quot; - they are simply expelled. Pajo: Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.585" end="00:19:38.115" style="s2"> Peterson: The game itself has to be playable.</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.115" end="00:19:40.135" style="s2"> This is a completely different thing. There are ... There are ... [confused]</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.135" end="00:19:42.715" style="s2"> There are games that can be played and games that cannot be played.</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.715" end="00:19:45.565" style="s2"> And there&#39;s one thing that Piaget, a child development psychologist, pointed out,</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.565" end="00:19:47.780" style="s2"> Piaget - about games:</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.780" end="00:19:51.175" style="s2"> One of the hallmarks of an acceptable game is that people</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.175" end="00:19:52.755" style="s2"> want to play it voluntarily.</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.775" end="00:19:55.645" style="s2"> And here is the second part of the law, in which everything is very bad:</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.645" end="00:19:57.505" style="s2"> you have a game</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.505" end="00:20:01.985" style="s2"> and this is a game that you have chosen subjectively - so it is written in the law -</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.985" end="00:20:04.855" style="s2"> &quot;If you&#39;re next to me, you have to play my game.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.025" end="00:20:07.635" style="s2"> Like it or not.</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.635" end="00:20:09.875" style="s2"> And the problem lies in this ...</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.875" end="00:20:13.245" style="s2"> well, where is the limit? And the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.245" end="00:20:15.395" style="s2"> there is no limit, it is an infinite division.</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.185" end="00:20:19.425" style="s2"> The whole goal of the public is to make everyone play the game,</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.425" end="00:20:21.885" style="s2"> which will be more or less fair to which all,</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.885" end="00:20:25.305" style="s2"> in part, can join, albeit by donating part of themselves,</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.305" end="00:20:28.365" style="s2"> but so can you defeat Chaos,</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.365" end="00:20:31.900" style="s2"> The chaos of war of all against all, for example -</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.940" end="00:20:34.280" style="s2"> the dream of the Hobbesian legal system.</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.285" end="00:20:36.295" style="s2"> Life is short, hard and hard.</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.645" end="00:20:41.395" style="s2"> Pajo: It’s an addition to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.395" end="00:20:44.035" style="s2"> about the metaphysics of the frog Pepe, which I conducted with Dr. Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.135" end="00:20:48.045" style="s2"> Strange changes are taking place in our world.</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.195" end="00:20:51.015" style="s2"> And hopefully, if we can understand them,</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.020" end="00:20:52.520" style="s2"> we will be able to dodge evil.</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.660" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2"> As I discussed with Dr. Peterson,</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:57.260" style="s2"> the frog is a chaotic symbol.</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.260" end="00:21:01.060" style="s2"> Like an amphibian, it exists in two worlds simultaneously,</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.060" end="00:21:03.375" style="s2"> therefore it becomes an image of something borderline between these worlds.</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.105" end="00:21:08.075" style="s2"> Another possible aspect of this border is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:10.800" style="s2"> in the monster when we meet her -</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.800" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2"> shape change. This change, like hybridity -</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.180" style="s2"> a sign that we are in a place where categories fall apart, on the very edge of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:21.560" style="s2"> In the case of a change in shape this characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.565" end="00:21:24.695" style="s2"> emerges as a strength of borderline characters.</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.015" end="00:21:26.975" style="s2"> This is the power of fluidity.</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.035" end="00:21:29.465" style="s2"> Like the Trickster Chmut, which takes several forms,</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.465" end="00:21:30.915" style="s2"> to commit his mischievous deed.</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.385" end="00:21:35.900" style="s2"> To fully understand what the frog Pepe embodies,</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.935" end="00:21:39.255" style="s2"> we need to understand how the change of form takes place,</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.255" end="00:21:41.805" style="s2"> and how it gives preference to those who possess it.</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.635" end="00:21:44.585" style="s2"> Pepe the Frog is a meme.</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.045" end="00:21:47.895" style="s2"> Perhaps even the most popular meme of all time.</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.895" end="00:21:50.125" style="s2"> Pepe’s images just ignited the internet.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.805" end="00:21:53.155" style="s2"> And anyone in the world can make such an image.</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.035" end="00:21:57.465" style="s2"> So there are thousands and thousands of images of Pepe.</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.125" end="00:22:01.145" style="s2"> And these images are of different kinds - from the glorified emoticon</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.145" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2"> to fecal perversions, horrible so much you can’t imagine.</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.580" end="00:22:08.700" style="s2"> And because Pepe became this chaotic,</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.700" end="00:22:11.260" style="s2"> fluid, changeable character -</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.260" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2"> it becomes a mirror.</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.265" end="00:22:16.935" style="s2"> Just like water can also be a mirror.</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.605" end="00:22:20.600" style="s2"> And it turns out because</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.645" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2"> that there are so many images of Pepe,</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.060" end="00:22:28.200" style="s2"> when people look at this chaotic set of images,</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:30.780" style="s2"> they can’t “process” them all.</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.265" end="00:22:33.295" style="s2"> They need to first divide them into categories.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.975" end="00:22:36.100" style="s2"> And to bring them into categories,</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.155" end="00:22:39.395" style="s2"> they apply their own patterns of thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.060" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2"> As if reflecting their thinking on this chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.180" end="00:22:47.380" style="s2"> And, forcing chaos to take shape ...</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.805" end="00:22:51.455" style="s2"> they make chaos the image of their own ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.825" end="00:22:54.595" style="s2"> Maybe even a picture of their ideological obsession.</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:22:59.900" style="s2"> And here&#39;s what&#39;s happened lately:</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.940" end="00:23:03.215" style="s2"> some right-wingers,</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.215" end="00:23:06.800" style="s2"> the so-called &quot;alternative rights&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.865" end="00:23:09.285" style="s2"> enjoyed this effect as a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.285" end="00:23:12.095" style="s2"> against the &quot;warriors of social justice.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.175" end="00:23:15.535" style="s2"> Everything has gone so far,</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.535" end="00:23:18.345" style="s2"> that the BCC even designated Pepe</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.345" end="00:23:19.680" style="s2"> as a symbol of hatred.</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2"> And the Anti-Defamation League recognized him as a symbol of hatred.</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.085" end="00:23:26.525" style="s2"> Frog. Drawn frog.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.575" end="00:23:29.855" style="s2"> It was so ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.855" end="00:23:33.065" style="s2"> that the League later nevertheless withdrew some statements in this regard.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.135" end="00:23:35.345" style="s2"> It is clear that this whole event was politically motivated.</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.755" end="00:23:37.745" style="s2"> But how could such nonsense happen at all?</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.405" end="00:23:39.405" style="s2"> Well ...</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.625" end="00:23:43.975" style="s2"> Some of Pepe&#39;s images are some</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.975" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2"> of the thousands and thousands of these images,</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.695" end="00:23:49.575" style="s2"> have a racist theme.</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.155" end="00:23:53.925" style="s2"> There was Pepe-Hitler,</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.925" end="00:23:55.525" style="s2"> was Pepe of the Ku Klux Klan,</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.525" end="00:23:57.415" style="s2"> was Pepe- &quot;insidious Jew&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.420" end="00:24:00.900" style="s2"> was a Pepe-African American in the prism of racist stereotypes,</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.900" end="00:24:02.680" style="s2"> was Pepe-Mexican with all the clichés on the subject of Mexicans.</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.680" end="00:24:05.715" style="s2"> All these examples just sink</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.715" end="00:24:08.615" style="s2"> among the thousands and thousands of other Pepe images available online.</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.300" end="00:24:11.975" style="s2"> But when the &quot;warriors of social justice&quot; looked in the mirror,</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.980" end="00:24:15.500" style="s2"> in this pond images of Pepe,</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:18.675" style="s2"> all they could see</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.675" end="00:24:21.615" style="s2"> all that affected them was their own ideology.</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.085" end="00:24:23.745" style="s2"> Rather, the imprint of their ideology.</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.745" end="00:24:27.820" style="s2"> Changed. The dark shadow of their ideology.</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.065" end="00:24:32.545" style="s2"> Of course, the accusations flew instantly -</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.545" end="00:24:34.185" style="s2"> &quot;Pepe is a racist symbol!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.725" end="00:24:37.805" style="s2"> &quot;Pepe is a symbol of hatred!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.805" end="00:24:41.245" style="s2"> This is very ironic, because first of all no one has control over this character.</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.820" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2"> No one has any control over it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.380" end="00:24:48.980" style="s2"> Pepe is everything and everyone, and also nothing and none at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.260" end="00:24:53.500" style="s2"> And declaring it a symbol of hatred,</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.515" end="00:24:56.375" style="s2"> The BCC showed its own absurdity.</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.465" end="00:25:00.255" style="s2"> To the great delight of those who enjoyed this meme.</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.875" end="00:25:05.135" style="s2"> But there is an even greater irony hidden here.</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.425" end="00:25:10.375" style="s2"> If you look closely at what images they pulled,</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.375" end="00:25:12.500" style="s2"> calling them racist,</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.500" end="00:25:14.895" style="s2"> you will find a strange contradiction.</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.115" end="00:25:19.000" style="s2"> You see: on one side - Hitler-Pepe,</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.100" end="00:25:22.440" style="s2"> KKK-Pepe, Trump-Pepe.</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.820" end="00:25:26.900" style="s2"> On the other hand - &quot;insidious Jew&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.935" end="00:25:29.205" style="s2"> African American, Mexican.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.795" end="00:25:33.925" style="s2"> This means that Pepe at the same time -</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.925" end="00:25:36.800" style="s2"> archetypal oppressor,</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.845" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2"> which is considered by the victim,</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.635" end="00:25:42.800" style="s2"> and also the archetypal &quot;scapegoat,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.855" end="00:25:44.835" style="s2"> which is considered by the oppressor.</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.525" end="00:25:49.145" style="s2"> It turns out that Pepe is both sides of racism</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.145" end="00:25:50.660" style="s2"> at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.280" end="00:25:54.900" style="s2"> When the BCC looks at these images,</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.915" end="00:25:57.725" style="s2"> they automatically, without even thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.725" end="00:26:00.205" style="s2"> organize them to fit their ideology.</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.075" end="00:26:03.665" style="s2"> And this immediately exposes their program:</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.665" end="00:26:06.905" style="s2"> for they automatically decided that if Pepe was Hitler,</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.905" end="00:26:09.895" style="s2"> or the KKK, or Trump - Pepe is identified</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.895" end="00:26:11.555" style="s2"> with these people.</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.195" end="00:26:15.255" style="s2"> But if he is an &quot;insidious Jew,&quot; or an African-American, or a Mexican,</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.255" end="00:26:18.005" style="s2"> Pepe acts as a mockery of these people and criticizes them.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.795" end="00:26:21.925" style="s2"> Why such an absurd image of Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.925" end="00:26:25.245" style="s2"> as a painted frog - not a mockery of Hitler?</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.685" end="00:26:28.800" style="s2"> To tell the truth,</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.875" end="00:26:31.545" style="s2"> all that the BCC sees -</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.545" end="00:26:34.395" style="s2"> imprint of themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.395" end="00:26:35.975" style="s2"> Your dream, your shadow.</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.795" end="00:26:40.355" style="s2"> Quite a pathological urge,</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.355" end="00:26:43.355" style="s2"> which we have seen in the last few months -</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.355" end="00:26:46.500" style="s2"> to accuse everyone of commitment to Hitler, Nazism, white nationalism -</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.535" end="00:26:48.915" style="s2"> an expression of their hidden desire.</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.955" end="00:26:52.585" style="s2"> The desire to &quot;assert&quot; through the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.585" end="00:26:53.865" style="s2"> with his “other side”.</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.335" end="00:26:58.765" style="s2"> Funny, because the discourse of &quot;otherness&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.765" end="00:27:01.915" style="s2"> was the ideological weapon of the left</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.915" end="00:27:03.895" style="s2"> since the 1960s.</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.305" end="00:27:08.225" style="s2"> And now the time has come when</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.225" end="00:27:09.575" style="s2"> The &quot;others&quot; came to hunt for them.</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.395" end="00:27:14.145" style="s2"> Applying this strategy,</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.145" end="00:27:17.100" style="s2"> people who used Pepe&#39;s images,</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.115" end="00:27:20.065" style="s2"> gained an advantage due to the power of Chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.465" end="00:27:23.335" style="s2"> Gained an advantage where the frog jumps into the pond,</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.335" end="00:27:26.385" style="s2"> and descends to the very bottom,</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.385" end="00:27:28.555" style="s2"> to find the golden ball.</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.675" end="00:27:32.455" style="s2"> As I explained</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.460" end="00:27:35.940" style="s2"> during my conversation with Dr. Peterson, on the subject of the tale of the frog and the princess.</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.440" end="00:27:41.560" style="s2"> But a frog can’t be in the water all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.405" end="00:27:44.505" style="s2"> This is a very significant detail.</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.485" end="00:27:48.955" style="s2"> At some point you need to finish the tale.</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.020" end="00:27:54.660" style="s2"> To finish the tale, the frog needs to find a golden ball.</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.120" end="00:28:00.100" style="s2"> We can say that the golden ball is the Sun,</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.135" end="00:28:02.375" style="s2"> that will rise and begin a new day.</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.155" end="00:28:06.700" style="s2"> Frogs need to get a golden ball</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.755" end="00:28:09.575" style="s2"> and return it to the surface above the water.</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.495" end="00:28:13.655" style="s2"> She needs to carry the most significant thing,</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.655" end="00:28:16.685" style="s2"> carry over so she can see the world and the princess,</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.685" end="00:28:17.925" style="s2"> so she could grow.</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.295" end="00:28:21.000" style="s2"> If that doesn&#39;t happen,</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.045" end="00:28:23.845" style="s2"> it is not known what may come out of the water.</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.805" end="00:28:27.700" style="s2"> If the frog stays in the water too long,</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.755" end="00:28:30.795" style="s2"> she will be eaten, she will pull out</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.795" end="00:28:32.025" style="s2"> far more horrible monster.</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.935" end="00:28:35.815" style="s2"> Because out there in the water, there&#39;s a lot more,</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.815" end="00:28:36.815" style="s2"> in addition to the golden ball.</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.460" end="00:28:40.200" style="s2"> And the frog can make Leviathan devour her.</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.920" end="00:28:44.380" style="s2"> And it is quite possible.</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.745" end="00:28:48.535" style="s2"> While the frog swims in the dark,</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.535" end="00:28:52.100" style="s2"> BCC everyone is looking in the mirror,</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.195" end="00:28:54.215" style="s2"> calling his shadow.</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.515" end="00:28:59.155" style="s2"> We have already seen what it turns into</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.155" end="00:29:00.255" style="s2"> this is the game they play.</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.645" end="00:29:03.445" style="s2"> The frog can bring something other than the world of a new day.</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.285" end="00:29:05.785" style="s2"> It can cause the same monster</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.785" end="00:29:08.965" style="s2"> with which the BCC so want to overcome.</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.895" end="00:29:15.745" style="s2"> And so, the frog swims. How,</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.745" end="00:29:18.745" style="s2"> how she will do it, how to recognize her</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.745" end="00:29:21.235" style="s2"> the golden ball that lies at the bottom of the pond?</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.065" end="00:29:25.945" style="s2"> It is not easy to recognize that there is that,</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.945" end="00:29:27.195" style="s2"> when things are embraced by darkness.</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.085" end="00:29:32.100" style="s2"> But the tale already has</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.115" end="00:29:33.995" style="s2"> the answer to this question.</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.045" end="00:29:37.945" style="s2"> Frogs need to get out of the water</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.945" end="00:29:39.355" style="s2"> and become a prince.</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.045" end="00:29:42.925" style="s2"> Frogs need to change, to become something else.</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.905" end="00:29:46.475" style="s2"> And return to the surface of the golden ball -</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.475" end="00:29:49.515" style="s2"> it is the same as turning a frog into a prince.</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.265" end="00:29:52.425" style="s2"> One cannot happen without the other.</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.300" end="00:29:59.500" style="s2"> And, as Dr. Peterson suggested in his lectures,</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.540" end="00:30:03.740" style="s2"> the way to do it is to understand yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.625" end="00:30:07.005" style="s2"> Go down into the depths of yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.700" end="00:30:11.240" style="s2"> Find the golden ball that is hidden in the dark.</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2"> Go down and find</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:19.040" style="s2"> the most significant thing of Western civilization.</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2"> As suggested by Dr. Peterson,</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.700" end="00:30:29.640" style="s2"> the most significant thing of Western civilization is the Logos.</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.260" end="00:30:32.100" style="s2"> The truth that is the Word.</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.935" end="00:30:36.185" style="s2"> We saw Chaos roar, wanting to drown</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.185" end="00:30:38.315" style="s2"> in this noise Truth.</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.005" end="00:30:41.555" style="s2"> Peterson: What I&#39;m going to talk about is freedom of speech.</p>
