<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.920" style="s2">hi this is Bonnie and I&#39;m recording from</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.909" end="00:00:07.859" style="s2">the studio at although our insight</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.920" end="00:00:09.960" style="s2">center I just wanted to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.859" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">little sense of some of the difference</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.960" end="00:00:15.570" style="s2">that all the Laura can make and invite</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:19.080" style="s2">you to our eight week summer soul</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.570" end="00:00:22.970" style="s2">program through a series of short video</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.080" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">takes and today I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.970" end="00:00:28.199" style="s2">something that all the lore has</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:33.180" style="s2">developed over the years and that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.199" end="00:00:38.219" style="s2">this notion of working directly with</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.180" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">view and so one of the ways that I like</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:44.300" style="s2">to demonstrate that for people as I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:50.520" style="s2">this kind of reproduction of Cola means</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.300" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">model of the planetary system and as</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.520" end="00:00:57.180" style="s2">most of you probably know during total</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:01:02.190" style="s2">ptolemies time there was a very big</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.180" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">challenge and about explaining the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.190" end="00:01:08.909" style="s2">movements of the planets and it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">complicated by the fact that they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.909" end="00:01:14.460" style="s2">thinking of the earth as the center of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.549" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">planetary system and then they had these</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">complex orbits of the planets to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">describe the way the planets moved in</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">the night sky and to make matters more</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">complicated they had to have a model</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">that explained the apparent retrograde</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:36.810" style="s2">or backwards movements of the planets</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">with respect to the earth and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.810" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">observations that they were making so</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">Ptolemy came up with a model of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">orbits which are very quite complex and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:51.649" style="s2">this notion of epicycles which he</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">envisioned each of the planets that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.649" end="00:01:59.909" style="s2">distributed retrograde would go around</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.280" end="00:02:04.110" style="s2">in their orbit but also have these at</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.909" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">periodic epicycles so that they would</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.110" end="00:02:09.789" style="s2">apparently move backwards in the night</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:12.099" style="s2">sky and so we all know today that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.789" end="00:02:15.189" style="s2">Turkish comes and he says well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.099" end="00:02:17.590" style="s2">all very good it certainly explains</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.189" end="00:02:23.140" style="s2">retrograde but it&#39;s much too complex if</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.590" end="00:02:26.439" style="s2">we think of the orbital system revolving</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.140" end="00:02:30.250" style="s2">around the Sun then we have a much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.439" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">elegant model and so now not only is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.250" end="00:02:34.569" style="s2">model more elegant but it has the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:38.489" style="s2">capacity to explain everything that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.569" end="00:02:43.629" style="s2">Ptolemy explained and much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.489" end="00:02:46.780" style="s2">explanatory power so this is what we use</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.629" end="00:02:50.319" style="s2">as an analogy to talk about the shift in</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.780" end="00:02:54.189" style="s2">view the view from an earth centric</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.319" end="00:02:57.129" style="s2">planetary system to a heliocentric solar</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.189" end="00:02:59.819" style="s2">system makes a huge difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.129" end="00:03:05.319" style="s2">history of science in our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.819" end="00:03:09.790" style="s2">so we take this as an analogy and we use</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.319" end="00:03:14.650" style="s2">it to develop insight training in people</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.790" end="00:03:19.419" style="s2">and what we use it for as an analogy is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.650" end="00:03:22.629" style="s2">we talk about that we are all inside our</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.419" end="00:03:24.970" style="s2">own complex lives and especially young</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.629" end="00:03:27.299" style="s2">people today are facing a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.970" end="00:03:31.769" style="s2">future a lot of radical change</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.299" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">acceleration of the institutionalization</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.769" end="00:03:38.709" style="s2">decentralization the deconstruction of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:42.540" style="s2">all the knowledge systems so this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.709" end="00:03:45.879" style="s2">very complex and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.540" end="00:03:48.549" style="s2">suggestions and opinions out there that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.879" end="00:03:49.900" style="s2">for me I like ptolemies approach just</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.549" end="00:03:53.859" style="s2">making everything more and more more</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.900" end="00:03:56.260" style="s2">complex and so at all the Laura we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.859" end="00:03:58.209" style="s2">developed principles and practices so</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.260" end="00:04:01.720" style="s2">when we have situations that are complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.209" end="00:04:07.060" style="s2">that way we learn to situate ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.720" end="00:04:10.269" style="s2">inside our view to identify we call it</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.060" end="00:04:14.199" style="s2">constellated just like the solar system</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.269" end="00:04:16.570" style="s2">constantly all the nodes all the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.199" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">features that are making the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.570" end="00:04:21.669" style="s2">and be able to identify where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">sitting where we&#39;re looking from and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.669" end="00:04:25.180" style="s2">work directly with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:29.050" style="s2">that&#39;s called our view to work directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.180" end="00:04:33.430" style="s2">with our view and then shift that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.050" end="00:04:36.900" style="s2">once the that view shifts just like from</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.430" end="00:04:39.400" style="s2">Ptolemies earth centric to Copernicus</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.900" end="00:04:41.800" style="s2">heliocentric view once the shift when</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.400" end="00:04:44.290" style="s2">where you at once a view from where</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.800" end="00:04:46.930" style="s2">you&#39;re at shifts then the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.290" end="00:04:50.260" style="s2">constellation falls into place and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.930" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">can see clearly where you need to be you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.260" end="00:04:57.370" style="s2">can see clearly what the next steps are</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:05:00.820" style="s2">you can see clearly there&#39;s a clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.370" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">purpose and alignment with passion your</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.820" end="00:05:06.430" style="s2">energies aligned and the future really</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:09.970" style="s2">starts to come into shape in a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.430" end="00:05:13.210" style="s2">concrete way so but for our summer</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.970" end="00:05:16.660" style="s2">program this summer at the eight-week</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.210" end="00:05:23.169" style="s2">program this is the core feature of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.660" end="00:05:25.479" style="s2">practice is to take what you bring to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.169" end="00:05:27.940" style="s2">the conversation what&#39;s important to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.479" end="00:05:31.570" style="s2">what are your critical and significant</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.940" end="00:05:36.700" style="s2">questions and collectively work that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.570" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">into this practice of working directly</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.700" end="00:05:42.099" style="s2">with the view that you&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:45.490" style="s2">holding all the complexity of that view</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.099" end="00:05:47.220" style="s2">and shift it into something that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.490" end="00:05:49.770" style="s2">more elegant and beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.220" end="00:05:52.150" style="s2">manageable and work or keable and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.770" end="00:05:54.070" style="s2">inspirational to get that insight to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.150" end="00:05:55.539" style="s2">shift your view so that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.070" end="00:05:58.660" style="s2">difference that all the Lord insight</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.539" end="00:06:00.280" style="s2">Center can make in your life it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.660" end="00:06:02.139" style="s2">practice we&#39;ve been developing with</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.280" end="00:06:05.380" style="s2">groups and individuals and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.139" end="00:06:08.070" style="s2">very powerful so I hope to see you here</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.380" end="00:06:08.070" style="s2">this summer</p>
