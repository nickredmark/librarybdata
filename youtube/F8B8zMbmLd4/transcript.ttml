<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:24.740" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.960" end="00:00:27.619" style="s2">okay once again welcome to the stoah a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.740" end="00:00:34.449" style="s2">place for dialogue around what matters</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.619" end="00:00:34.449" style="s2">most at the knife edge of history so</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.110" end="00:00:46.460" style="s2">what I thought maybe we could do spend</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.559" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">10 minutes if you are holding some</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.460" end="00:00:54.530" style="s2">insight are some powerful meaning you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.960" end="00:00:58.809" style="s2">been making about the trust exercise or</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.530" end="00:01:03.320" style="s2">a question or just something that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.809" end="00:01:06.290" style="s2">yeah that kind of surprised you so just</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.320" end="00:01:10.880" style="s2">let&#39;s just go to the quarter hour and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.290" end="00:01:14.570" style="s2">see if we can share some of that some</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.880" end="00:01:19.220" style="s2">some of what you expected or didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.570" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">expect or surprised by that exercise and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.220" end="00:01:24.220" style="s2">I have you all muted so you can just</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">unmute yourself to share</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.220" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.690" end="00:01:37.770" style="s2">and I have no idea how relevant this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:39.330" style="s2">Bernice you asked at one point whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.770" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2">there was anyone that you would believe</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.330" end="00:01:42.690" style="s2">them even if you couldn&#39;t see it for</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.060" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.690" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">right and I put my hand up immediately</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">to that because as there is there is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:50.550" style="s2">person in my life who I absolutely would</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">and yet that same person was not one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.550" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">the first people that came to mind when</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:54.990" style="s2">I first started doing the exercise so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:56.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that means anything but</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.990" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">that was something that struck me as odd</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.730" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">at the time yeah you know this is this</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:03.690" style="s2">is fun we don&#39;t have to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:06.890" style="s2">everything but that&#39;s interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.690" end="00:02:06.890" style="s2">an interesting data point</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.560" end="00:02:23.310" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s when you talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">were looking at people&#39;s what people</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.310" end="00:02:32.990" style="s2">were saying I&#39;m Bonita and you said</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">something about how if we have few</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.990" end="00:02:38.100" style="s2">people we can trust in that center</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:42.120" style="s2">circle as compared to the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.100" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">outer circle that that system is fragile</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.120" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">and yeah I&#39;ve been I&#39;m in feeling really</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:57.239" style="s2">connected to that and looking at my you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">know I often will go oh I have to reach</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.239" end="00:03:04.350" style="s2">out to these bigger sis you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:07.170" style="s2">then I&#39;m like I don&#39;t see what I could</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.350" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">be nurturing close to me and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.170" end="00:03:17.670" style="s2">there&#39;s patterns that have instantiated</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:23.940" style="s2">that needs to be important or all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.670" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">of yeah interesting stuff there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.940" end="00:03:28.860" style="s2">this is a this is a kind of predicament</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:33.600" style="s2">we&#39;re in because we&#39;re introduced to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.860" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">lot of people we don&#39;t know by artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.600" end="00:03:39.739" style="s2">of their highest self like a novel they</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:44.540" style="s2">wrote or a piece of academic writing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.739" end="00:03:47.069" style="s2">these make them highly desirable trust</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.540" end="00:03:50.830" style="s2"> points for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.069" end="00:03:54.790" style="s2">and then the people next to us we see</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.830" end="00:03:56.740" style="s2">them in all their glory and that is both</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.790" end="00:03:59.260" style="s2">a challenge but as someone said last</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.740" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">time it&#39;s it&#39;s signals if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.260" end="00:04:09.100" style="s2">figure it out it signals an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">to deepen trust and we tend to look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.100" end="00:04:13.540" style="s2">quantity so if we&#39;re in business for</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:16.810" style="s2">example a lot of us are independent</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.540" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">contractors we used to having a large</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.810" end="00:04:26.650" style="s2">rolodex and I think focusing on building</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:29.910" style="s2">was a very small very strong small world</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.650" end="00:04:32.530" style="s2">network and you can look up some cold</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.910" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">Interactive&#39;s on small world networks</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.530" end="00:04:39.370" style="s2">and why they scale better than these</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">kind of flat either hub-and-spoke or</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.370" end="00:04:47.639" style="s2">these flat kind of cross connections so</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:50.950" style="s2">so that&#39;s just something to think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.639" end="00:04:55.720" style="s2">again I always want to remind myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.950" end="00:04:56.830" style="s2">that these are just variations as I said</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.720" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">when I first started doing this about</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.830" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">seven years ago I really thought I had a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:04.600" style="s2">handle on what trust in the human system</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:07.960" style="s2">was and it turns out there&#39;s many many</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.600" end="00:05:10.900" style="s2">variations so it&#39;s always about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.960" end="00:05:17.770" style="s2">what feels right and speaks to you but</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.900" end="00:05:21.310" style="s2">no that&#39;s a good noticing neither can I</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.770" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">jump in on that yes please mate what you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.310" end="00:05:26.260" style="s2">were just saying about many different</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">kinds of trust I&#39;ve been noticing for</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.260" end="00:05:33.190" style="s2">the last I think since the last session</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:34.600" style="s2">about we talked about that all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.190" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">different ways that we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.600" end="00:05:44.560" style="s2">trust people because we get to trust in</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:49.150" style="s2">in more abstraction like law or you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.560" end="00:05:50.770" style="s2">other institutions and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.150" end="00:05:55.690" style="s2">noticing well I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:58.120" style="s2">what would my life be like if I trusted</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.690" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">if I could find ways to engender more</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.120" end="00:06:05.289" style="s2">trust in the people that I&#39;m close with</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:08.379" style="s2">and also noticing how in the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.289" end="00:06:10.990" style="s2">having to trust people for like food</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.379" end="00:06:14.740" style="s2">survival protection things like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.990" end="00:06:18.969" style="s2">I sort of default two ways of trust that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.740" end="00:06:20.889" style="s2">feel really natural to me and that makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.969" end="00:06:23.169" style="s2">me like select a certain kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.889" end="00:06:24.879" style="s2">that I trust like it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.169" end="00:06:27.069" style="s2">reasons that I&#39;m here listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.879" end="00:06:28.840" style="s2">talk and spending time at the stores</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.069" end="00:06:31.960" style="s2">because I trust people who can express</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.840" end="00:06:33.639" style="s2">themselves in certain ways and see order</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.960" end="00:06:36.279" style="s2">and patterns in certain ways and can</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.639" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">talk about that but that means that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.279" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">sort of default to trusting a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:46.029" style="s2">kind of I don&#39;t know just way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:47.770" style="s2">expressing themselves I select that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.029" end="00:06:50.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about how I could</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.770" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">find more ways to trust people more</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.529" end="00:06:55.180" style="s2">broadly and to trust people who make</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:59.379" style="s2">sense in different ways than I do just</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.180" end="00:07:01.900" style="s2">to experiment with that I guess yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.379" end="00:07:03.819" style="s2">think the point is that all of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.900" end="00:07:06.279" style="s2">interested in moving to a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.819" end="00:07:11.319" style="s2">of society let&#39;s say distributed economy</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.279" end="00:07:14.319" style="s2">or gain B ish type thing this puts us</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.319" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">right in front of one place where the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.319" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">work needs to be done just to examine</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:23.379" style="s2">this on a more phenomenological level</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:24.810" style="s2">you know what is it to trust and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.379" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">are the different types of trust and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.810" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">what kinds of trust networks do we need</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">to pull off this the the future of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:39.069" style="s2">society we see and there&#39;s a lot of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:42.370" style="s2">know we take it for granted that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.069" end="00:07:43.779" style="s2">trust people who drive for example you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.370" end="00:07:47.110" style="s2">know they&#39;re not going to run red lights</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.779" end="00:07:49.689" style="s2">and stuff like that but we begin to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.110" end="00:07:52.659" style="s2">think that people the road is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.689" end="00:07:57.879" style="s2">trustworthy because we have rules and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.659" end="00:08:00.909" style="s2">laws and stoplights when in fact what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.879" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">really cool is when the power goes down</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.909" end="00:08:07.629" style="s2">you see people they are an expression of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:09.940" style="s2">the kinds of social dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.629" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">behaviors that we are as humans</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.940" end="00:08:14.260" style="s2">pro-social dynamics and so you see those</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:17.380" style="s2">crazy videos</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.260" end="00:08:19.750" style="s2">traffic and Indonesia or India where</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.380" end="00:08:21.610" style="s2">there is like all this stuff and people</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.750" end="00:08:24.820" style="s2">are driving really fast but they have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.610" end="00:08:29.290" style="s2">way that you know they know how to flow</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.820" end="00:08:32.830" style="s2">so we don&#39;t want to go too far into</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.290" end="00:08:35.740" style="s2">thinking that people don&#39;t kill each</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.830" end="00:08:40.360" style="s2">other because the law you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.740" end="00:08:44.140" style="s2">because it&#39;s illegal and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.360" end="00:08:46.960" style="s2">in which there are certain incentives</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.140" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">for people in power we&#39;ve been talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.960" end="00:08:50.940" style="s2">about power today for us to think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:54.910" style="s2">that&#39;s why we don&#39;t kill each other or</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.940" end="00:08:58.150" style="s2">that&#39;s why things work in fact in times</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.910" end="00:09:01.390" style="s2">of crises like this little one we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.150" end="00:09:04.890" style="s2">going through it&#39;s the opposite the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.390" end="00:09:12.010" style="s2">large system has to decompose into these</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.890" end="00:09:13.270" style="s2">person-to-person type dynamics so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.010" end="00:09:15.490" style="s2">we could talk about that another day but</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.270" end="00:09:25.570" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a really good noticing</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.490" end="00:09:37.630" style="s2">anything else did anyone think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.570" end="00:09:39.850" style="s2">trusting nature this is another place</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.630" end="00:09:44.110" style="s2">that we need to examine ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.850" end="00:09:47.230" style="s2">there&#39;s this person last name Chandler</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.110" end="00:09:49.210" style="s2">wrote on toe politics in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.230" end="00:09:50.440" style="s2">Anthropocene it&#39;s a horrible title</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.210" end="00:09:52.840" style="s2">because the book is much better than</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.440" end="00:09:55.150" style="s2">that we talked about him the first day</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.840" end="00:10:01.000" style="s2">because he talks about hacking tracking</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.150" end="00:10:04.780" style="s2">and mapping but he notes that we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.000" end="00:10:10.060" style="s2">have as late modernists even post miners</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.780" end="00:10:12.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve tend to frame nature as predatory</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.060" end="00:10:14.650" style="s2">so the Darwinian attitude like if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.760" end="00:10:18.510" style="s2">weren&#39;t pushing back on nature all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.650" end="00:10:25.740" style="s2">time it would kill us or something and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.510" end="00:10:27.660" style="s2">there&#39;s this book called I&#39;m so bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.740" end="00:10:30.630" style="s2">something about killed</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.660" end="00:10:32.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t nest isset e or something any</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.630" end="00:10:34.770" style="s2">and there&#39;s some research on foraging</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.820" end="00:10:36.960" style="s2">societies and you know they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.770" end="00:10:38.370" style="s2">half-naked people that live in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.960" end="00:10:40.050" style="s2">jungle and he&#39;s like they&#39;re not afraid</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.370" end="00:10:42.030" style="s2">they&#39;re not afraid that they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.050" end="00:10:44.850" style="s2">eat in every single day you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.030" end="00:10:47.700" style="s2">not huddled around their campfire</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.850" end="00:10:49.710" style="s2">waiting for like a monster to come</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.700" end="00:10:51.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what modern people do we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.710" end="00:10:55.020" style="s2">huddled at home waiting for the virus to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.660" end="00:10:57.870" style="s2">come and it&#39;s really you start to really</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.020" end="00:11:00.420" style="s2">examine some of these assumptions about</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.870" end="00:11:02.990" style="s2">who we are as a people and what we trust</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.420" end="00:11:07.740" style="s2">and what we what we do not trust and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.990" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s a whole nother place to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.740" end="00:11:14.250" style="s2">go with the trust exercise civilize to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:19.770" style="s2">death yes that&#39;s the book thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.250" end="00:11:22.350" style="s2">much yeah when I read that and I could</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.770" end="00:11:28.680" style="s2">see it that I imagined you probably can</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.350" end="00:11:31.620" style="s2">hear my dogs sorry that yeah I imagined</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.680" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">that was the case and actually when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.620" end="00:11:37.500" style="s2">look at that first impulse to huddle and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:42.030" style="s2">be really afraid this is in the medieval</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.500" end="00:11:45.390" style="s2">religions so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a famous</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.030" end="00:11:47.730" style="s2">Cathedral in intron time that if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.390" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">walk through you can just see how this</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.730" end="00:11:52.920" style="s2">religion came from people feeling very</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">very insecure about their place in life</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.920" end="00:12:00.750" style="s2">so that&#39;s another that&#39;s another way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:04.860" style="s2">weave in your trust network to trust</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.750" end="00:12:10.850" style="s2">that the earth can produce food and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.860" end="00:12:10.850" style="s2">you know the hydrological cycles can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.240" end="00:12:19.350" style="s2">be resilient and stuff like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.290" end="00:12:23.910" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.350" end="00:12:26.490" style="s2">follow-up thing to think about anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.910" end="00:12:30.420" style="s2">can I just make a just Express something</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.490" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">that I&#39;m thinking there um these this</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.420" end="00:12:35.340" style="s2">idea that you know don&#39;t worry you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:38.340" style="s2">trust nature because it provides x y&amp;z</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.340" end="00:12:40.889" style="s2">to me that you can trust that trust</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.340" end="00:12:43.619" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily a always good</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.889" end="00:12:47.759" style="s2">they trust being a function of capacity</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.619" end="00:12:51.480" style="s2">reliability and stuff so I can trust a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.759" end="00:12:54.059" style="s2">bad actor to always be bad in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.480" end="00:12:56.369" style="s2">way so it&#39;s I just don&#39;t want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.059" end="00:12:58.799" style="s2">that people have to find the good in</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.369" end="00:13:02.939" style="s2">everything they trust I still think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.799" end="00:13:05.549" style="s2">very not only useful but well Lucille</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.939" end="00:13:06.869" style="s2">informative to actually trust in both</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.549" end="00:13:08.939" style="s2">sides of things and the good bad and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.869" end="00:13:10.379" style="s2">indifferent I know I just opted off</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.939" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2">there as you were mentioning it yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.379" end="00:13:14.730" style="s2">this is excellent and maybe we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:16.109" style="s2">have to we map it strongly on to power</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.730" end="00:13:20.220" style="s2">but it has something to do with power</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.109" end="00:13:22.410" style="s2">you know and like in organizations when</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.220" end="00:13:24.059" style="s2">people complain about their supervisor</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.410" end="00:13:26.459" style="s2">or their boss and they&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.059" end="00:13:29.669" style="s2">whatever we do he&#39;s going to be against</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.459" end="00:13:32.549" style="s2">it or she&#39;s going to be against it trust</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.669" end="00:13:36.569" style="s2">a thief to steal exactly but what I say</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.549" end="00:13:38.040" style="s2">is that&#39;s no problem because you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.569" end="00:13:40.470" style="s2">trust you know you can just</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.040" end="00:13:42.209" style="s2">operationalize that it&#39;s predictable it</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.470" end="00:13:44.579" style="s2">actually reduces some of the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.209" end="00:13:46.829" style="s2">the worst supervisors are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.579" end="00:13:49.919" style="s2">are just like the worst parents they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.829" end="00:13:53.069" style="s2">so disconnected it&#39;s this one day and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.919" end="00:13:55.499" style="s2">that you know they&#39;re there and and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.069" end="00:13:59.089" style="s2">can create you know that can really</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.499" end="00:14:02.009" style="s2">drive you crazy but yeah you can trust</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.089" end="00:14:04.199" style="s2">the law one of the reasons why nature is</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.009" end="00:14:06.119" style="s2">trustworthy is because many of the laws</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.199" end="00:14:11.610" style="s2">of nature are quite predictable not all</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.119" end="00:14:13.169" style="s2">of them but you can trust that certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.610" end="00:14:14.669" style="s2">very large animals are going to behave</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.169" end="00:14:17.480" style="s2">in some ways and not other than others</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.669" end="00:14:20.790" style="s2">and things like this and so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.480" end="00:14:24.239" style="s2">even that is cool to try to on is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.790" end="00:14:27.539" style="s2">honor that aspect of nature and one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.239" end="00:14:29.999" style="s2">the things that I teach in my course is</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.539" end="00:14:31.829" style="s2">whenever you know eventually the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.999" end="00:14:34.739" style="s2">question of free will comes up in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.829" end="00:14:38.600" style="s2">course and it&#39;s a really big rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.739" end="00:14:44.569" style="s2">and I use a metaphor based on process</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.600" end="00:14:47.839" style="s2">philosophy and that is that agency is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.569" end="00:14:52.289" style="s2">participation of promise and possibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:54.960" style="s2">so I say if the rock did not promise to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.289" end="00:14:58.050" style="s2">lie upon the earth I could</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.960" end="00:15:00.750" style="s2">pick her up and throw it so the laws</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.050" end="00:15:03.140" style="s2">which seems like determinism that put</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.750" end="00:15:06.570" style="s2">hold the rock and gravity together</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.140" end="00:15:08.910" style="s2">actually create a kind of agency and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.570" end="00:15:10.890" style="s2">those of you that saw Dave Snowden</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.910" end="00:15:14.130" style="s2">yesterday he would say it&#39;s an enabling</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.890" end="00:15:18.149" style="s2">constraint so if you could and you start</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.130" end="00:15:21.510" style="s2">to see you start to see a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.149" end="00:15:24.330" style="s2">turned around so for example we think of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.510" end="00:15:26.910" style="s2">gravity as the limiting condition for</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.330" end="00:15:30.570" style="s2">flight but actually without gravity</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.910" end="00:15:32.040" style="s2">flight itself would not be possible so</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.570" end="00:15:36.270" style="s2">you start to see there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.040" end="00:15:38.550" style="s2">partnership between predictability which</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.270" end="00:15:41.940" style="s2">is a enabling constraint for other</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.550" end="00:15:44.580" style="s2">possibilities and that predictability is</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.940" end="00:15:49.070" style="s2">where that trust comes in that some of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.580" end="00:15:53.190" style="s2">some of our that you&#39;re speaking to so</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.070" end="00:15:57.140" style="s2">yeah cool</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.190" end="00:16:00.570" style="s2">all righty excellent</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.140" end="00:16:02.700" style="s2">so he&#39;s encouraging when there&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.570" end="00:16:03.750" style="s2">going forward into the to the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.700" end="00:16:09.870" style="s2">session okay today I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.750" end="00:16:13.500" style="s2">about power and I let&#39;s just get some</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.870" end="00:16:16.880" style="s2">ideas is that horribly disturbing this</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.500" end="00:16:22.650" style="s2">is just okay it&#39;s okay okay it&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:25.589" style="s2">let&#39;s get some ideas of how power</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.650" end="00:16:27.990" style="s2">manifests in your life is it like do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.589" end="00:16:32.400" style="s2">think about it pal oh the dogs are fun</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.990" end="00:16:34.110" style="s2">power like power let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.400" end="00:16:35.610" style="s2">something about power what are do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.110" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">feel empowered do you feel disempowered</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.610" end="00:16:41.690" style="s2">do you feel like you have a lot of power</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:46.650" style="s2">now you postmodern about power is power</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.690" end="00:16:54.690" style="s2">patriarchal what&#39;s on what&#39;s what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.650" end="00:16:58.709" style="s2">our consciousness about power well I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.690" end="00:17:03.270" style="s2">feel like power is sometimes very</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.709" end="00:17:06.059" style="s2">counterintuitive that&#39;s like when I feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.270" end="00:17:08.820" style="s2">myself most wanting to control things</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.059" end="00:17:12.900" style="s2">and like get a grip on the situation</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.820" end="00:17:14.970" style="s2">I feel most empowered poo and I I guess</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.900" end="00:17:20.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a way that it&#39;s related to trust</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.970" end="00:17:22.350" style="s2">and I trust in like the process or that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.070" end="00:17:25.880" style="s2">everything will unfold the way it should</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.350" end="00:17:34.050" style="s2">I feel more empowered so that&#39;s my what</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.880" end="00:17:35.820" style="s2">I quite like the framing they give to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.050" end="00:17:37.950" style="s2">power in the Game of Thrones right where</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.820" end="00:17:39.690" style="s2">power is where people believe it is air</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.950" end="00:17:47.040" style="s2">power power is where people look for it</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.690" end="00:17:51.230" style="s2">I met them and si Academy and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.040" end="00:17:54.570" style="s2">they define power as the ability to hold</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.230" end="00:18:06.750" style="s2">your own perspective and then also get</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.570" end="00:18:10.800" style="s2">other people to do what you want the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.750" end="00:18:12.410" style="s2">liminal space agency talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.800" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">there&#39;s different kinds of power</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.410" end="00:18:21.900" style="s2">concepts of power it&#39;s sort of course of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:27.150" style="s2">power to make things happen make people</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.900" end="00:18:30.630" style="s2">do things and then then just going up a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.150" end="00:18:35.340" style="s2">level to this power being the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.630" end="00:18:40.190" style="s2">to influence what&#39;s happening yes so</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.340" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">there&#39;s coercive coordinated cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.190" end="00:18:55.260" style="s2">collaborative and co-creative look we</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:59.670" style="s2">might get to that that series anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.260" end="00:19:01.740" style="s2">else you know was I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.670" end="00:19:03.570" style="s2">thing that popped in my head was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.740" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">word alignment it&#39;s being in alignment</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.570" end="00:19:13.320" style="s2">with something and also fully embodying</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.440" end="00:19:17.580" style="s2">that that you&#39;re aligned with okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.320" end="00:19:21.860" style="s2">has something to do with agency there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.580" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinction between doing what</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.860" end="00:19:26.880" style="s2">what you have to do for others like men</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:28.920" style="s2">are often powerful because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.880" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to satisfy other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.920" end="00:19:33.750" style="s2">needs rather than their own internal</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:38.430" style="s2">needs this could be true for anybody but</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.750" end="00:19:40.200" style="s2">power coming from the ability to yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.430" end="00:19:42.180" style="s2">that satisfying meet your own goals</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.200" end="00:19:44.460" style="s2">rather than somebody else&#39;s even though</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.180" end="00:19:48.270" style="s2">that looks powerful yeah intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.460" end="00:19:50.850" style="s2">versus extrinsic power self authored</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.270" end="00:19:52.920" style="s2">power versus reactive power there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.850" end="00:19:55.260" style="s2">different way to say is a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.920" end="00:19:57.770" style="s2">thing but similar and then money as</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.260" end="00:20:03.240" style="s2">power come up through the chat room here</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.770" end="00:20:07.970" style="s2">okay anything else my experience power</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.240" end="00:20:15.810" style="s2">as the ability to be with whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.970" end="00:20:21.060" style="s2">remain and not disappear and remain yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.810" end="00:20:24.510" style="s2">how do we experience power I think of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.060" end="00:20:27.180" style="s2">as opportunity to impact things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.510" end="00:20:32.370" style="s2">have a will of their own and that could</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.180" end="00:20:37.740" style="s2">be system another person even parts of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.370" end="00:20:39.330" style="s2">your own psyche ah yeah okay so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.740" end="00:20:45.150" style="s2">getting really close so I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.330" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">write something down and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.150" end="00:20:53.940" style="s2">the source code formula for power one we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:21:00.600" style="s2">could see if it&#39;s powerful or if it has</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.940" end="00:21:03.000" style="s2">some limitations power equals well power</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.600" end="00:21:07.410" style="s2">first the definition of power I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.000" end="00:21:08.200" style="s2">to work with is the flow of force so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.410" end="00:21:11.139" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.200" end="00:21:13.059" style="s2">action powers always relative to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.139" end="00:21:17.080" style="s2">movement in a certain direction and some</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.059" end="00:21:20.679" style="s2">of you talked about that and again this</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.080" end="00:21:24.190" style="s2">could be internally psychological so if</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.679" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">I&#39;m reactive than the flow of forces</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.190" end="00:21:31.659" style="s2">from my unconscious drives to my</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:35.740" style="s2">behaviors right so power is not a static</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.659" end="00:21:38.409" style="s2">thing it&#39;s related to a flow of force</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.740" end="00:21:43.840" style="s2">and and we&#39;re interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.409" end="00:21:47.010" style="s2">direction that flow is power can only be</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.840" end="00:21:50.139" style="s2">experienced if it flows from more power</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.010" end="00:21:57.490" style="s2">to less power or else there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.139" end="00:22:02.970" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t use the term power and now I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.490" end="00:22:08.070" style="s2">want you to write power equals skills</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.970" end="00:22:08.070" style="s2">and resources</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.869" end="00:22:32.980" style="s2">/ needs and wants okay so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.739" end="00:22:36.669" style="s2">standing in a path in the woods and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.980" end="00:22:41.619" style="s2">bear comes toward me then I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.669" end="00:22:47.999" style="s2">experience a power gradient based upon</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.619" end="00:22:50.619" style="s2">my skills and resources / - and montz</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.999" end="00:22:56.399" style="s2">relative to the bear&#39;s skills and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.619" end="00:22:59.889" style="s2">resources divided by its needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.399" end="00:23:02.259" style="s2">so if I have a gun in my hand right</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.889" end="00:23:06.369" style="s2">that&#39;s a resource and I know how to use</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.259" end="00:23:09.940" style="s2">it then I might feel powerful relative</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.369" end="00:23:13.989" style="s2">to a bear who&#39;s equally startled as I am</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.940" end="00:23:17.799" style="s2">and just wants to walk off into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.989" end="00:23:23.830" style="s2">wilderness despite his larger power full</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.799" end="00:23:26.859" style="s2">body but if I don&#39;t have the skills the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.830" end="00:23:30.909" style="s2">resource of a gun or the skills to run</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.859" end="00:23:34.090" style="s2">faster than the bear and the bear has</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.909" end="00:23:36.879" style="s2">the big powerful body and wants to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.090" end="00:23:39.970" style="s2">protect her cub from me then we have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.879" end="00:23:42.030" style="s2">different power equation</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.970" end="00:23:42.030" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:48.110" style="s2">now the difference between skills and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.170" end="00:23:50.750" style="s2">resources needs and wants our skills and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.110" end="00:23:55.460" style="s2">needs are used up all the time you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.750" end="00:23:57.320" style="s2">employ your skills to solve you employ</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.460" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">your skills and these are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.320" end="00:24:02.450" style="s2">arising I need to pee I need to eat I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:05.660" style="s2">need this where as resources and wants</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.450" end="00:24:08.600" style="s2">are aggregated like I have money in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.660" end="00:24:13.870" style="s2">bank there&#39;s I have I have lots of guns</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.600" end="00:24:17.930" style="s2">or someday I want to have a new house so</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.870" end="00:24:21.560" style="s2">resources are skills applied that build</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.930" end="00:24:27.350" style="s2">up by applying skill over time and wants</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.560" end="00:24:30.160" style="s2">our needs that are scale over time does</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.350" end="00:24:30.160" style="s2">that make sense okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.980" end="00:24:38.270" style="s2">so when you think of now now this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.450" end="00:24:40.820" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about this is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.270" end="00:24:46.870" style="s2">explains a lot of the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.820" end="00:24:50.420" style="s2">power if I am a young college student</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.870" end="00:24:53.560" style="s2">female heterosexual and I walk into the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.420" end="00:24:58.310" style="s2">pub and there&#39;s a great big looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.560" end="00:25:01.370" style="s2">really attractive guy is kind of like on</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.310" end="00:25:05.300" style="s2">his game I may feel transgressed upon</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.370" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">just because maybe I need him to like</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.300" end="00:25:11.450" style="s2">acknowledge me or he&#39;s just just because</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:12.380" style="s2">he&#39;s got more skills and resources less</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.450" end="00:25:14.450" style="s2">needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.380" end="00:25:16.460" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t care anything about me but</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.450" end="00:25:19.070" style="s2">I&#39;m psychologically emotionally and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.460" end="00:25:23.330" style="s2">maybe even sexually moved he is moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.070" end="00:25:28.250" style="s2">me right so power is who gets to move</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.330" end="00:25:32.210" style="s2">who and so just by a certain presence</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.250" end="00:25:34.100" style="s2">a person can psychologically move</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.210" end="00:25:36.350" style="s2">another person and you will feel that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.100" end="00:25:40.070" style="s2">they&#39;re exercising power whether they</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.350" end="00:25:43.580" style="s2">are thinking about it or not because</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.070" end="00:25:47.210" style="s2">you&#39;re moved by someone else who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.580" end="00:25:49.970" style="s2">moving you this is always this is often</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.210" end="00:25:52.730" style="s2">a big insight for not only women but for</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.970" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">men who you know don&#39;t understand why</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.730" end="00:25:57.179" style="s2">the world reacts to them the way they do</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:59.100" style="s2">because it just exude power and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.179" end="00:26:03.330" style="s2">good thing but they don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.100" end="00:26:06.860" style="s2">that it will force will flow based upon</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.330" end="00:26:06.860" style="s2">this power formula</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:16.770" style="s2">this is also the shadow and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.470" end="00:26:20.100" style="s2">relationships with funders very hard for</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.770" end="00:26:21.660" style="s2">them to become your peer because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.100" end="00:26:24.660" style="s2">always they have more resources and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.660" end="00:26:28.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s always a power flow there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.660" end="00:26:32.460" style="s2">always the felt sense of power the flow</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.560" end="00:26:34.710" style="s2">of force that is is pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.460" end="00:26:36.770" style="s2">inescapable</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.710" end="00:26:36.770" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.850" end="00:26:43.790" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:50.450" style="s2">now as this formula works of course many</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.790" end="00:26:54.110" style="s2">of us when we feel disempowered we work</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.450" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">really hard at improving skills and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.110" end="00:27:02.570" style="s2">building resources but in our world</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:04.460" style="s2">today it is often the case that our</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.570" end="00:27:06.950" style="s2">needs and wants grow faster than that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.460" end="00:27:10.580" style="s2">and this is underlooked</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.950" end="00:27:13.660" style="s2">this is underlooked the the exponential</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.580" end="00:27:17.060" style="s2">growth of our needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.660" end="00:27:23.180" style="s2">continually disempowers us and then we</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.060" end="00:27:26.540" style="s2">project that onto an aggressor so when I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.180" end="00:27:28.430" style="s2">saw occupy kids the Occupy movement give</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.540" end="00:27:30.980" style="s2">us free this give us free that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.430" end="00:27:32.870" style="s2">completely disempowering and anyone with</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.980" end="00:27:35.860" style="s2">power just knows it just feels it</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.870" end="00:27:35.860" style="s2">they&#39;re completely disempowered</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.950" end="00:27:42.010" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:56.210" style="s2">so one of the greatest ways to work with</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.210" end="00:27:58.429" style="s2">power if you feel disempowered or you</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.210" end="00:28:00.500" style="s2">feel they don&#39;t have power what are the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.429" end="00:28:04.630" style="s2">needs and wants that are disempowering</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.500" end="00:28:09.140" style="s2">you and literally like the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.630" end="00:28:11.240" style="s2">taoist who had to meet the taoist who</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.140" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t know how to use a sword had to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.240" end="00:28:16.760" style="s2">meet the samurai on the bridge and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:20.120" style="s2">went to the guru and the Guru said you</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.760" end="00:28:23.690" style="s2">know don&#39;t do anything just be prepared</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.120" end="00:28:26.840" style="s2">to die just reduce your need to live to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.690" end="00:28:29.330" style="s2">zero and that&#39;s what he did and in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.840" end="00:28:30.740" style="s2">in the samurai felt like oh my god I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.330" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">not going to try to strike him he has</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.740" end="00:28:37.190" style="s2">too much power</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:42.040" style="s2">right so literally this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.190" end="00:28:42.040" style="s2">equation this is part of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.160" end="00:28:54.919" style="s2">when you look at coercion in modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.309" end="00:28:58.940" style="s2">society be careful cuz coercion can</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.919" end="00:29:02.360" style="s2">arise because the person at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.940" end="00:29:07.400" style="s2">of the power equation has too many needs</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.360" end="00:29:11.809" style="s2">and wants and not that the person on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.400" end="00:29:14.650" style="s2">other side is exercising too much skills</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.809" end="00:29:14.650" style="s2">or resources</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.030" end="00:29:25.570" style="s2">I feel coerced to do this by my husband</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.420" end="00:29:28.430" style="s2">why because they&#39;ll get mad if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.570" end="00:29:31.630" style="s2">that&#39;s not necessarily coercion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.430" end="00:29:31.630" style="s2">more complex than that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.990" end="00:29:37.580" style="s2">it&#39;s most often the case because you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.150" end="00:29:39.740" style="s2">can&#39;t self-regulate your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.580" end="00:29:42.700" style="s2">endure the fact that he&#39;s going to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.740" end="00:29:45.640" style="s2">a tantrum like a two-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.700" end="00:29:49.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s your need and want</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.640" end="00:29:52.100" style="s2">lack of to not have that feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.400" end="00:29:55.390" style="s2">he&#39;s mad and your lack of the skill to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.100" end="00:29:55.390" style="s2">self-regulate that feeling</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:19.800" style="s2">it&#39;s also why there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.050" end="00:30:19.800" style="s2">passive-aggressive forms of power</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.310" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">which leverage the other person&#39;s needs</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.740" end="00:30:49.380" style="s2">and wants it&#39;s this form of power yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:54.120" style="s2">have a question I think about this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.380" end="00:30:57.510" style="s2">actually in terms of the multiplication</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.120" end="00:30:59.730" style="s2">of needs and wants but I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.510" end="00:31:02.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a flip side to it where people</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.730" end="00:31:03.480" style="s2">say something like you know living up to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.580" end="00:31:06.660" style="s2">your potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.480" end="00:31:10.290" style="s2">what do you want so little yourself how</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.660" end="00:31:13.160" style="s2">do I make sense of that yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.290" end="00:31:16.260" style="s2">potentials not the same of need and want</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.160" end="00:31:18.030" style="s2">your potential for what to be creative</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.260" end="00:31:22.380" style="s2">your potential to be happy your</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.030" end="00:31:26.790" style="s2">potential to be what you know versus</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.380" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">your potential to minoo consume a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.790" end="00:31:35.490" style="s2">stuff based upon needs or the need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:46.820" style="s2">have external affirmation about your</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.490" end="00:31:46.820" style="s2">life yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.130" end="00:32:02.100" style="s2">I have a question I guess the natural</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.210" end="00:32:07.320" style="s2">thing to ask then is how does one reduce</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.100" end="00:32:10.260" style="s2">or control one&#39;s needs and once I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.320" end="00:32:15.180" style="s2">reading a lot of laconian psychology</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.260" end="00:32:17.730" style="s2">right now where he&#39;s talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.180" end="00:32:20.130" style="s2">lost object of desire that we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.730" end="00:32:26.030" style="s2">all hoping for but it&#39;s not a defined</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.130" end="00:32:33.150" style="s2">object it&#39;s a really like obscure and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.030" end="00:32:34.740" style="s2">it&#39;s just a photo yeah so I&#39;m gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.150" end="00:32:36.060" style="s2">around it and then we can deepen it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.740" end="00:32:38.490" style="s2">because I think you&#39;re asking a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.060" end="00:32:40.950" style="s2">question but I think to give you some</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.490" end="00:32:44.300" style="s2">flavor of just the formula we&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.950" end="00:32:47.370" style="s2">at a higher place a more surface place</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.300" end="00:32:51.470" style="s2">so I ran a landscape design build in</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.370" end="00:32:54.060" style="s2">contracting company for many years and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.470" end="00:32:57.770" style="s2">we worked for the rich and famous and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.060" end="00:33:00.120" style="s2">and all of us loved to do beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.770" end="00:33:02.250" style="s2">landscapes and here out here in</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.120" end="00:33:04.500" style="s2">Northwest Connecticut and the rich and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.250" end="00:33:08.400" style="s2">famous would come and buy you know 75</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.500" end="00:33:09.660" style="s2">acres and have all these ideas and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.400" end="00:33:13.220" style="s2">know we would compete with other</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.660" end="00:33:15.750" style="s2">designers to get those projects and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.220" end="00:33:18.030" style="s2">every once in a while the sales people</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.750" end="00:33:20.070" style="s2">would come like the sales of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.030" end="00:33:21.570" style="s2">designers would come and they would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.070" end="00:33:23.850" style="s2">really excited oh I&#39;m gonna get it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.570" end="00:33:26.970" style="s2">gonna get it I&#39;m like be careful you</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.850" end="00:33:29.580" style="s2">want this project more than the client</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.970" end="00:33:32.220" style="s2">and that means you&#39;re just going to cut</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.580" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">cost cut costs until you&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.220" end="00:33:37.080" style="s2">either lousy job or you&#39;re not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:39.810" style="s2">able to finish it you know and so one a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.080" end="00:33:46.860" style="s2">lot of times it&#39;s really working with</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.810" end="00:33:48.420" style="s2">yourself psychologically so you it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.860" end="00:33:50.760" style="s2">tricky thing you know you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.420" end="00:33:53.550" style="s2">acknowledged that you want that you want</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.760" end="00:33:57.110" style="s2">that job but you have to get some sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.550" end="00:34:00.450" style="s2">of base reality of when is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.110" end="00:34:05.270" style="s2">diminishing your when is it diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.450" end="00:34:10.169" style="s2">reality and in a case you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.270" end="00:34:12.659" style="s2">this happens a lot when we chase after I</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.169" end="00:34:17.159" style="s2">mean the whole marketing and consumerism</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.659" end="00:34:21.990" style="s2">is is built to increase our needs and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.159" end="00:34:24.450" style="s2">wants and you know you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.990" end="00:34:27.840" style="s2">really kind of try to make sense get</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.450" end="00:34:30.300" style="s2">very practical like some like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.840" end="00:34:34.050" style="s2">Quakers the Quakers are not against</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.300" end="00:34:39.600" style="s2">technology they are trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.050" end="00:34:41.159" style="s2">reasonable so if you say well you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.600" end="00:34:43.169" style="s2">it takes a lot of time to get into town</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.159" end="00:34:46.860" style="s2">if we bought a car we could get into</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.169" end="00:34:48.570" style="s2">town faster but then they reason well if</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.860" end="00:34:50.490" style="s2">we bought a car then we&#39;d have to sell</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.570" end="00:34:53.399" style="s2">more goods and at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.490" end="00:34:57.120" style="s2">they realize that the initial need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.399" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">get into town faster is not satisfied by</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.120" end="00:35:05.190" style="s2">that in that by that method so they they</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:08.430" style="s2">don&#39;t but they&#39;re interested in solar</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.190" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">power because it seems to satisfy the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.430" end="00:35:12.990" style="s2">need of having more time to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:16.920" style="s2">contemplative and to do community stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.990" end="00:35:20.430" style="s2">so one of the so then what is the need</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.920" end="00:35:23.310" style="s2">to have the car it&#39;s not a need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.430" end="00:35:25.350" style="s2">satisfy the original desire it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.310" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">looped around some other kind of needs</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.350" end="00:35:32.460" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s and a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:34.290" style="s2">when you do this work you say I do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.460" end="00:35:36.360" style="s2">myself I&#39;ll say the need is just</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.290" end="00:35:38.340" style="s2">manufactured like okay here&#39;s one I</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.360" end="00:35:40.230" style="s2">don&#39;t have a smartphone I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.340" end="00:35:41.970" style="s2">them I think you work for your</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.230" end="00:35:49.950" style="s2">smartphone your smart phone doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.970" end="00:35:52.890" style="s2">for you and so yeah so it creates a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.950" end="00:35:54.420" style="s2">certain type of liberation it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.890" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">when you travel to Europe and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.420" end="00:35:57.390" style="s2">know what you&#39;re going but then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:58.890" style="s2">depend upon other people but then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.390" end="00:36:02.330" style="s2">can&#39;t speak the language so it gets</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.890" end="00:36:06.750" style="s2">really funny stuff like that but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.330" end="00:36:09.330" style="s2">really really want the new Microsoft duo</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.750" end="00:36:12.690" style="s2">you know the thing that opens up like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.330" end="00:36:13.470" style="s2">book right like because it&#39;s like a book</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.690" end="00:36:16.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.470" end="00:36:18.119" style="s2">I want it so bad and I&#39;m already telling</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.200" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">myself it&#39;s not even out yet and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.119" end="00:36:24.450" style="s2">already trying really to ever you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:27.869" style="s2">know don&#39;t get it don&#39;t get it don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.450" end="00:36:32.099" style="s2">it you know and so you can see I can</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.869" end="00:36:35.430" style="s2">feel I can feel that moving in me look</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.099" end="00:36:40.619" style="s2">at the way I do this I mean like I want</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.430" end="00:36:42.480" style="s2">it so bad so you know and sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.619" end="00:36:48.900" style="s2">say yeah I&#39;m just gonna get it you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.480" end="00:36:53.010" style="s2">you don&#39;t always like it&#39;s not um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.900" end="00:36:55.560" style="s2">not necessarily that you don&#39;t do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.010" end="00:36:57.990" style="s2">know the completely rational thing or</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.560" end="00:37:04.470" style="s2">something like that yeah it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.990" end="00:37:06.030" style="s2">rude Rube Goldberg and and so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.470" end="00:37:08.250" style="s2">not about just being efficient you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.030" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">we don&#39;t want we do a lot of things like</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.250" end="00:37:13.619" style="s2">grind your own coffee and make it you</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:15.570" style="s2">know because there&#39;s a lot of value and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.619" end="00:37:17.670" style="s2">beauty in that and we can really enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.570" end="00:37:22.530" style="s2">it so it&#39;s not about efficiency but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.670" end="00:37:25.050" style="s2">just about coming to terms with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.530" end="00:37:27.810" style="s2">driving this equation especially when</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.050" end="00:37:31.260" style="s2">you&#39;re in a situation where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.810" end="00:37:34.530" style="s2">to have to work with someone where the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.260" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">power there&#39;s a power there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.530" end="00:37:46.349" style="s2">flow of force either as Authority or</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:52.380" style="s2">supervisor or yeah so like in</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.349" end="00:37:55.800" style="s2">coronavirus where my local community not</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.380" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">my online community is pretty skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.800" end="00:38:04.260" style="s2">about how serious it is we think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:06.450" style="s2">thing but what we noticed is then we get</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.260" end="00:38:08.670" style="s2">really mad because the government has</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.450" end="00:38:11.339" style="s2">power over us you can tell us to stay</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.670" end="00:38:14.430" style="s2">home and then you can&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.339" end="00:38:16.859" style="s2">about it so but you can ameliorate your</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.430" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">need not to have the government tell you</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.859" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">what to do you know this can cycle so</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">then you can kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.990" end="00:38:35.980" style="s2">position yourself in between what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.600" end="00:38:38.620" style="s2">going on in a way that yeah so so in</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.980" end="00:38:40.150" style="s2">when you&#39;re when you&#39;re fighting against</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.620" end="00:38:42.100" style="s2">the fact that the government has power</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.150" end="00:38:45.010" style="s2">over you you&#39;re just empowering yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.100" end="00:38:47.860" style="s2">even more so how can i reclaim my</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.010" end="00:38:49.720" style="s2">sovereignty in the face of something I</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.860" end="00:38:51.400" style="s2">can&#39;t really do anything about or don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.720" end="00:38:55.000" style="s2">want to do anything about I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.400" end="00:38:57.130" style="s2">not I don&#39;t want to you know let those</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.000" end="00:39:01.930" style="s2">people to take my gun into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.130" end="00:39:04.450" style="s2">Statehouse and make a ruckus so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.930" end="00:39:09.330" style="s2">always kind of balanced it&#39;s a balancing</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.450" end="00:39:13.510" style="s2">act between between both those things</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.330" end="00:39:16.330" style="s2">is it possible to store this potential</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.510" end="00:39:19.120" style="s2">energy so for instance in Corona you</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.330" end="00:39:20.710" style="s2">have a situation where you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.120" end="00:39:22.750" style="s2">anything about it and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.710" end="00:39:25.930" style="s2">suggesting is sort of cut off your needs</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.750" end="00:39:29.160" style="s2">and wants which is a which is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.930" end="00:39:29.160" style="s2">interesting because in the way it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.420" end="00:39:36.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a very retreat mode approach life</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.850" end="00:39:38.710" style="s2">is my sense to it we&#39;re sort of not even</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.330" end="00:39:41.290" style="s2">trying to build our skills we are saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.710" end="00:39:43.480" style="s2">you know what the grapes are sore</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.290" end="00:39:48.340" style="s2">because I can&#39;t have them that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.480" end="00:39:50.500" style="s2">flavor I get and instead why not sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.340" end="00:39:53.050" style="s2">take that feeling of maybe frustration</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.500" end="00:39:55.470" style="s2">or disempowerment and transform that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.050" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">towards maybe I can&#39;t do anything now</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.470" end="00:40:00.130" style="s2">but five years down the line I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:02.530" style="s2">want to be in a similar context how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.130" end="00:40:04.900" style="s2">you apply it because I don&#39;t see how we</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.530" end="00:40:07.450" style="s2">can sort of say okay fine if everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.900" end="00:40:08.680" style="s2">decides to do the thing like Quakers are</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.450" end="00:40:11.050" style="s2">doing we would not even have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.680" end="00:40:13.840" style="s2">technology move forward right so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.050" end="00:40:15.790" style="s2">your comment on that yeah okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.840" end="00:40:17.830" style="s2">perfect so now you understand why it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.790" end="00:40:19.870" style="s2">skills and resources divided by needs</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.830" end="00:40:23.140" style="s2">and wants because I can turn the needs I</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.870" end="00:40:24.880" style="s2">can&#39;t satisfy today and I can work on</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.140" end="00:40:27.460" style="s2">resources that will be helpful in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:31.000" style="s2">future and so and then I bump up my want</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.460" end="00:40:32.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t need the government to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.000" end="00:40:37.220" style="s2">anything different today but what I want</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.860" end="00:40:40.550" style="s2">is a new type of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.220" end="00:40:43.940" style="s2">you see the difference so now and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.550" end="00:40:46.670" style="s2">how those two categories move they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.940" end="00:40:51.080" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re both work you</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.670" end="00:40:53.359" style="s2">work on them more in the future and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.080" end="00:40:55.910" style="s2">think that&#39;s you said stored potential</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:40:58.910" style="s2">resources and wants or stored potentials</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.910" end="00:41:02.540" style="s2">I want a more beautiful world the heart</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.910" end="00:41:06.440" style="s2">knows as possible right so I move that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.540" end="00:41:09.140" style="s2">into this so I can always yeah so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.440" end="00:41:14.900" style="s2">trying to build a sort of other type of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.140" end="00:41:18.920" style="s2">potential and when I in them if I move</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.900" end="00:41:22.010" style="s2">my knee to a want then I see well what</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.920" end="00:41:25.550" style="s2">kind of resources do I need for that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.010" end="00:41:28.340" style="s2">kind of one and so you the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.550" end="00:41:32.830" style="s2">conversation switches but it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.340" end="00:41:37.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s in that it&#39;s in that formula</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.830" end="00:41:43.820" style="s2">because you can&#39;t just want and then say</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.130" end="00:41:45.230" style="s2">well I want this and then yeah you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.820" end="00:41:47.619" style="s2">to then if you have if you move into</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.230" end="00:41:49.820" style="s2">want you have to build future resources</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.619" end="00:41:53.859" style="s2">so you start to do things like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.820" end="00:41:53.859" style="s2">right this is building future resources</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.770" end="00:42:10.150" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m getting how the letting go of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.980" end="00:42:14.170" style="s2">the need want in the moment can free up</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.150" end="00:42:18.280" style="s2">like my system will be less anxious</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.170" end="00:42:21.650" style="s2">disempowered and I would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.280" end="00:42:25.070" style="s2">potentially think more laterally you</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.650" end="00:42:27.380" style="s2">know into you know space and time the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.070" end="00:42:29.180" style="s2">future as your point yet or maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.380" end="00:42:32.859" style="s2">are other people that I can connect with</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.180" end="00:42:35.750" style="s2">that have the skills and resources or</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.859" end="00:42:38.270" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m getting that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.750" end="00:42:43.520" style="s2">yeah once more of a potential built</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.270" end="00:42:45.260" style="s2">state built up and another is but they</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.520" end="00:42:49.010" style="s2">move back and forth you know depending</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.260" end="00:42:51.860" style="s2">upon context and they can and needs can</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.010" end="00:42:55.010" style="s2">draw off of resources</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.860" end="00:42:56.780" style="s2">and skills can build up want so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.010" end="00:43:00.530" style="s2">they&#39;re not just packaged but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.780" end="00:43:02.810" style="s2">all there they&#39;re like the four sides of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.530" end="00:43:07.670" style="s2">the equation and the thing is you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.810" end="00:43:11.060" style="s2">we&#39;re not guaranteed to you know if if</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.670" end="00:43:13.850" style="s2">if power is who gets to move who we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.060" end="00:43:19.670" style="s2">not guaranteed to be the mover you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.850" end="00:43:20.870" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not assured but this</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.670" end="00:43:24.440" style="s2">gives us more</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.870" end="00:43:28.100" style="s2">I think conceptual distinction or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.440" end="00:43:32.210" style="s2">source code to really examine these</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.100" end="00:43:37.790" style="s2">things a little more closely and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.210" end="00:43:39.950" style="s2">know also you know one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.790" end="00:43:42.230" style="s2">started about what one of the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.950" end="00:43:47.450" style="s2">of working with source code is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.230" end="00:43:49.250" style="s2">not like we&#39;re not fighting about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.450" end="00:43:51.110" style="s2">not at the point where Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.250" end="00:43:53.750" style="s2">and Sam Harris talk about power it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.110" end="00:43:56.210" style="s2">already way too complex and filled with</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.750" end="00:43:58.760" style="s2">projections and all this like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.210" end="00:44:03.380" style="s2">territory is too complex can we come</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.760" end="00:44:05.750" style="s2">back down to something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.380" end="00:44:08.740" style="s2">sourced by a feeling a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.750" end="00:44:12.290" style="s2">feeling in our body who gets to move ooh</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.740" end="00:44:15.590" style="s2">even if I if I move psychologically Orma</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.290" end="00:44:18.860" style="s2">medically but this disempowers me if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.590" end="00:44:20.510" style="s2">on the internet and I&#39;m my limbic</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.860" end="00:44:24.620" style="s2">systems like this I&#39;m constantly</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.510" end="00:44:27.830" style="s2">disempowered if I can be on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.620" end="00:44:30.020" style="s2">and have it work for me right because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.830" end="00:44:32.270" style="s2">want to understand the information</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.020" end="00:44:40.280" style="s2">ecology so it&#39;s a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.270" end="00:44:43.070" style="s2">different mode of power that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.280" end="00:44:46.190" style="s2">a really interesting lens into like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.070" end="00:44:49.370" style="s2">aesthetic life the monk is is renouncing</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.190" end="00:44:54.860" style="s2">and and reducing his needs and wants as</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.370" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">a way of well I mean when he does that</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.860" end="00:45:02.570" style="s2">then he feels like he has far more power</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:04.730" style="s2">in his own experience because other</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.570" end="00:45:07.660" style="s2">people have less</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.730" end="00:45:09.470" style="s2">other people or you know nature is</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.660" end="00:45:14.810" style="s2">unconscious or whatever has less</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.470" end="00:45:17.690" style="s2">leverage over him and also like when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.810" end="00:45:20.690" style="s2">said one person excited with it one</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.690" end="00:45:23.210" style="s2">person can move another person like if</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.690" end="00:45:26.210" style="s2">one person moving another person if the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.210" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">other person their needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.210" end="00:45:32.300" style="s2">like you said about the government don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:34.310" style="s2">include not being moved then the one</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.300" end="00:45:36.109" style="s2">person feels like they&#39;re applying power</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.310" end="00:45:38.530" style="s2">and the other person does not feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.109" end="00:45:42.170" style="s2">powerless in that situation which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.530" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s a Tai Chi move right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.170" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">I&#39;m going to be moved this way by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:50.990" style="s2">state and neither do I and then I see</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:53.359" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.990" end="00:45:57.079" style="s2">what&#39;s possible from here you know at a</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.359" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">certain point I can and this is another</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.079" end="00:46:07.940" style="s2">interesting thing about power we relate</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:13.460" style="s2">to what can move us in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.940" end="00:46:18.109" style="s2">and here&#39;s a little trick so if the tree</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.460" end="00:46:23.660" style="s2">is falling on my house or if the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.109" end="00:46:28.190" style="s2">tornados coming to my house I will move</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.660" end="00:46:31.400" style="s2">away really fast right but it won&#39;t piss</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.190" end="00:46:35.810" style="s2">me off in the same way is if a burglar</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.400" end="00:46:38.089" style="s2">came and ran me out of my house in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.810" end="00:46:42.710" style="s2">fact that I respond to the burglar in</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.089" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">that way disempowers me right like when</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.710" end="00:46:48.650" style="s2">if I respond to it like just a situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:51.410" style="s2">of we in reality a situation in nature</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.650" end="00:46:57.740" style="s2">then it doesn&#39;t disempower me the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.410" end="00:47:00.050" style="s2">way but it&#39;s this this inability to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.740" end="00:47:02.569" style="s2">with the fact that other people have an</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.050" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">occasion more power than me dis empowers</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.569" end="00:47:14.450" style="s2">me this took me a long time I had this</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.319" end="00:47:16.819" style="s2">this is a pattern in me like Trump got</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.450" end="00:47:18.180" style="s2">elected many people who are upset for</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.819" end="00:47:22.259" style="s2">various reasons</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.180" end="00:47:24.660" style="s2">I&#39;d lived through Reagan when we all</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.259" end="00:47:27.690" style="s2">just sounds ridiculous now you would</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.660" end="00:47:30.059" style="s2">never know that we had we it affected us</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.690" end="00:47:34.589" style="s2">the same way we had no idea of someone</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.059" end="00:47:36.930" style="s2">like that to be elected okay so did it</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.589" end="00:47:41.009" style="s2">affect me the same way but it bothered</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.930" end="00:47:43.380" style="s2">me a lot right and so I had to try to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.009" end="00:47:44.940" style="s2">figure out why because I wasn&#39;t worried</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.380" end="00:47:47.369" style="s2">for the same reasons other people</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.940" end="00:47:49.559" style="s2">worried I wasn&#39;t like a lot of the other</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.369" end="00:47:51.660" style="s2">things that bother me but what bothered</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.559" end="00:47:54.269" style="s2">me is it really bothers me when</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.660" end="00:47:56.759" style="s2">someone&#39;s less like someone less</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.269" end="00:47:58.890" style="s2">intelligent cognitively complex than me</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.759" end="00:48:01.410" style="s2">has the power to make me do things</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.890" end="00:48:03.509" style="s2">that&#39;s what really bothers me right</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.410" end="00:48:08.490" style="s2">because I&#39;m like a cognitive type right</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.509" end="00:48:11.160" style="s2">so now I also see that you know he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.490" end="00:48:13.349" style="s2">man of action but he&#39;s not driven by his</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.160" end="00:48:15.269" style="s2">own you know he&#39;s he&#39;s reactive and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.349" end="00:48:16.769" style="s2">stuff like that but it took me a while</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.269" end="00:48:18.749" style="s2">like well what is it Bonnie</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.769" end="00:48:21.539" style="s2">like what is it you know and once I saw</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.749" end="00:48:24.329" style="s2">that I would say oh that&#39;s it that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.539" end="00:48:27.660" style="s2">because to me the way the world the fair</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.329" end="00:48:29.910" style="s2">world is not that there aren&#39;t people</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.660" end="00:48:31.769" style="s2">with more power but as you rise the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.910" end="00:48:38.789" style="s2">power they&#39;re more intelligent right</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.769" end="00:48:42.210" style="s2">like so so then and so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.789" end="00:48:45.900" style="s2">people part that the inability to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.210" end="00:48:48.450" style="s2">with what is there&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.900" end="00:48:52.109" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s usually some story in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.450" end="00:48:55.529" style="s2">the fact that we get disempowered when</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.109" end="00:48:58.980" style="s2">more when were moved by other people</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.529" end="00:49:01.079" style="s2">that we don&#39;t want than if it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.980" end="00:49:03.180" style="s2">then if we&#39;re running away from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.079" end="00:49:05.099" style="s2">Bison in Yellowstone Park</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.180" end="00:49:07.859" style="s2">we love the Bison it was like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.099" end="00:49:10.920" style="s2">it was so powerful but if that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.859" end="00:49:14.400" style="s2">person moving us then we start to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.920" end="00:49:19.079" style="s2">meltdown and that&#39;s interesting to look</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:22.920" style="s2">at for different reasons I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.079" end="00:49:26.249" style="s2">about the ways that people have power</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.920" end="00:49:30.239" style="s2">and aren&#39;t aware of it at all or you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.249" end="00:49:31.800" style="s2">know and the ways that they are moving</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.239" end="00:49:35.730" style="s2">others and have</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.800" end="00:49:39.240" style="s2">no consciousness of it and then of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.730" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">course the ways that there&#39;s unrealized</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.240" end="00:49:45.630" style="s2">power and that other people can see it</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:48.110" style="s2">so clearly I just think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.630" end="00:49:51.630" style="s2">interesting relationship to it as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.110" end="00:49:55.410" style="s2">yeah and so for me power is the felt</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.630" end="00:49:58.950" style="s2">sense of the flow of force it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.410" end="00:50:02.820" style="s2">make sense to say to look at two other</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.950" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">people neither of whom feel the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.820" end="00:50:08.570" style="s2">force and say there&#39;s a power thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:12.660" style="s2">going on there have to be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.570" end="00:50:14.940" style="s2">because we tend to then project we</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.660" end="00:50:16.770" style="s2">project that someone&#39;s being coerced and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.940" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re having fun we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.770" end="00:50:25.170" style="s2">so power is the felt sense of the flow</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:33.600" style="s2">of force in this in the human in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.170" end="00:50:36.840" style="s2">human realm if I am walking you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.600" end="00:50:38.250" style="s2">there&#39;s some great videos where people</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.840" end="00:50:40.860" style="s2">are walking across the street and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.250" end="00:50:42.390" style="s2">like two cars hit each other and the guy</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.860" end="00:50:45.150" style="s2">almost gets kills but he doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.390" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t even know it well he</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.150" end="00:50:54.330" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have felt a power coercion or a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:57.330" style="s2">threat or anything you know and so one</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.330" end="00:50:59.190" style="s2">of the things so so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.330" end="00:51:04.860" style="s2">interesting thing you have to be really</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.190" end="00:51:08.820" style="s2">careful - yeah this happens a lot when</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.860" end="00:51:11.160" style="s2">we look at societies with older</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.820" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">structures the men have too much power</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.160" end="00:51:16.050" style="s2">we might say when maybe the women have</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">the power we don&#39;t you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.050" end="00:51:23.370" style="s2">be really careful to feel what is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">felt sense inside this situation now you</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.370" end="00:51:28.410" style="s2">could come in and many times like little</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:33.240" style="s2">dogs have all their all the power over</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.410" end="00:51:35.030" style="s2">the adult because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.240" end="00:51:37.170" style="s2">projection and they&#39;re really good at</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.030" end="00:51:42.750" style="s2">instincts and getting and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.170" end="00:51:44.940" style="s2">that so I think if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.750" end="00:51:45.600" style="s2">relationship counseling or when you work</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.940" end="00:51:47.780" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.600" end="00:51:50.570" style="s2">if you can get the conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.780" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">skills and resources and needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.570" end="00:52:00.360" style="s2">then you can get a sort of baseline of</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:52:04.950" style="s2">where powers flowing the other way we</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.360" end="00:52:12.990" style="s2">use this is someone talked about</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.950" end="00:52:16.860" style="s2">coercion up to co-creation so if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.990" end="00:52:20.040" style="s2">have a large difference in skills and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.860" end="00:52:23.220" style="s2">resources and needs and wants then you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.040" end="00:52:25.740" style="s2">might see it let&#39;s say two people have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.220" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">large difference in skills and resources</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.740" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">and needs and wants and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:37.610" style="s2">coming together to do something together</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:44.790" style="s2">it can look like structurally coercion</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.610" end="00:52:47.130" style="s2">right but it&#39;s actually the only kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.790" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">structure that is capable it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.130" end="00:52:52.860" style="s2">way those two people can self-organize</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:56.060" style="s2">is because just that the power asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.860" end="00:52:56.060" style="s2">is so large</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.320" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">now what that also means so you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.850" end="00:53:06.950" style="s2">think of it the next level up is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:09.560" style="s2">coordinated coordinate if you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.950" end="00:53:11.380" style="s2">very strong and I&#39;m disabled and we want</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.560" end="00:53:13.820" style="s2">to coordinate to move something heavy</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.380" end="00:53:17.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to look like coordination</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.820" end="00:53:21.740" style="s2">because the the power equations are too</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.600" end="00:53:23.870" style="s2">asymmetric so as you move up these what</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.740" end="00:53:26.170" style="s2">we would call higher action logics if</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.870" end="00:53:29.630" style="s2">you think about collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.170" end="00:53:31.730" style="s2">collaboration many people are working in</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.630" end="00:53:33.470" style="s2">teams and they are saying they</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.730" end="00:53:35.270" style="s2">collaborate but it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.470" end="00:53:37.280" style="s2">collaboration it&#39;s distributed roles</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.270" end="00:53:40.610" style="s2">because the power asymmetries are too</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.280" end="00:53:43.910" style="s2">large so there&#39;s a direct relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.610" end="00:53:46.550" style="s2">between working on the power equations</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.910" end="00:53:48.440" style="s2">and teams in order to move up to</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.550" end="00:53:51.170" style="s2">collaboration and certainly co-creation</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.440" end="00:53:54.770" style="s2">I can&#39;t call create with you if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.170" end="00:53:57.560" style="s2">working on software code I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.770" end="00:54:00.440" style="s2">anything about it you know so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.560" end="00:54:02.690" style="s2">times coaches and as a society we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.440" end="00:54:04.430" style="s2">these words we want we don&#39;t want people</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.690" end="00:54:07.340" style="s2">you know we want people moving into</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.430" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">collaboration and co-creation but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.340" end="00:54:10.370" style="s2">not possible if there&#39;s too much too</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:12.920" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.370" end="00:54:15.430" style="s2">asymmetry in their power equation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.920" end="00:54:15.430" style="s2">just not possible</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.630" end="00:54:24.860" style="s2">so you have to work on what would what</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.050" end="00:54:26.750" style="s2">is you know called fit the the power</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.860" end="00:54:28.970" style="s2">equations have to fit the team you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.750" end="00:54:32.210" style="s2">building if you want these higher action</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.970" end="00:54:34.880" style="s2">logics and too often we just think these</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.210" end="00:54:38.780" style="s2">higher action logics our product of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.880" end="00:54:41.420" style="s2">values we have no it&#39;s not a product of</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.780" end="00:54:44.840" style="s2">the values we have it&#39;s a product of</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.420" end="00:54:48.890" style="s2">self system self organize and power and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.840" end="00:54:52.210" style="s2">Trust are always part of that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.890" end="00:54:55.730" style="s2">the protocols for a self organization</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.210" end="00:54:57.350" style="s2">could you go could you a little more</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.730" end="00:54:59.510" style="s2">about that so you&#39;re saying that when</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.350" end="00:55:01.220" style="s2">people are collaborating or co-creating</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.510" end="00:55:05.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not really about value alignment</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.220" end="00:55:09.800" style="s2">it&#39;s about power asymmetry yeah so for</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.270" end="00:55:13.100" style="s2">example it&#39;s pretty easy to see if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.800" end="00:55:15.470" style="s2">very weak or disabled and you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.100" end="00:55:18.920" style="s2">strong and we&#39;d say we want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.470" end="00:55:21.050" style="s2">coordinate moving this very heavy thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.920" end="00:55:26.510" style="s2">even the strong person can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.050" end="00:55:28.370" style="s2">themselves well it&#39;s I might be my value</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.510" end="00:55:30.770" style="s2">that I want to coordinate but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.370" end="00:55:33.650" style="s2">eight-pound symmetry is too is too</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.770" end="00:55:36.080" style="s2">skewed right we won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.650" end="00:55:38.030" style="s2">coordinate our bodies well it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.080" end="00:55:42.050" style="s2">it&#39;s true in the information ecology we</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.030" end="00:55:45.950" style="s2">cannot cope we cannot collaborate are on</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.050" end="00:55:47.690" style="s2">a project if the skill asymmetry is too</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.950" end="00:55:50.630" style="s2">large or the needs and wants are out of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.690" end="00:55:53.780" style="s2">out of line you know I need to work</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.630" end="00:55:57.790" style="s2">three hours a day I don&#39;t care I&#39;ll work</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.780" end="00:55:59.990" style="s2">as long as it takes so to get true</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.790" end="00:56:02.900" style="s2">self-organizing collaboration to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.990" end="00:56:04.550" style="s2">like team flow at these higher action</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.900" end="00:56:06.710" style="s2">logics like co-creation and true</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.550" end="00:56:11.390" style="s2">collaboration you really have to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.710" end="00:56:14.450" style="s2">the right fit in the ecosystem a realtor</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.390" end="00:56:15.770" style="s2">you know you can most teams that they</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.450" end="00:56:20.090" style="s2">think they&#39;re collaborating are</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.770" end="00:56:22.270" style="s2">coordinating distributed roles because</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.090" end="00:56:26.800" style="s2">there&#39;s too much power asymmetry in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.270" end="00:56:26.800" style="s2">in the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.230" end="00:56:38.450" style="s2">so you know you try to you try to train</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.540" end="00:56:43.580" style="s2">up but there&#39;s also a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.450" end="00:56:43.580" style="s2">reality about these higher action logics</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.609" end="00:56:51.750" style="s2">noticed a lot of folks talking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:53.220" style="s2">kind of a monastic approach to reducing</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.750" end="00:56:55.530" style="s2">needs and waltz or reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.220" end="00:56:57.570" style="s2">attachment to meeting needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.530" end="00:57:00.859" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering whether you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.570" end="00:57:03.180" style="s2">encountered or how what you would say to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.859" end="00:57:06.660" style="s2">someone who looks at this equation and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.180" end="00:57:08.940" style="s2">says ah well then I&#39;ll just not mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.660" end="00:57:09.330" style="s2">love or companionship or you know I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.940" end="00:57:11.550" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.330" end="00:57:13.980" style="s2">they might naively do a move of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.550" end="00:57:19.859" style="s2">compartmentalizing or not feeling in</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.980" end="00:57:24.300" style="s2">order to be powerful yeah I mean people</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.859" end="00:57:27.930" style="s2">can snooker themselves you know so the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.300" end="00:57:33.810" style="s2">need to reduce your needs is can be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.930" end="00:57:37.890" style="s2">huge need right or if you have to put</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.810" end="00:57:40.560" style="s2">all your energy into warding desire that</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.890" end="00:57:45.950" style="s2">arises naturally and that&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.560" end="00:57:48.630" style="s2">very resourceful if you can take the I</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.950" end="00:57:51.180" style="s2">mean now we&#39;re getting beyond just a</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.630" end="00:57:54.030" style="s2">simple formula but in general you look</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.180" end="00:57:58.859" style="s2">at needs and wants as energy for free</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.030" end="00:58:00.270" style="s2">and then you need the skill to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.859" end="00:58:02.340" style="s2">going to take this energy and put it</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.270" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">with and put and put it in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.340" end="00:58:07.530" style="s2">I want it to go that&#39;s different than</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:10.260" style="s2">just just saying I don&#39;t like the energy</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.530" end="00:58:12.810" style="s2">of need and want I&#39;m going to suppress</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.260" end="00:58:15.240" style="s2">it or you know a lot of these monastic</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.810" end="00:58:18.810" style="s2">Academy not men asked Academy a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.240" end="00:58:20.790" style="s2">these monastic moves are you know you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.810" end="00:58:24.450" style="s2">fast and you do all this because that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.790" end="00:58:28.260" style="s2">will really suppress the energy of your</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.450" end="00:58:30.510" style="s2">potential so the idea is you have this</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.260" end="00:58:34.170" style="s2">need and want you have this energy that</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.510" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">arises its energy for free it has a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.170" end="00:58:39.540" style="s2">certain amount of power then how do you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:42.450" style="s2">take that thrilling out up to you that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.540" end="00:58:45.150" style="s2">it comes and put it in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.450" end="00:58:47.940" style="s2">that is like positive behavior or toward</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.150" end="00:58:50.069" style="s2">a goal or a resource or your own</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.940" end="00:58:54.510" style="s2">potential or in York the contribution</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.069" end="00:58:58.250" style="s2">you&#39;re me you&#39;ve been created to make in</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.510" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">the world now that could be to be a monk</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.250" end="00:59:04.079" style="s2">that could arise authentically in you</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:08.040" style="s2">but if you&#39;re looking at the monk as an</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.079" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">archetype and wishing you or that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.040" end="00:59:14.700" style="s2">working tirelessly you know that the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:18.420" style="s2">big giveaways if you get more energy</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.700" end="00:59:21.930" style="s2">from it or less and people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.420" end="00:59:24.630" style="s2">Tai Chi masters or so Chen Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.930" end="00:59:30.869" style="s2">teachers to have like literally</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.630" end="00:59:34.440" style="s2">limitless energy hey other people by</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.869" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">contrast seem disempowered or tired or</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.440" end="00:59:44.450" style="s2">distracted and reactionary you know so</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:47.220" style="s2">there is something about this that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.450" end="00:59:49.380" style="s2">appeals to that kind of archetype but</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.220" end="00:59:55.770" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a hundred ways to snooker</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.380" end="00:59:58.380" style="s2">ourselves I don&#39;t think the monastic</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.770" end="01:00:03.930" style="s2">path should be prescriptive cuz it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.380" end="01:00:06.630" style="s2">it&#39;s not everyone&#39;s thing you can you</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.930" end="01:00:07.500" style="s2">can take a shins and yang says you</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.630" end="01:00:11.790" style="s2">nibble</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.500" end="01:00:16.500" style="s2">he said all Dharma is like date on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.790" end="01:00:18.030" style="s2">hook you want to nibble what works for</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.500" end="01:00:20.839" style="s2">you you don&#39;t want to suck you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.030" end="01:00:20.839" style="s2">want to swallow the hook</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.810" end="01:00:33.450" style="s2">but neither can I ask how you would</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.130" end="01:00:38.250" style="s2">frame the giving of respect or deference</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.450" end="01:00:41.430" style="s2">in terms of a Power Exchange yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.250" end="01:00:44.820" style="s2">this is this is similar to the thought</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.430" end="01:00:49.080" style="s2">experiment on nature if the if the bear</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.820" end="01:00:54.630" style="s2">is really powerful right you you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.080" end="01:00:57.180" style="s2">you don&#39;t resent that I moved that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.630" end="01:00:59.610" style="s2">have to move off the path you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.180" end="01:01:02.400" style="s2">like wow that wasn&#39;t that cool you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.610" end="01:01:04.020" style="s2">but this is something that this sense of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:06.270" style="s2">resentment when other people are</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.020" end="01:01:11.010" style="s2">powerful and that means they move us</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.270" end="01:01:15.300" style="s2">this is problematic you either respect</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.010" end="01:01:21.150" style="s2">you know you can both respect and try to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.300" end="01:01:23.640" style="s2">win at the same time or but also the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.150" end="01:01:25.290" style="s2">opposite is true people often present or</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.640" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">they&#39;ll shame themselves because they</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.290" end="01:01:35.250" style="s2">don&#39;t have as much power right so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:36.630" style="s2">so so so don&#39;t you just sort of put your</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.250" end="01:01:38.520" style="s2">answer backs you in another way and see</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.630" end="01:01:41.660" style="s2">if that and see if that&#39;s right would it</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.520" end="01:01:45.120" style="s2">be fair to say that respect is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.660" end="01:01:48.420" style="s2">allowing of that force to move between</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.120" end="01:01:50.010" style="s2">you because you feel like it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.420" end="01:01:52.350" style="s2">valuable to you to do so right so you</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.010" end="01:01:53.700" style="s2">willingly allow force to move in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.350" end="01:01:55.920" style="s2">direction is it something like that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.700" end="01:01:58.620" style="s2">that what respect would be exactly and</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.920" end="01:02:00.930" style="s2">that&#39;s if you&#39;ve honored your own self</p>
