<p begin="00:00:00.110" end="00:00:04.740" style="s2">so this video is just for me to practice</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.429" end="00:00:07.290" style="s2">talking about the project that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.740" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">proposing for the June ballot</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.290" end="00:00:14.580" style="s2">what I want to describe is how we put</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:17.640" style="s2">together to territorial projects one in</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.580" end="00:00:19.500" style="s2">Agua ponds the biosphere reserve in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.640" end="00:00:22.140" style="s2">northern part of Costa Rica and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.500" end="00:00:28.310" style="s2">other in the talamanca region which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.140" end="00:00:31.080" style="s2">one of the most biodiverse and least</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.310" end="00:00:34.230" style="s2">negatively impacted regions of Costa</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.080" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">Rica that&#39;s to the south this is a set</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.230" end="00:00:43.010" style="s2">of mountains of big mountain range that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">then connects into large mangrove and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.010" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">coastal estuaries system with quarries</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">and so these two areas one to the north</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">and one to the south are both primed for</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:58.859" style="s2">being catalyzed into bio regional</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">territories so in both cases there are a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">large number of regenerative agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">projects agroforestry and agro ecology</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:09.810" style="s2">projects retreat centers and training</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:14.270" style="s2">centers where people can learn</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.810" end="00:01:18.270" style="s2">permaculture and other related practices</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.270" end="00:01:22.610" style="s2">efforts to set up food forests and local</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.270" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">schools for helping educate children</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.610" end="00:01:29.180" style="s2">that are aligned with biomimicry</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">approaches or regenerative practices</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.180" end="00:01:35.850" style="s2">also they work at three levels where</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">what this grant we can help create</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.850" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">immediate impacts in specific projects</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">or land parcels so there&#39;s a for example</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">the opportunity to bring in the savory</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">Institute and train farmers who only</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">know traditional practices but are</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">interested in converting their farms to</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">regeneration to help a number of them do</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">this also we can set up a monitoring and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">tracking system and help work with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">territorial councils and create</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">multi-stakeholder collaborations</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:17.010" style="s2">around value exchanges and supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:19.709" style="s2">in the regional economies so that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.010" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">become more visible better understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.709" end="00:02:26.819" style="s2">and then have developments added to them</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">that help them function better based on</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.819" end="00:02:32.550" style="s2">what we learn so our idea here is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:35.160" style="s2">create robust circulation within</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.550" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">regional economies in two parts of Costa</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.160" end="00:02:41.880" style="s2">Rica and doing this in a way that helps</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:44.310" style="s2">us advance a national strategy of making</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.880" end="00:02:46.500" style="s2">Costa Rica the first fully regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.310" end="00:02:49.319" style="s2">nation on earth which we measure by</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.500" end="00:02:53.069" style="s2">keeping it within the donut economics</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.319" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">model advocated by Cantrell worth and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.069" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that I could say about</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:03:02.940" style="s2">that part but the basic idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:05.250" style="s2">that we combine the existing strengths</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.940" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">of many projects on the ground with</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.250" end="00:03:11.340" style="s2">territorial collaborations that are at</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.870" style="s2">the bioregional scale where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.340" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">work has already been done to build</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.870" end="00:03:19.459" style="s2">capacity and infrastructure and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">ready for a mapping process and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.459" end="00:03:25.950" style="s2">capacity enhancement process that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">co-created with the local people this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.950" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">in a sense what we&#39;re trying to do and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:32.790" style="s2">what we want to demonstrate from this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:35.850" style="s2">that guided intentional change can</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.790" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">happen at the territorial level and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.850" end="00:03:42.650" style="s2">we can measure and track improvements of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:46.920" style="s2">circular economy at local project up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.650" end="00:03:48.930" style="s2">local / regional economy levels and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.920" end="00:03:51.299" style="s2">this can be done systematically as part</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:54.269" style="s2">of a larger national systems change</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.299" end="00:03:57.299" style="s2">strategy what the goal that all of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.269" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">is made available to learn and be</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.299" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">replicated by other regions around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.420" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:04.620" style="s2">and we want to do this with the help of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.420" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">a two-year grant from the dawn</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.620" end="00:04:10.200" style="s2">foundation and putting together that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:13.650" style="s2">proposal now so it&#39;s pretty exciting</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.200" end="00:04:16.200" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do and just thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.650" end="00:04:18.870" style="s2">that this little discussion would to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.200" end="00:04:20.340" style="s2">help explain a bit more of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.870" end="00:04:22.530" style="s2">there are a lot of parts involved so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.340" end="00:04:23.550" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t really answer all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.530" end="00:04:26.220" style="s2">questions but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.550" end="00:04:29.550" style="s2">the short video at least gives you an a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.220" end="00:04:33.050" style="s2">sense of how we are building the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.550" end="00:04:35.879" style="s2">learning and capacity building to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.050" end="00:04:38.669" style="s2">implement regeneration at the scale of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.879" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">bioregions something that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.669" end="00:04:42.629" style="s2">learn to do all over the planet</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:43.889" style="s2">I hope this is helpful and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.629" end="00:04:46.069" style="s2">helpful for me to pick it through this</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.889" end="00:04:46.069" style="s2">way</p>
