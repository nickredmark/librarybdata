<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:22.159" style="s2">the london school of economics</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">and i decided in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.159" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">mid early 70s to study social</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:29.360" style="s2">because i&#39;ve been living in notting hill</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">gate</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.360" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">surrounded by people from all over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">world for many years and i decided</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">i need to know more about cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">cultures that have continued for eons of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">the people in notting hill obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">represented in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">cultures from africa from india from</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">bangladesh from</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">sri lanka and so on and so forth so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">wanted to understand better</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">you know how people have been living for</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">all these many many</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">millennia and you know so that was my</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">entry point into trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">study social anthropology and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">really led me to then</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">become an environmentalist because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">became clear that the cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">these people came from were</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">sustainable or indeed regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">cultures</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">and basically could have continued</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">indefinitely if it hadn&#39;t been for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">interference by western society that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">really my entry point and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">in the mid 70s i met satish kumar</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">in london and wrote an article on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">very first issue of resurgency ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">edited in 1973 called the radial house</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">which was basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">designed for an ecological house solar</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">powered house so that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">pioneering stuff i suppose in those days</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">from then on i really worked in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">field ever since</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">but the really interesting experience i</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">subsequently had was</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">i was working with john seymour do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">know the name john seymour yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">course i actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">just be before we got on i dug out his</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">self-sufficiency handbook</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">um and but i thought that he</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">you co-authored the book with him didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">you but not this we did we</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">did a tv series together it&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">we approached the bbc uh to see whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">they might be interested in a tv series</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">on the history of human impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">and eventually we managed to get the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">budget together</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.639" style="s2">with co-productions from germany and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">austria and elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.639" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">and it became a seven hour tv series for</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">bbc two</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">both far from paradise and in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">series we basically traced</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">the impact of mainly western</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">civilization on the environment starting</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">actually not just western but when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">started in iraq with</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">actually no in anatolia the very first</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">villages agricultural bridges</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">uh twelve thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">then we filmed in iraq one of the</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">and the very impacts on the environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">that that came out of</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">it fits very well here i always find it</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">quite telling that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">oldest written record of humanity the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:25.240" style="s2">epic of gilgamesh</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.240" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">desertification it basically says</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">do not cut down the trees otherwise um</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">mesopotamia will run dry</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">and we never learned the lesson well we</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">quoted gilgamesh of course in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">program also there are these clay</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:41.440" style="s2">tablets</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.440" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">in which they recorded the annual yields</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.440" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">of crops from the surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">countryside and gradually they went down</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">and down and down first</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">the wheat yields went down then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">barley yields went down and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">and so on and so forth and what was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:58.080" style="s2">reason for this well it turned out to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">salinization of soils basically water</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.080" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">for irrigation that had some salt</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">content and never flashing</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">that salt water out of the fields so</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">gradually</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">subsidizing the soils feeding or</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">not as a result causing that city</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">ultimately to decline and ultimately die</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a fascinating thing to look at in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">this series</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">how would you because i mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">really talking to to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">the beginning of the problem um with</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.880" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">with us becoming</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.880" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">agriculturalists and city dwellers</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">in terms of like for me more and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:37.400" style="s2">i&#39;m realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">while it seems like a um an</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.400" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">oversimplification if</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">the old wisdom that seems to be common</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">all indigenous cultures that we belong</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">to the earth rather than the earth</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">belongs to us that we are patterned by</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">the land</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">and by life&#39;s processes that we&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">literally expressions of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">and and fundamentally dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">the health of that that process yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:07.280" style="s2">where we went wrong but do you think it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">was directly linked to becoming</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.280" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">farmers and um and city dwellers or</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">where did that come in well i mean as</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">you know i mean we were hunter-gatherers</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:17.440" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:18.879" style="s2">you know hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.440" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">basically only</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">harvesting from nature and always just</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">taking what was available from nature</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">and then when agriculture first started</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">obviously it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">the first stage of a major manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">of nature where basically say okay i</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">have a bit of land here that i grow my</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">crops in and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">that&#39;s my land and that is where i need</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">to get my</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">my food from</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">but then there was a conceptual and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">systemic problem that basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">you can&#39;t harvest from nature and not</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">give back to it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">or from a piece of land and not give</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">back so the question of how to keep that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">land productive and fertile was became a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">major major issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">early on and certainly you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">story of woo and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">on other early towns and in places like</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">mesopotamia</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">are a demonstration of that certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">is also of course if you like the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">fall from</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">from from grace in some ways you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">adam and eve</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">if you if you take that story they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">basically hunter-gatherers</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">and once you get into agriculture you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">have to start manipulating nature as</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">never before</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">that causes all kinds of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">between humans and nature but also</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">the jealousy of people seeing wealth</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">accumulating</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">from you know the sort of intense</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">utilization of nature</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">and wanting some of that themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">kind of tribal wars or wars between uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">tribes</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">who live in adjoining regions and see</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">the wealth of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">of a newly built city and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">conflicts between humans and nature are</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">directly related to the early stages of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">both agriculture and urbanization but</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">that what we now find out more and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:07.560" style="s2">is that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">what what in that frame would be called</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.560" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">pre-agricultural societies</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">were actually practicing just a much</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">more sophisticated form</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">farming or um</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">stewarding uh the landscape being really</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">keystone species</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">in in their interventions like for</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">example what&#39;s pretty clear now is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">most of the colombian rainforest um</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">is a forest garden that evolved through</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">human intervention and with human</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">intervention but humans as nature so</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">similarly in so many other places the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">north american indian</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">planes the the herds of buffalo they</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">weren&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">naturally the way that i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">it&#39;s precisely this false dualism of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">nature and culture that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">that that runs through the even the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">we talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">but but in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:07.560" style="s2">the north american ecosystem before</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:09.120" style="s2">like pre-columbian and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.560" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">pre-colonialization</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">was also a dynamic ecosystem in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">human beings</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">were through fire stick burning</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">and animal like keeping wild herds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">animals</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">um were interfering</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">where would was that shift to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">more primitive form of agriculture with</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">which then also came this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">this is our land like i sometimes wonder</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">whether the ownership of land</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">and that switching perception of rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">than belonging to the la is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">actually more fundamental than than the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">agricultural start what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">well i mean certainly i mean early</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">agriculture was</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">much more collective than than modern</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">agriculture so i mean land typically</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">was kind of not not owned by individuals</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">but it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">utilized by tribes and the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:04.079" style="s2">certainly you know by</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">particularly referring to north america</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.079" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">and south america i mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">tribal agriculture is basically uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">still involves give and take between</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">humans and nature i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">cultivation of crops depended very much</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.200" end="00:12:22.720" style="s2">on utilization of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2">soils uh to ensure that that could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.720" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">done on a continual basis i mean in</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">south america</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">it was particularly slash burn</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">where you you know remove a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">forest and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">burn burn the sticks and then use the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">ash for cultivating the crops and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">after a couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">the forest comes back and the trees we</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">grow and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">the fruit trees that you may have</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">planted then become</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">also harvested by by the animals by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">monkeys by the birds</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">and so on and then you move on to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">next piece of land i spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">making documentaries in the amazon in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">the late 80s and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">so certainly i worked with a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">man called daraposi</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">and with the kaiopo in in south america</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">and brazil</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.760" style="s2">and they he was one of the first people</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:11.519" style="s2">to document the point that you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.760" end="00:13:14.000" style="s2">made which was basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.519" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">the amazon rainforest was very much a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.000" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">it was not a natural forest in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">strict sense of the world but</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:23.279" style="s2">they were everywhere you look there</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">islands of palm trees for instance which</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.279" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">were always an indication that people</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">have lived there</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">and there&#39;s also the traces of very well</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">maintained very rich farmland you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">that that has been found there was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">fascinating documentary made a few years</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">ago by the bbc</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">as the forest is cleared by cattle</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">ranchers and and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">soybean growers suddenly you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">circles and squares emerged out of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">cleared forest</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">and it was clear that that land had</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">already been cleared</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">on a much smaller scale way way you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">in centuries ago and they often left</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">some very rich soils behind was called</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">terra prata it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">an indication of that they were very</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">good at kind of manipulating the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">fertility of the land through</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">putting back manure but also fish bones</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">you know other types of biochar they</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">were they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">biochar yeah all of that was kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">know it&#39;s recently been demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">yeah this is a fascinating story i mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2">the history of agriculture is very</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">complex it&#39;s not always just</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">taking bits of land for a group of of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">tribal people and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">and excluding nature from it as even</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:39.199" style="s2">then you know there&#39;s often a give and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">take between</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.199" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">humans and nature and in forms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">but people are still partly</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">hunter-gatherers and partly farmers</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">and what what in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">life&#39;s journey what began the focus on</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">cities i mean i i remember reading in</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">2001 2002 when</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">briefing on the work that you&#39;ve done on</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">the on the ecological footprint of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">london</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">and yeah you&#39;ve been very involved with</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">london when you&#39;re also involved in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">setting up the carnival</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">in nottingham not not setting up but uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">i moved to notting hill in in the in 60</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">1964 coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">coming from germany you know having</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">decided to study in london for for for a</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">few terms at</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">london university but then i very</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">quickly changed</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">track and basically became a community</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">activist in nautical gate</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">at the store in the portobello road and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">lots of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:37.279" style="s2">crazy stuff going on at that time and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">yes i became involved in</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">helping to run the nottingham carnival</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">in the late 60s and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">yeah i mean as i already briefly</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">mentioned you know i encountered all</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:47.519" style="s2">these people from different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">world that were all living together very</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.519" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">peacefully</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">in that part of north london uh west</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">london and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">so i it became occurred to me that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:57.279" style="s2">need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">you know i became fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.279" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">understanding london</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">as a huge organism because london was</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">modern city of a million people plus</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">from the 18th century on</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">18th century onwards and then grew into</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">a city of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">8.5 million people by by the start of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">the second world war so it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">an unique example of of urban growth of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">a kind that had never been</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">had never occurred before in human</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">history and i tried to understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:28.240" style="s2">how that growth might have occurred</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">obviously the direct linkages between</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.240" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">between the development of steam</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:34.959" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">and london as a center of a global</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.959" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">empire all this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">but then i started to kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">you know where all over the world cities</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:46.160" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">in one way another copying that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.160" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">growth and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">by the time you know by the by the early</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">seventies there were</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">dozens of cities across the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">already of a similar size</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">so i began to think about what is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">impact</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">of that urbanization on on the natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">and at that time i started to think</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">about what people later started called</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">the ecological footprint</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">of of of a big city lag lana where does</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">the food come from where does the timber</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">where does the water come from where all</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">the resources that people take for</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:18.559" style="s2">granted</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">and never really think about on in their</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.559" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">daily way of life</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:26.480" style="s2">than us and i read a brief</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">essay by an american guy called wollman</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.480" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">who had written about the metabolism of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">cities i&#39;ve come up with that concept</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">some years before and i thought it would</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">be interesting to try and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">quantify the resources that flow into</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">london and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">and quantify the amounts of waste coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">out the other end and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">from that also quantify the actual land</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">areas that are required to keep london</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.840" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:51.039" style="s2">and that was kind of i suppose fairly</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">pioneering work at the time this was 85</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.039" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">so 95 1995.</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">and then i started sorry was this that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">was actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">matis vacanade and the official kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">yeah yeah methodology</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">okay well i wrote it i started i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">an uh an</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">essay called metabolism of cities in 89</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:14.320" style="s2">i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">uh and this beginning to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">contrast between</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">the way nature works as a circular</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">system basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">nature cannot exist and continue to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">exist without continuously</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">re-fertilizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">itself as it were i mean if you go into</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">forest</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">in the autumn and see the leaves fall</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">you know that this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:35.039" style="s2">the basis for next year&#39;s growth whereas</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.039" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">you go into a city you never take that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:41.840" style="s2">into account basically you take</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">resources so never mind what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.840" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">the waste</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">so we started to conceptualize or</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">differentiate between linear and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">circular systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">in this essay i wrote in 89 i think it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">and that partly i have to say came out</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">of the work we did on this tv series far</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">from paradise</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">but just another example of what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">looked at in that series was the impact</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">of rome on north africa i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">for about uh 500 years rome</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">also at that time a city of about a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">million people</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">kept you know supplied the bulk of its</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">food from from north africa</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">which had been tamed by by tamed if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">by by julius caesar and other uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">roman generals and basically they turned</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">a forest landscape similar to what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">can still find in places like kenya</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">today acacia far is full of animals</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">zebras lions tigers</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:47.280" style="s2">elephants lions and basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:49.120" style="s2">you know cut down the forest</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">crated up many of the animals and put</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.120" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">them up against the gladiators in rome</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">and elsewhere and then turned</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">the land into farmland so for about 500</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.200" end="00:19:58.160" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:19:59.760" style="s2">they got about 500 000 tons of grain</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.160" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">from north africa</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.760" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">that went into the stomachs of romans</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">then the sewage ended up in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">fertility was never returned to the land</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">of north africa</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">you know there was a permanent legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">lifestyles of romans in this lineage</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">taking resources without returning the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">waste back to the land</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">so that was kind of like a prototype of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">what i</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">then saw in london two thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">later if you like</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">briefly i i remember always remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">this that when i was um</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">14 years old my father who um had a real</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">passion for deserts um it took me</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">to southern algeria we we drove through</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">tunisia into algeria</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">and then down to taman raset and through</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">atlas not the atlas mountains the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.159" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">hogar mountains</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">over a region called um the tassily</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">plateau near janette</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">which is the south um eastern</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">yet southeastern corner of algeria and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">in there</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">in this plateau there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">canyons and in the canyons are um</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">you can find beautiful caves yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">and oasis and cave paintings and and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">cave paintings</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">which struck me after driving with my</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">father</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">2000 kilometers through the desert</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">including a place called the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">the garden of satan which was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">hottest places in the sahara</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">and then arriving in a place where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">cave paintings</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">depicted crocodiles giraffes lions</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">and hippos and in every direction</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">it was two and a half thousand</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">kilometers of desert</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">and and so it&#39;s just another example how</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">the romans continued a process that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">at points um in prehistory</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">most of north africa was was um very</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">much like</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">sub-saharan africa in terms of exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">yes i mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">similar forest cover and similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">vegeta you know fauna as well yes so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">you know the the romans were crated up</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">all these animals and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:13.919" style="s2">you know thousands and thousands ended</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">up in in the coliseum and another</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.919" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">in a similar kind of arenas in the roman</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">empire yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">shocking story so i mean in some ways my</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">interest in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">metabolism of cities didn&#39;t just come</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">living in london uh at that you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">in the 60s early 70s but also from</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:35.200" style="s2">been involved in this tv series apart</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">from paradise for the bbc and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.200" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">you know documenting the impacts also</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">at the plateau wrote about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">deforestation of attica</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">in his critia&#39;s dialogue saying how that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">landscape forest landscape on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">outskirts of athens</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">you know obviously 500 years before rome</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">had also</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">led to the deforestation and permanent</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">damage to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">as a result of the demands uh for</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:04.720" style="s2">resources made by assange</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">on its surrounding countryside and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.720" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">they had</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">pretty ruthless ecological war</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">strategies the way that the romans after</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">they finally subdued cathago they</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">actually spotted the soils</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">they they brought in salt and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">distributed salt on</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">the fertile soils of catago in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">really but subsequently they also</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">you know use that as farmland for</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">it&#39;s an amazing story and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">interesting thing is i mean i filmed in</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">in china we did another tv series</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">uh in 1998 which was</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">filmed in shanghai and at that time we</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:54.960" style="s2">could still see</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">a lot of agriculture being conducted</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.960" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">within the city itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">of small agricultural plots within the</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">and then the surrounding countryside was</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">cultivated basically for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">feeding shanghai</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">about 300 000 hectares of land on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">edge of shanghai at that time still</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">being used</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">to provide vegetables and and so on to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">shanghai but all of that is largely</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">paved over now and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">when they have they are beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">revive urban agriculture particularly</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">for vegetable crops but when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">grains and animal feeds</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">they go long distance they go global now</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">i mean how do after all this research</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">practice because i always remember like</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">when we&#39;re in delphi you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">you shared the story of your work as</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.799" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">redesigned and do you think that there</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">are cities that are simply too big not</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">to fail</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">um and and then the issue because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">early kind of</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">people we have at the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">where do you sit with this issue of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">some of us will have to live in high</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">density areas and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">and and how do we um make cities</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">regenerative well do you mention this</p>

<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:18.159" style="s2">as premier of south australia there was</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">a problem at the time of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.159" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">the water supply to athlete which is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">city region of 1.2 million people</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:29.840" style="s2">uh from the very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:31.760" style="s2">bit of a trickle of a river called the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:32.799" style="s2">murray river which was drying up at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.760" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.799" end="00:28:36.240" style="s2">so they were getting really concerned</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">cooked out the city region continued to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:40.399" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">so then basically out of this concern</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.399" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">about water supply they said well should</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">we have a look at the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:48.960" style="s2">system how the city works city region</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.960" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">so my job was basically to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">adelaide in south australia which is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">population of 1.7 million people in</p>

<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">and so basically i</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:06.320" style="s2">did this for 10 weeks you know endless</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">numbers of seminars and</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">basically it was all implemented the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">entire</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">32 month plan was implemented so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">become you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">from a point of view energy for instance</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">it&#39;s over 60 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:48.640" style="s2">energy electricity supply now comes from</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">solar and wind</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.640" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">they build the world&#39;s largest battery</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">in order to even out the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">fluctuations of renewable energy this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">the work with tesla is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">yeah the tesla battery yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">100 of the organic waste is now returned</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">to local farmland there&#39;s still a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.559" style="s2">agriculture on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">on the edge of adelaide and in south</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">uh water recycling uh</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.919" style="s2">and so forth so i mean it is an example</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">of a city region</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.919" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">that really has looked at itself and say</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">okay we can do things differently</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">in addition to being you know really</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">very sustainable in terms of its</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">resource use</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:39.159" style="s2">uh or indeed regenerative because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">you know all these process</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.159" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">recircularizing the metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">of adelaide goes beyond sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">and so certainly uh it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">nice thing project you have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">involved in</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">but i&#39;ve never been able to replicate it</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">i&#39;ve not never had another opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">to do something similar elsewhere you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">know so</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">i did a lot of work on london and we had</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">something called the sustainable london</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">trust</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">some years before that and we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">published reports about how london</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">would think of itself as a place that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">could function very differently</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">also made a documentary for channel 4 on</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">london&#39;s metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">and we looked at the inputs of resources</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:22.640" style="s2">into london</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">use of materials in london&#39;s economy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.640" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">then where do the waste stand up</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">but that was just before ken livingston</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">mayor of london but again i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">a little bit of tweaking that has gone</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:40.640" style="s2">but by and large you know cities like</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">london are so preoccupied with</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.640" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">their own wealth and their their their</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">power as financial</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">centers and a service economy centers</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to get cities that are so</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">used to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">taking resources from the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">world particularly in the case of london</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:01.440" style="s2">the heart of you know the british empire</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">and then saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.440" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">this could function quite diff so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">i certainly haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">examples yet of other major city regions</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">trying to do something similar and i was</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">able to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">with my ground in in adelaide in south</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">australia have you ever done any work</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">um puran desai and sue riddleston and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:23.679" style="s2">the the buyer</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">i hope to get them going actually when</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.679" end="00:32:28.159" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">bioregional yes i mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">he used to come to my lectures in london</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">but didn&#39;t didn&#39;t they um start a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">of at least kind of suburb projects or</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:40.960" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">some like parts running these um</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.960" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">looking at this one planet or yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">know yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">yeah what do you think it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:50.880" style="s2">aspiration basically you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">we see the beddington zero energy</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">development which they have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:58.960" style="s2">get going or you know it&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">example of what one can do in in cities</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.960" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">but the architects</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:04.799" style="s2">who who designed this he&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.799" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">bill dumpster bill dunster</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ve never been able to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">something on a similar scale elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.840" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">but you know there&#39;s good examples</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">popping up from various places</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">mainly on a small scale sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a lot of work going on</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">on eco villages as well you know but</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">by and large as you said earlier on i</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">mean we have to find ways if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:30.559" style="s2">serious about living in an urbanizing</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.559" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">we have to find ways of making these</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">cities function very very differently</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">but how would you how would you see that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">because on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">of course the it&#39;s clear that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">produce energy food water as cl</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:51.679" style="s2">close to home as possible in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">actually regenerates that resource</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.679" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">rather than depletes</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">it um but that&#39;s easily said</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">conceptually</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s it&#39;s wonderful to like we we</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">see a</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">revival of urban farming in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">in parks and in um yeah all of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">wherever</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">they say same with some of the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">farming might</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">offer a little bit of additional food</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">production in cities</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">but um of course there it&#39;s always going</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:22.040" style="s2">to be a balance in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">like re-regionalizing to what extent or</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.040" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">re-localizing at the city scale</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">and what&#39;s your sense um how</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:32.839" style="s2">if we if we made that decision of trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.800" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">to close the loops as close to home as</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.839" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">what percentage of the main consumptive</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">cycles could we actually relocalize 50</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">70 percent or well you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">differentiate between various crops i</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">mean i think you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">not with vegetables and fruit crops and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">obviously that</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">you know there&#39;s been a movement in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">direction for a long time i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">a vigorous</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">global campaign on urban agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">particularly of course with</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">poorer cities where food supply is</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:08.000" style="s2">a serious issue where waste pollution or</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">particularly of organic waste</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.000" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">is a problem where people say okay why</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">don&#39;t we use</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.119" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">the sewage the the feces the animal</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">waste</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.400" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">for localized food production systems so</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a lot of that happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">in different parts of the world i had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">great time in havana cuba</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">some years ago where they were did that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">very effectively</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">partly out of necessity of course but</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">that&#39;s another long story</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">but a lot happening with urban</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">agriculture when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">when it comes to vegetables and some</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">fruit production and as you said</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a lot happening now with</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">with vertical farming and so on</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">but when it comes to grains you see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">a different story altogether</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">i mean when i did this study on london&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">ecological footprint</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">which was which at that time i</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">quantified as being about 125 times</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">london&#39;s surface area roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">productive land of the uk</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">uh you know the fruit and vegetables are</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">not a very large part of that and in any</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">at the moment most of that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">spain from</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">america in in southern spain</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">which is huge areas of greenhouses</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:18.000" style="s2">probably know</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">but when it comes to grains and animal</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.000" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">feeds we&#39;re talking about really very</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">large acreages 50</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">60 times the surface area of a given</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:27.359" style="s2">city</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">that&#39;s where it&#39;s much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.359" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">relocalize that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">in the case of london historically when</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">they abolished abolish the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">the corn laws in the mid 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:39.520" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:40.720" style="s2">kind of moved towards getting more more</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.520" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">and more of the grain</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.720" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">particularly the barley for bread</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">production</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">and also the animal feeds from north</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:53.119" style="s2">from canada uh and from other parts of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.119" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">so i mean if you wanted to uh get</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.839" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">serious about london</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">supplying most of its grain again from</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">the uk you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">much of the surface area of the farmland</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">in this in this country</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">but of course london has only got 12</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.119" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">percent of the uk&#39;s population</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">so you know where does bristol where</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">does birmingham get its brain from</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.400" end="00:37:18.079" style="s2">but you&#39;re still talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">territories else earth</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.079" end="00:37:21.760" style="s2">in different parts of the world but i</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot can be done if we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">serious about changing the way we do</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">things but for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">you know global trade and free trade is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">still the name of the game</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">globalization has you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">intensified that development more than</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">ever</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">in human history so we are now you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">global exchange is what we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">in terms of food in terms of all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">other supplies so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">we are obviously with britain going for</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">brexit it may be</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">may be interesting to see whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">there might be some change in direction</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">regarding food production but by and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:00.480" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">we&#39;re talking still about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.480" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">game of global supplies</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">rather than relocalization but</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to get is less the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:12.240" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">that unfortunately is still prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.240" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">but more</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">on the basis because you&#39;ve also done</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">this work on regenerative cities with</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">the world future council and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">and published a book on regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">cities um</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">when was it 2015</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:31.680" style="s2">14 and um you must have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">have a sense of if the political will</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">was there</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">if even</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.560" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">the business sector like the private</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:42.320" style="s2">sector would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">we&#39;re willing to restructure how we</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.320" end="00:38:45.359" style="s2">exist even the size</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">at which we exist into different</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.359" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">networks in order to refit the human</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">presence on earth and human impact on</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.280" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">to the biophysical boundaries and create</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">more equity in the process like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">let&#39;s assume</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">we&#39;d say let&#39;s implement the donut in</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">cities like like kate rayworth is trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">now um what&#39;s your sense from having</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">looked at the figures for so many years</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">what is actually possible because of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">course like we</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">we can relocalized food production but</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">there are all these other materials</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">streams where we</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">we are dependent on certain technologies</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">that we probably would want to use in</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">the future as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.839" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">maybe not as ubiquitously as we use them</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:32.800" style="s2">now if</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">if the resource limit is such but but</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.800" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">how would you see that process and also</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:40.079" style="s2">the link with cities with their region</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:43.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.079" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">if we&#39;re moving into the u.n decade for</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.520" end="00:39:48.800" style="s2">ecosystems restoration right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:51.359" style="s2">um what once we</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.800" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">look at the impact of cities which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.359" end="00:39:55.839" style="s2">vast on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">um we also need to look at how to shift</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.839" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">that around and make</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">of course the demand of the city&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">driver</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">of regenerating and restoring the</p>

<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">well i mean obviously in in my in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">regenerative cities we</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">have about 20 case studies where various</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">on a limited scale i mean i obviously as</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">a it&#39;s already referred to i&#39;ve got the</p>

<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">probably the most remarkable uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">turnaround that that you can probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">find anywhere but by and large</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">there are smaller niches of various</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">certainly you know the reality that</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:06.640" style="s2">think in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">debate i mean there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">discussion on the future cities there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">any number of organizations</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">that in one way another tried to deal</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">with urban sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">but there&#39;s eclair the international</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">but by and large the understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a conceptual systemic</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">problem between</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">an urbanizing world and the ever greater</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">impacts on the global environment</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">from the demand patterns of cities</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">difficult to bring that message home to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">to thinkers so for instance just one</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">basic point is i mean we when london</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">grew in the 19th century so very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">there was this huge problem about what</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">to do with sewage</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">so the thames was full of shit basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">and they said what can we do about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">and so they had</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">various consultants come to advise</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">london at that time</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">and so some people said well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">recycle this stuff particularly a german</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">guy called leaving justice</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">let&#39;s recycle this stuff and put it back</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">on the farmland</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">and then keep farmland productive in</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:25.599" style="s2">that way because</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">you realize that you had to return all</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.599" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">the nutrients contained in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">which back to farmland in order to keep</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">it productive</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">that long story short they went for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">different approach which basically they</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">chucked the whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">all of it into the thames estuary not to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">return it to the lamb</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">so then leaving said okay if we are not</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">going to return</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">the nutrients from london back to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">farmland we have to develop artificial</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">fertilizers</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">so that there&#39;s a direct link between</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">london&#39;s decision to go linear</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">in terms of its resource use</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">particularly plant nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">resource use and and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">decision</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">to uh basically chuck this stuff into</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">the thames history instead</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">whereas today we have all the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">cities basically doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:13.599" style="s2">but when you look at the world&#39;s major</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">rivers and the estuaries particularly</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.599" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">you know the large history such as the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">mississippi for instance</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">so you have a large surplus of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">fertilizers</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.240" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">from farmland and and dead zones is all</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">ending up</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">together causing dead zones</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">huge dead zones in estuaries so this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">a huge</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:38.960" style="s2">conceptual problem the same thing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">happening with the yellow river with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">yangtze with the rhinest situation is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:45.599" style="s2">little bit improved in recent years but</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:47.119" style="s2">by and large</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.599" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">this conceptual problem and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.119" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">relationship between cities</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">they use the farmland their refusal to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:57.040" style="s2">to recycle the stuff and then at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">same time taking ever more farmland</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.040" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">to feed you know an ev ever more</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">meat-hungry</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">population so we are certainly you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">it would be nice to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">very positive and optimistic in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">but for the moment we are not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">really serious</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">uh change in direction in in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">crucial</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">systemic context and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:24.720" style="s2">are you i mean one of my great</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">inspirations for thinking about cities</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.720" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">and and also</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">thinking about systemic</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">re-patterning particularly at the scale</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:36.960" style="s2">of the region is sir patrick eddis and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:39.599" style="s2">the work that he did</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.960" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">in the yeah sure because he worked on so</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.599" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">many levels i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">he was great he was he&#39;s got all these</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">uh these points were you know certainly</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">in his thinking yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">but not because he was on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">he was a thinker but he was also a</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">practitioner the way that he</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">being professor at the university of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">dundee um</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">actually moved into the slums of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">edinburgh around the castle</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">and then worked with the prostitutes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">low lives to to basically begin a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">process of gentrification he invented</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:09.920" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">student union to bring the students into</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">that slum</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:14.240" style="s2">area because he understood that when</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">they were there things would start</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.240" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">really okay he invented</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">the edinburgh festival by bringing</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">heckle and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">and and people like kropotkin and all</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:29.839" style="s2">people to um scotland</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:31.599" style="s2">with a clear because he had this</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">experience when he traveled</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.599" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">as a younger man in bavaria and got</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">served in a country um</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">country restaurant or country</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.079" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">and he was surprised by the level of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">education of all the people</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:53.359" style="s2">um working in that inn and and so he</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:55.119" style="s2">really started this conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.359" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">scotland that really</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.119" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">led to a cultural blossoming of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:00.880" style="s2">region and a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">shift in the in the scottish education</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.880" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">um system like even the the celtic</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">revival he was also involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:11.359" style="s2">bringing</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">the the myth of the old celtic legends</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.359" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">back into connection with scotland and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.200" end="00:46:16.400" style="s2">all of that mixed</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:18.079" style="s2">with the art deco time and like the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.400" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">huge steel time</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.079" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">fascinating man and and i i want to read</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">up more about him i mean i obviously</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">read some of his work but not recently</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">so i&#39;m glad you&#39;re reminding me of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.720" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">but i mean certainly i think your work</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">on on regenerative cultures i think is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">also where i&#39;m heading strongly to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s clear that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:39.920" style="s2">you know just looking at this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">physical metabolism of cities</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">is only one aspect of of the story that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">yeah you see it needs to be internalized</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">deeply in the cultural context</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">in which we live and so i&#39;m really very</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">respectful of what you&#39;re doing in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">context i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.440" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">i&#39;m also with the club of rome and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">world future council we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">very much focused on cultural change</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">the physical changes that are needed to</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">bring about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:08.800" style="s2">reconciliation if you like between</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.079" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">humanity and the global environment</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">so these are deeper issues beyond beyond</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">just the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">physical metabolism of cities yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">good that you mentioned the club of rome</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">i&#39;m curious because you&#39;ve been a member</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">of it for quite some time</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">and and even within the club of rome it</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">seems like there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">a culture shift happening right now from</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">what well i mean i know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">involved with the club um and it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">seems to be a slow shifting away</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">from the legacy of a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">limits to growth everything has to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">computer modeled and very</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">data driven and and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">hard science driven to understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.240" style="s2">sociological cultural dimension the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">worldview dimension</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.240" end="00:47:55.599" style="s2">the the fact that you can&#39;t make people</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:11.119" style="s2">behavior changes because of a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">world view and a shift in understanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.119" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">can i just can i just stop you for a</p>

<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">now it would be useful to know how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">edit this out there is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">pausing the recording let&#39;s try that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">so yeah yeah so i mean obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">the club of rome&#39;s story is quite</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">interesting in his overall context</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">initially from the 1970s onwards with</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.680" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">limits to growth i mean that was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">fascinating study</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">you know computer model of what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">future is likely to hold</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.359" end="00:49:03.359" style="s2">and certainly the collision course</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">between humanity and the environment was</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.359" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">starkly represented by by that work and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">conceptualized and quantified for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">first time in a remarkable way</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">so certainly the club of rome if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">for many years it lived off this glory</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:21.280" style="s2">of that work</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">but also of the very controversial</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.280" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">nature of it because</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.119" end="00:49:29.599" style="s2">the world&#39;s futurist hated</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">that there might be limits and so for</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">herman khan in america was at that time</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">the leading</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.400" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">features he was one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">opponents</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">to the idea that there could be any</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">limits to progress to</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">this sort of march of civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">so yeah for many years there was lots of</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">other reports written and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">about particularly around this issue of</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">limits</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">but then gradually uh you know it became</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">clear that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">one can solely concern oneself with that</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:04.559" style="s2">particular perspective</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:06.480" style="s2">so more recently you know there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">of attempt to try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">bring in bring new dimensions into this</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">work and so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:15.920" style="s2">cultural change in the deepest sense is</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">becoming much more important but also of</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.920" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">course rethinking economics i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:21.440" style="s2">heavily involved and work on reframing</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:23.520" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">for the club of rome recently and of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.520" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">course you mentioned the donut concept</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">of one of the members of the moment ago</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s a lot of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">underway i mean it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">but i mean it we have a strange</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.839" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">the main author of the club of um limits</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:47.599" style="s2">the growth report dennis meadows</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">together with his wife former wife</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.599" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">danella and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:53.920" style="s2">she&#39;s slightly no longer with us</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">basically dennis is now saying well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.920" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">too late</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">we can all no longer expect you know a</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">reconciliation</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">ultimately between humanity environment</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">the impacts the pressures the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">human numbers the demand on resources</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">if you add it all up together you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:13.839" style="s2">you cannot imagine a scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">basically we can reverse</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:17.839" style="s2">this collision course that we are on so</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly obviously</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">quite a depressing perspective i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">depressive</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">sort of guy really i always try to find</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.359" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">so yes i mean we are working on on</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">consciousness change</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">uh what could what could a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">civilization look like</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">we are working on as i said reframing</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:38.240" style="s2">economics and particularly of course we</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">are concerned</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.240" end="00:51:42.160" style="s2">and linking up with young people and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:44.800" style="s2">you know these wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.160" end="00:51:45.599" style="s2">young you know campaigners who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.800" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.599" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">we do not accept that we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:54.319" style="s2">that we are going to have to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">your sins</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.319" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">like greater timber and so many of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:02.559" style="s2">colleagues are now saying so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">in some ways an incentive for the club</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.559" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">of rome</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">indeed also for the world future council</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:09.839" style="s2">to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.720" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">you can no longer accept this deeply</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.839" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">depressing scenario that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.760" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">comes from the work of some of the like</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">the forefathers of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">of of you know the club of rome but we</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">are trying very hard to kind of try and</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">see whether or not we can come up</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.280" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">with positive perspectives but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:29.359" style="s2">easy these days and i&#39;m sure you are</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">healing of that yourself and your own</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.359" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">work when we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">really faced with very stark realities</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">in the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:40.400" style="s2">human numbers multiplied by by you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">ever greater demand for resources</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.400" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">increasing living standards particularly</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">in developing countries or</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">positive along the country like china</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">obviously these are all factors</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">that we are trying to have to have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">get to grip with and it&#39;s not easy to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">no i mean it it the fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">situation is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">the only place of hope is actually to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">some extent</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">beyond the frame of a linear data</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.640" end="00:53:10.880" style="s2">um and modeling uh perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">situation like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.880" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">all wonderfully useful to have these</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">but um in many ways we now have to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:21.520" style="s2">the impossible</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">because the likely and the probable</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.520" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">based on on scientific models</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">is literally unthinkable and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">unconscionable</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:34.079" style="s2">um so so we we we need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">somehow work miracles in</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s in the in the dual</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">of preparing</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">for the decades of the next three four</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">yeah the next three four decades um</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.240" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">in the holding the real possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">it is too late and that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:56.480" style="s2">prepare for a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:58.240" style="s2">climate unstable and and for many other</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.480" end="00:54:00.720" style="s2">reasons unstable world</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.240" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">and but that the logical response to</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.720" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">that would still</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">be a trying to heal the place in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:07.040" style="s2">region you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:08.559" style="s2">re-regionalizing production and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.040" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">consumption to create more</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">redundancy and resilience built climate</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:17.119" style="s2">resilience built the capacity for people</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">to um cooperate and collaborate in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:22.400" style="s2">face of calamity</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">um as as a as a direct goal of political</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">policy</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:27.680" style="s2">and which means re-regionalizing</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">political processes</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.680" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">it means all of that yeah sure economic</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">systems um</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">but in that i think is also the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">potential pathway towards</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:39.119" style="s2">the regeneration of patterns that would</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">then actually heal</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.119" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">both social and ecological systems to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:46.079" style="s2">the point that i still believe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to to some extent turn</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.079" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.200" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">the tide of cataclysm um and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">um regenerate ecosystems because we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.839" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">so many</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.400" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">amazing examples of where where that has</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:02.960" style="s2">been achieved yeah now of course i mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:04.640" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.960" end="00:55:06.960" style="s2">you work with john leo i think some of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.640" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">the time but he&#39;s an old mate of mine as</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.960" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">well so yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:11.440" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s documented wonderful stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s going on in china</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">you know and you know the reforestation</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.440" end="00:55:18.319" style="s2">there in the yellow river happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:20.960" style="s2">in ethiopia and elsewhere i mean a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">of tree planting going on in ethiopia</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.960" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">uh yeah certainly i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">wonderful initiatives on tree planting</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">in many places now</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">but then you see the pictures of you</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">know the burning rain forest and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.000" style="s2">and the the burning forests of siberia</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:38.000" style="s2">and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.000" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">yeah you know we are busy in some places</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.000" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">of the world of some parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">to replace lost vegetation</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.319" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">but then in others you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:49.520" style="s2">going up in smoke so yeah i mean i&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:54.319" style="s2">every possible initiative on</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:55.200" style="s2">regenerating ecosystems obviously i mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.319" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">for me you know the the main if you like</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:01.599" style="s2">the gospel of the future</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">regenerative activities of all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.599" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">regenerative energy i mean it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">it&#39;s renewable energy when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">absolutely remarkable that we are now</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">seeing more investment</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">total you know annual capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">wind and solar than we are seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">coal-fired power stations and</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">gas fire process also all of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">great but i mean it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">difficult when you come to very large</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">urban systems like 10-20 million people</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:33.040" style="s2">to power those with renewable energy to</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">get them to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.040" end="00:56:37.200" style="s2">fully regenerative in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:39.119" style="s2">food supply so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.200" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">i mean in china they&#39;re talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.119" end="00:56:42.480" style="s2">ecological civilization</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:44.720" style="s2">which is quite a quite good thing but</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.480" end="00:56:46.640" style="s2">it&#39;s all about china itself so they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.720" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">done a lot of replanting and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">they&#39;re moving quite rapidly into</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:53.839" style="s2">renewable energy but they&#39;re also still</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">building coal-fired power stations as</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.839" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">and they are i mean when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:57:01.200" style="s2">really big cities they are running on</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:03.680" style="s2">on very large dams some of them for</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:06.480" style="s2">instance the street gorgeous dam</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.680" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">chongqing powers parts of shanghai and</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.480" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s all good stuff but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">time when you look at these enormous</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">global footprints</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">of a country like china particularly</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">animal feeds you know then you are</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:21.599" style="s2">worried again and saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">i feel myself constantly in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.599" end="00:57:26.160" style="s2">balance of okay here are the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">positive initiatives that are showing us</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.160" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">where we could go</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:31.599" style="s2">in different directions globally uh we</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">are seeing all this stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:35.200" style="s2">also in the context of covet for</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">instance i mean everybody&#39;s suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.200" end="00:57:37.200" style="s2">growing vegetables again you know which</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.200" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">great i mean you know a lot of friends</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">of mine who</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">for many years would just buy their</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:46.160" style="s2">vegetables in the supermarket</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:48.079" style="s2">suddenly growing vegetables again we</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.160" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">have even got you know set up on our</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.079" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">own plot of land here a few people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">wanted allotment you know say okay you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">can have a plot here</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">on our few acres that we have and grow</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:58:00.160" style="s2">your vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">all great stuff just whether or not that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.160" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">can compete with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:06.319" style="s2">global picture of where we are still</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">looking very different direction sadly</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.319" end="00:58:10.480" style="s2">yeah no i i sense that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">redesign but</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.480" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">not just on the supply side but heavily</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:16.720" style="s2">on the demand side in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:18.240" style="s2">um that we actually open up a</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.720" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.240" end="00:58:22.799" style="s2">um quality of life and quality of human</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">relationships and the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.799" end="00:58:26.960" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:29.359" style="s2">more than nature that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:30.319" style="s2">leads to a redesign of how we live and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.359" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">and what we want</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.319" end="00:58:33.440" style="s2">and and our patterns both in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">diet and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">other forms of patterns of consumption</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.839" end="00:58:43.520" style="s2">i mean you mentioned the pandemic um</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:46.480" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m wondering whether also that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.520" end="00:58:48.240" style="s2">trend that seemed so unstoppable of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:50.319" style="s2">um more and more people moving into</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">cities like certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.319" end="00:58:54.400" style="s2">in india and in a number of places where</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">since the pandemic started</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.400" end="00:58:59.040" style="s2">beginning to see a um reverse of that a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.440" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">little bit of a reversal yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.040" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">question that&#39;s that&#39;s a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:04.160" style="s2">reversal of whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">just a temporary response here but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.160" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly happening but in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">world where</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">where um periodic lockdowns</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.359" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">into your apartment or immediate living</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">space no matter how small it might be</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">for some</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">less privileged families um is is part</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:20.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:21.040" style="s2">the new pattern that might happen more</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">regularly</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering um whether we</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to see</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">a a new revival</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.839" end="00:59:37.359" style="s2">of smaller village and</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.079" end="00:59:39.839" style="s2">and smaller town living and</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.359" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">and also because through the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.839" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:45.599" style="s2">the hesitation to let people work from</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:48.240" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.599" end="00:59:50.240" style="s2">has disappeared because so many uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.240" end="00:59:52.000" style="s2">employers have to do it now</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.240" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">and in the process they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.000" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">beginning to realize that that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:57.920" style="s2">they don&#39;t need to have such large</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.920" end="00:59:58.559" style="s2">offices and have everybody come in every</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.920" end="01:00:01.680" style="s2">morning and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.559" end="01:00:04.000" style="s2">the masses um footprint of of</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.680" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">commuting might be reduced if people</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.000" end="01:00:07.200" style="s2">only go to</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:09.040" style="s2">the office one or two days a week and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.200" end="01:00:13.440" style="s2">work from home the rest of the time</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.040" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">or even with more people working</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.440" end="01:00:16.960" style="s2">much further away from the central</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">office in</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">in small towns and villages um</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">yeah maybe maybe we&#39;re really seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:27.760" style="s2">beginning of a deeper transformation</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">because also with regards to soils i</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.760" end="01:00:30.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen this but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:32.240" style="s2">european union has just started a</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.960" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">program where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.240" end="01:00:35.920" style="s2">very much focusing on soil health as</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:40.240" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.920" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">sure and aim for the next 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.240" end="01:00:43.760" style="s2">well that&#39;s all good stuff and i mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.760" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">the way where we live now partly</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">resulted from what was happening in</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">london in the 70s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:56.559" style="s2">at that time we were faced with a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:01:00.319" style="s2">major economic crisis and a huge</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.559" end="01:01:01.760" style="s2">union you know sort of fights between</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.319" end="01:01:04.319" style="s2">trade unions and government and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.760" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">companies and so on blackouts and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.319" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">really i mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.520" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">it was an extraordinary time so there</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">was hundreds of thousands of people i</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">thought i moved out of london</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:17.680" style="s2">ended up moving to where we went to</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">small holdings smaller towns villages</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">uh into mid wales and west wales into uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:25.680" style="s2">herefordshire and so on it was a major</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:26.319" style="s2">trend at the time there&#39;s no doubt about</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.680" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">it i mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.319" end="01:01:30.319" style="s2">even a lasting trend i mean a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:32.079" style="s2">people when you when i</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.319" end="01:01:34.240" style="s2">speak to people around where we live in</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.079" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">south wales a lot of people at one point</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.240" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">lived in london</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">you know or certainly in bristol and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:42.720" style="s2">birmingham with bigger cities</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:44.880" style="s2">and i mean certainly we are seeing new</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.720" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">opportunities as you already pointed out</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.880" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s no doubt that more people</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">will be able to work more remotely than</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:53.520" style="s2">they will be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">able to do before similarly also global</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.520" end="01:01:56.559" style="s2">travel i mean i think uh people have</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">realized that they can do zoom</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.559" end="01:02:01.839" style="s2">conferences like we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">uh much more regularly than they they</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.839" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">were used to in the past so</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:07.200" style="s2">yeah i mean you know when you look at</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">the skies you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.200" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">we have we are on the overhead route or</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.039" style="s2">the route between</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.799" end="01:02:14.799" style="s2">israel airport and the united states and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.039" end="01:02:18.559" style="s2">there&#39;s phallus airplanes</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.799" end="01:02:21.039" style="s2">flying overhead yeah you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.559" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">four months six months ago so yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.039" end="01:02:25.119" style="s2">think we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:27.039" style="s2">certainly see some major trend changes</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.119" end="01:02:29.359" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right about some people</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.039" end="01:02:31.039" style="s2">in in you know india may be having</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.359" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">second thoughts about</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.039" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">you know living in villages rather than</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:36.480" style="s2">living living in delhi or in mumbai or</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.280" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">something but</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.480" end="01:02:40.400" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s all about having an</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:43.599" style="s2">economic base you know and as long as</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.400" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">cities are magnets for people who who</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.599" end="01:02:47.839" style="s2">want a better life</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:50.559" style="s2">like you know china example of china is</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.839" end="01:02:53.520" style="s2">demonstrates most vividly</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.559" end="01:02:55.359" style="s2">then i think uh certainly it is not easy</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.520" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">to persuade people suddenly to give up</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.359" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">mirage of urban living that has been so</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">dominant</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:05.280" style="s2">but yeah i mean it&#39;s certainly true that</p>

<p begin="01:04:41.599" end="01:04:45.760" style="s2">i took that document and brought it up</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:47.680" style="s2">to date a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.760" end="01:04:50.079" style="s2">i&#39;m saying basically you know it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.680" end="01:04:51.200" style="s2">about uh changes in direction in every</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.079" end="01:04:53.920" style="s2">possible way</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.200" end="01:04:55.200" style="s2">and i mean i&#39;ve kind of done a new</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.920" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">version of that for the club around</p>

<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:05:01.760" style="s2">and reframing economics so basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.839" end="01:05:03.440" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously all about circular</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.760" end="01:05:06.240" style="s2">systems it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.440" end="01:05:07.920" style="s2">it&#39;s about understanding you know better</p>

<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">acting on those and i certainly think</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.160" end="01:05:16.480" style="s2">you know that this kind of thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:18.000" style="s2">is there in many people&#39;s heads these</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.480" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">days but there&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.000" end="01:05:22.720" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:25.039" style="s2">between between realization and actual</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.720" end="01:05:26.640" style="s2">action to change and i think certainly</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.039" end="01:05:28.720" style="s2">it&#39;s above ourselves the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.640" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">financial systems i mean the willingness</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.720" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">of governments</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:34.880" style="s2">to take control of economies it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">really there at this moment in time</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.880" end="01:05:40.799" style="s2">i mean it goes back to the end of this</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:43.760" style="s2">cold war collapse of the soviet union</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.799" end="01:05:43.760" style="s2">when basically the</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:48.559" style="s2">world&#39;s governments were forced to</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">implement globalization because</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.559" end="01:05:53.119" style="s2">companies wanted that and particularly</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">financial institutions</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s really about power power systems</p>

<p begin="01:06:18.559" end="01:06:25.599" style="s2">you know ultimately the power systems</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:28.000" style="s2">that dominate what we do at the time</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.599" end="01:06:29.839" style="s2">unless they change fundamentally we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.000" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">not going to get the change in direction</p>

<p begin="01:08:31.679" end="01:08:38.319" style="s2">uh if we don&#39;t do this redesign</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:39.120" style="s2">we won&#39;t be silly to expect a different</p>

<p begin="01:08:39.120" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">but do you really think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.000" end="01:08:46.480" style="s2">moving towards some form of consensus of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:49.600" style="s2">how we could</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.480" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">i at least</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.600" end="01:08:53.600" style="s2">in theory and later than also in</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">practice create a system that</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:08:58.159" style="s2">um is regenerative by design in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:00.799" style="s2">the economic system</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.159" end="01:09:02.159" style="s2">like because they what what it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.799" end="01:09:03.679" style="s2">right now seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.159" end="01:09:05.440" style="s2">the case is that on the one hand the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.679" end="01:09:07.440" style="s2">people say</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.440" end="01:09:08.640" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible to be regenerative in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.440" end="01:09:10.080" style="s2">capitalist system</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.640" end="01:09:11.920" style="s2">actually there is something about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.080" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">ownership of the means of production and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:15.759" style="s2">the ownership of land that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:18.480" style="s2">fundamentally structured in such a way</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.759" end="01:09:20.880" style="s2">that that it creates this pyramid scheme</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">and then uh others who are more in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.880" end="01:09:24.239" style="s2">sort of strategic way saying well</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:25.679" style="s2">let&#39;s create regenerative capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.239" end="01:09:27.440" style="s2">because they want to keep</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.679" end="01:09:28.799" style="s2">the the arch capitalists and the current</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.440" end="01:09:31.839" style="s2">dogma on board</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.799" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">and i i can see that there&#39;s wisdom in</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.839" end="01:09:36.799" style="s2">both approaches</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:37.759" style="s2">like trying to um redesign capitalism to</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.799" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">the point that what</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.759" end="01:09:40.960" style="s2">what we end up with isn&#39;t capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">anymore but</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.960" end="01:09:44.319" style="s2">use the language of redesigning</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">capitalism in order to keep people on</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.319" end="01:09:47.359" style="s2">board</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.960" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">in the conversation about transformation</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.359" end="01:09:51.279" style="s2">where do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:55.040" style="s2">stand there um do you think we can save</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.279" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">capitalism or is it structurally</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.040" end="01:09:58.159" style="s2">dysfunctional well it&#39;s not going to go</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.360" end="01:10:00.000" style="s2">away that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.159" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the reality of it i mean all the</p>

<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">in the past have tried to get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.719" end="01:10:07.600" style="s2">well not all of them i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:11.199" style="s2">always been the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.600" end="01:10:14.080" style="s2">you know the uprising of of the</p>

<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">in in russia i mean basically in the end</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:38.560" style="s2">both of them are now said you know state</p>

<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">you know capitalism has researched and</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.719" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">both both of those large</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:46.320" style="s2">entities those huge countries sadly uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:49.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.320" end="01:10:50.880" style="s2">the reality is that i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.600" end="01:10:53.520" style="s2">interesting to look at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.880" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">history of socialism and karl marx for</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.520" end="01:10:57.040" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:10:58.239" style="s2">was very interested in the metabolism</p>

<p begin="01:10:58.239" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">realized that you know the concentration</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.840" end="01:11:06.239" style="s2">of power by</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:08.640" style="s2">by a few industrial industrialism</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.239" end="01:11:10.640" style="s2">and money money men if you like</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.640" end="01:11:12.480" style="s2">ultimately led to these conflicts</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.640" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">between humans and nature</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.480" end="01:11:15.840" style="s2">so he argued that we needed to</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:19.199" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.840" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">the relationship between in society and</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.199" end="01:11:23.760" style="s2">nature in new ways and</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">referred to that in the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.760" end="01:11:28.960" style="s2">metabolism of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:31.199" style="s2">societies but in the end</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.960" end="01:11:32.480" style="s2">we are seeing now you know that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.199" end="01:11:34.480" style="s2">dominance</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.480" end="01:11:36.080" style="s2">of existing power structures have not</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.480" end="01:11:38.880" style="s2">been broken</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.080" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">and so when it is great to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.880" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">new economics</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:46.800" style="s2">uh donald economics uh human faced</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">economic well-being economics is being</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.800" end="01:11:50.560" style="s2">done by many different people</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:52.480" style="s2">but we don&#39;t have the rights of power in</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.560" end="01:11:54.560" style="s2">our hands so i mean the</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.480" end="01:11:56.320" style="s2">the real hope that i have is that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.560" end="01:11:58.320" style="s2">pressure of young people</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.320" end="01:11:59.360" style="s2">kids telling their parents around the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.320" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">dinner table</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.360" end="01:12:04.560" style="s2">that they cannot accept that they will</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:07.679" style="s2">have to live in a world which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.560" end="01:12:10.719" style="s2">totally where that you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.679" end="01:12:13.760" style="s2">the indebtedness of young people to</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.719" end="01:12:14.960" style="s2">as a result of externalities not being</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.760" end="01:12:17.600" style="s2">internalized in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.960" end="01:12:18.560" style="s2">price of products and so on is is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.600" end="01:12:21.600" style="s2">given</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.560" end="01:12:23.280" style="s2">so i think you know the realization</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.600" end="01:12:26.400" style="s2">that we are on hiding to nothing with</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.280" end="01:12:26.400" style="s2">modern civilization</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.360" end="01:12:31.840" style="s2">in relationship to what we&#39;re doing to</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.440" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">nature that i think is the greatest hope</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.840" end="01:12:36.719" style="s2">that we now have</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">i really think that you know the fact</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.719" end="01:12:40.640" style="s2">that young people are</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">raising their voices so vividly and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.640" end="01:12:46.239" style="s2">clearly and so lively</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:48.239" style="s2">is where we can really put our sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.239" end="01:12:49.360" style="s2">you know put our hope more than anything</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.239" end="01:12:50.640" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.360" end="01:12:53.040" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s great to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.640" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">alternative economies</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.040" end="01:12:56.640" style="s2">coming up as concepts of the kind that</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve already talked about but</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.640" end="01:13:00.320" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:02.320" style="s2">unless there&#39;s a social pressure for</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.320" end="01:13:03.120" style="s2">that generation for that change to take</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:05.679" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.120" end="01:13:07.360" style="s2">then we are not going to get very far i</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.679" end="01:13:09.120" style="s2">mean the socialist revolutions are</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.360" end="01:13:12.159" style="s2">driven by by workers</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.120" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">and intellectuals but the</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.159" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">social movement today has not really had</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.520" end="01:13:20.239" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.880" end="01:13:22.560" style="s2">really major sort of power to generate</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.239" end="01:13:24.880" style="s2">change because there was no clear</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.560" end="01:13:26.719" style="s2">force for change that was visible</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.880" end="01:13:27.600" style="s2">whereas i think today with young people</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.719" end="01:13:30.400" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.600" end="01:13:31.600" style="s2">enough is enough we cannot accept that</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.400" end="01:13:34.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a future</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.600" end="01:13:37.520" style="s2">that to my mind is the greatest power</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.960" end="01:13:38.400" style="s2">that we can hope will come we can really</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.520" end="01:13:41.120" style="s2">generate</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.400" end="01:13:41.679" style="s2">change in the world and and where do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.120" end="01:13:46.400" style="s2">sit</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.679" end="01:13:49.040" style="s2">last question with regard to um</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.400" end="01:13:50.719" style="s2">that the transformation we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.040" end="01:13:54.159" style="s2">about and still hoping for</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.719" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">in the context of contrary evidence</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.159" end="01:13:58.000" style="s2">and then the hope of young generations</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">um maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.000" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">finally tipping the balance towards</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">towards real transformational change</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:05.840" style="s2">the i personally and i&#39;m just wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:08.320" style="s2">check</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.840" end="01:14:09.440" style="s2">against your your um decades of</p>

<p begin="01:14:09.440" end="01:14:14.480" style="s2">the the re-regionalization you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.320" end="01:14:15.440" style="s2">marks like kropotkin&#39;s mystical</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.480" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">anarchism</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.440" end="01:14:20.480" style="s2">sure basically an anarchism that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.560" end="01:14:22.159" style="s2">the what we now understand of anarchism</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.480" end="01:14:24.719" style="s2">which is there&#39;s no rule</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.159" end="01:14:26.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a radical subsidiarity that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.719" end="01:14:27.679" style="s2">coupled with a level of education and</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.800" end="01:14:31.600" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.679" end="01:14:35.040" style="s2">of the radical inter-being of life</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.600" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">that that would then make people without</p>

<p begin="01:14:46.080" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2">become subsidiary to the enablement</p>

<p begin="01:15:22.960" end="01:15:27.360" style="s2">um well that&#39;s certainly something that</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.360" end="01:15:29.120" style="s2">i mean working with john cena all those</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.360" end="01:15:31.840" style="s2">years ago of course that was our main</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.120" end="01:15:33.679" style="s2">issue our main concern you know local</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.840" end="01:15:36.159" style="s2">regional self-sufficiency</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.679" end="01:15:37.520" style="s2">self-reliance and so on but we still</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.159" end="01:15:38.640" style="s2">have a long way to go over that i mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.520" end="01:15:41.520" style="s2">just yesterday i was</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.640" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">watching a tv program on the bbc country</p>

<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:47.120" style="s2">and it showed how crops are currently</p>

<p begin="01:15:47.120" end="01:15:51.199" style="s2">and this in this particular incident was</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.600" end="01:15:54.480" style="s2">it was grass you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.199" end="01:15:57.120" style="s2">silage and you saw these vast tractors</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.480" end="01:15:58.880" style="s2">that could cut another more on each side</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.120" end="01:16:02.480" style="s2">than one at the front they could cut</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.880" end="01:16:04.800" style="s2">12 meter widths of of of grass right and</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.480" end="01:16:07.760" style="s2">then they had these incredible machines</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:09.040" style="s2">putting it all into uh into trainers and</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.760" end="01:16:11.040" style="s2">then ultimately into</p>

<p begin="01:16:36.239" end="01:16:39.280" style="s2">farmland on</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.679" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">around the village available to grow</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.280" end="01:16:42.960" style="s2">their crops and them to</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:44.239" style="s2">develop their their nice local</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.960" end="01:16:48.320" style="s2">lifestyles</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.239" end="01:16:49.120" style="s2">today villages in europe i completely</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.320" end="01:16:51.520" style="s2">detached from</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.120" end="01:16:52.960" style="s2">from the local countryside because</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.520" end="01:16:55.600" style="s2">farming and the village</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.960" end="01:16:57.199" style="s2">life no more i haven&#39;t got any direct</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.600" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">connections any longer</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:17:01.120" style="s2">so until you get to the point where</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.040" end="01:17:04.159" style="s2">people basically say okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:07.280" style="s2">we will reconnect the lifestyle of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.159" end="01:17:09.840" style="s2">of the region to the to the land even in</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.280" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">terms of how people participate</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.840" end="01:17:13.280" style="s2">in food production so then i think we</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:15.280" style="s2">are still</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.280" end="01:17:16.400" style="s2">you know living in a sort of illusion i</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.280" end="01:17:19.920" style="s2">mean basically</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.400" end="01:17:23.040" style="s2">you know in the f in the past you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.920" end="01:17:25.040" style="s2">20 30 of people used to farm the land</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.040" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">in britain today in europe today it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.040" end="01:17:29.920" style="s2">about less than one percent of people</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:31.199" style="s2">everybody who farms the land sits in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.920" end="01:17:33.920" style="s2">huge tractor</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.199" end="01:17:34.960" style="s2">has huge machinery available to them to</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.920" end="01:17:36.560" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.960" end="01:17:38.719" style="s2">you know farm three or four hundred five</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:39.199" style="s2">hundred acres and i mean when you look</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.719" end="01:17:41.600" style="s2">at that</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.199" end="01:17:42.480" style="s2">in in the amazon and and in some places</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.600" end="01:17:45.280" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.480" end="01:17:46.480" style="s2">today animal feeds are produced you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.280" end="01:17:48.560" style="s2">one farmer can</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.480" end="01:17:50.239" style="s2">farm five thousand acres you know with</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.560" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">these enormous machines</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.239" end="01:17:55.360" style="s2">so we have a problem in terms of how we</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.960" end="01:17:57.520" style="s2">are so amplified by technology</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.360" end="01:17:59.000" style="s2">that we are not able to simply say okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.520" end="01:18:01.120" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.000" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">relocalization of the kind that helena</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.120" end="01:18:05.199" style="s2">and albacore and others</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">have been talking about for for so long</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:08.880" style="s2">the reality is</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:10.719" style="s2">this contradiction between who we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.880" end="01:18:12.800" style="s2">become as human beings</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.719" end="01:18:15.040" style="s2">amplified through technology and how we</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.800" end="01:18:18.480" style="s2">can get back to a way of life</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.040" end="01:18:21.280" style="s2">that relates closely to where to to to</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.480" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">do the local countryside you know so</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.280" end="01:18:24.280" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:25.679" style="s2">it&#39;s great to have this concept of</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.280" end="01:18:27.679" style="s2">relocalization</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.679" end="01:18:29.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m very much part of that movement</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.679" end="01:18:32.480" style="s2">and i grow my own vegetables and</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.760" end="01:18:34.000" style="s2">i live you know on fire we get firewood</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.480" end="01:18:36.560" style="s2">from the forest and</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.000" end="01:18:38.239" style="s2">we have a close roasted community in our</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.560" end="01:18:39.760" style="s2">village we do festivals</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.239" end="01:18:41.679" style="s2">so that kind of stuff is beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.760" end="01:18:43.600" style="s2">happen again i mean the village</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.679" end="01:18:46.800" style="s2">carnivals village festivals</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.600" end="01:18:50.640" style="s2">with its sharing of uh of experiences</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.800" end="01:18:53.600" style="s2">village community life in various ways</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.640" end="01:18:54.000" style="s2">but when it comes to the actual economic</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.600" end="01:18:57.280" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.000" end="01:18:57.920" style="s2">of regions is still so totally dominated</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.280" end="01:19:00.159" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.920" end="01:19:01.199" style="s2">the opportunities inherent in modern</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.159" end="01:19:04.159" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.199" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">that there&#39;s this disconnect between a</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.159" end="01:19:07.440" style="s2">local community</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:08.880" style="s2">and its surrounding countryside and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.440" end="01:19:11.280" style="s2">i think until we</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.880" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">get get get to grips with that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.280" end="01:19:15.280" style="s2">gonna be hard</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:16.320" style="s2">to make relocalization of the kind that</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.280" end="01:19:19.199" style="s2">you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.320" end="01:19:19.679" style="s2">true reality yeah no i completely agree</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.199" end="01:19:23.199" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.679" end="01:19:24.719" style="s2">we could have a to just just talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.199" end="01:19:26.719" style="s2">the role of technology that would be</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.719" end="01:19:30.159" style="s2">fascinating because um</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.719" end="01:19:32.080" style="s2">i&#39;m like bucky fuller&#39;s famous quote</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.159" end="01:19:33.600" style="s2">um if you want to change the way people</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.080" end="01:19:36.480" style="s2">think don&#39;t tell them what to think</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.600" end="01:19:38.320" style="s2">give them a tool the use of which will</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.480" end="01:19:41.120" style="s2">change the way they think</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.320" end="01:19:42.719" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s the nice code yeah i used</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.120" end="01:19:43.840" style="s2">this quote a number of times in a number</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.719" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">of settings but only</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.840" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">in the last few months have i realized</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:50.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:52.000" style="s2">if you apply that quote to any</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.080" end="01:19:53.520" style="s2">technology from the printing press to</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.000" end="01:19:54.719" style="s2">the computers we&#39;re currently using to</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.520" end="01:19:58.400" style="s2">have this conversation to</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.719" end="01:20:02.239" style="s2">everything we use it it begins to really</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.400" end="01:20:04.560" style="s2">unpack how insidious</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.239" end="01:20:06.800" style="s2">technology actually pervades in all our</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.560" end="01:20:09.520" style="s2">lives and has affected how we think</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.800" end="01:20:11.440" style="s2">about how to create solutions how to</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.520" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">meet needs how to relate to people how</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.440" end="01:20:15.120" style="s2">to relate to the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.800" end="01:20:16.320" style="s2">and and i&#39;m i&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.120" end="01:20:19.840" style="s2">negative but</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.320" end="01:20:21.920" style="s2">we we seem to not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.840" end="01:20:23.280" style="s2">step back enough to really have an</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.920" end="01:20:24.560" style="s2">ethical conversation about what</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.280" end="01:20:27.679" style="s2">technology is</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.560" end="01:20:29.040" style="s2">to use when and how and particularly the</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.679" end="01:20:31.280" style="s2">systemic understanding</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.040" end="01:20:32.960" style="s2">of the side effects of it seemed like a</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.280" end="01:20:34.239" style="s2">good idea at the time to have a tractor</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.960" end="01:20:37.760" style="s2">that can</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.239" end="01:20:41.360" style="s2">take people away from the hard work of</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.760" end="01:20:45.040" style="s2">walking behind a animal that was pulling</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.360" end="01:20:46.560" style="s2">a basic plow but um</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.040" end="01:20:48.239" style="s2">we we don&#39;t think of all the side</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.560" end="01:20:48.639" style="s2">effects that come with the the use of</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.239" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.639" end="01:20:52.560" style="s2">these um technologies and but that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:54.719" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.560" end="01:20:55.840" style="s2">when i moved and my wife and i moved to</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.719" end="01:20:58.880" style="s2">our cottage</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.840" end="01:21:00.719" style="s2">uh 44 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.880" end="01:21:02.320" style="s2">and we bought a little tractor in order</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.719" end="01:21:05.280" style="s2">to farm you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.320" end="01:21:07.760" style="s2">make hay and all the rest of it um plow</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.280" end="01:21:10.239" style="s2">some fields and so on um</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.760" end="01:21:11.679" style="s2">that was a 20 horsepower tractor and</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.239" end="01:21:13.760" style="s2">then those days that was</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.679" end="01:21:15.520" style="s2">you know a small practice at the time</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.760" end="01:21:17.920" style="s2">but typically that time</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.520" end="01:21:18.639" style="s2">you had 40 40 horsepower tractors as the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.920" end="01:21:22.239" style="s2">norm</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.639" end="01:21:24.239" style="s2">today 200 300 horsepower yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.239" end="01:21:25.840" style="s2">and that means far far less people</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.239" end="01:21:29.199" style="s2">working the land even than</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.840" end="01:21:31.920" style="s2">they did 40 years ago localization is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.199" end="01:21:35.280" style="s2">wonderful concept and i mean i really</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.920" end="01:21:36.560" style="s2">you know admire the vigor in which this</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.280" end="01:21:39.199" style="s2">is being pursued by</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.560" end="01:21:41.040" style="s2">so many people including yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.199" end="01:21:43.199" style="s2">i&#39;ve written about it and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.040" end="01:21:44.800" style="s2">you know that way of life is much more</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.199" end="01:21:46.480" style="s2">local than it would have been</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.800" end="01:21:48.800" style="s2">while we were living in london all those</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.480" end="01:21:52.239" style="s2">years ago but certainly</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.800" end="01:21:54.639" style="s2">aspects of local life are reviving</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.239" end="01:21:56.000" style="s2">very actively no no doubt about it but</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.639" end="01:21:58.320" style="s2">by and large unless we get</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.000" end="01:22:00.000" style="s2">to grips with the economics of it as</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.320" end="01:22:03.360" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.000" end="01:22:05.679" style="s2">the culture to to fit the bill and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.360" end="01:22:08.560" style="s2">way that we would like to</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.679" end="01:22:10.719" style="s2">well i think we&#39;ve had a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.560" end="01:22:12.960" style="s2">wide-ranging conversation really</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.719" end="01:22:14.400" style="s2">appreciate your time and and love to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.960" end="01:22:14.880" style="s2">this again it&#39;s great to be in touch and</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.400" end="01:22:16.880" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.880" end="01:22:18.480" style="s2">what what are you doing now in you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.880" end="01:22:20.400" style="s2">in majorca you told me that you were</p>

<p begin="01:23:12.000" end="01:23:16.320" style="s2">and um and local landowners around the</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.400" end="01:23:19.760" style="s2">island and and that will</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.320" end="01:23:22.000" style="s2">begin the conversation around what does</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.760" end="01:23:24.080" style="s2">bioregional regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.000" end="01:23:26.000" style="s2">at island scale look like and we have</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.080" end="01:23:29.120" style="s2">this wonderful opportunity to do it</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.000" end="01:23:31.199" style="s2">both marine regeneration with the</p>

<p begin="01:23:33.199" end="01:23:38.400" style="s2">and of course the opportunity and the</p>

<p begin="01:23:38.400" end="01:23:41.840" style="s2">with the major local economy having</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.719" end="01:23:44.159" style="s2">collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.840" end="01:23:46.840" style="s2">and people not quite willing yet to</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.159" end="01:23:49.679" style="s2">admit to what extent it has collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.840" end="01:23:50.560" style="s2">semi-permanently or will not bounce back</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.679" end="01:23:53.760" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.560" end="01:23:55.199" style="s2">the unsustainable and and before levels</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.760" end="01:23:58.639" style="s2">that it was before</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.199" end="01:24:01.440" style="s2">um i think major is</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.639" end="01:24:03.280" style="s2">in for three four really difficult years</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.440" end="01:24:06.560" style="s2">and where they have to let go</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.280" end="01:24:08.400" style="s2">of um previous givens</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.560" end="01:24:10.159" style="s2">and assumptions that that will never</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.400" end="01:24:12.960" style="s2">change but but it</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.159" end="01:24:14.080" style="s2">that i see a huge potential um for for</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.960" end="01:24:17.520" style="s2">people being open</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.080" end="01:24:21.600" style="s2">to um</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.520" end="01:24:24.159" style="s2">rethink the future and rethink</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.600" end="01:24:26.159" style="s2">the whole island and the islands as</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.159" end="01:24:27.199" style="s2">potential models for exactly the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.159" end="01:24:29.360" style="s2">conversations that</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.199" end="01:24:30.760" style="s2">that we were just having like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.360" end="01:24:32.880" style="s2">create alternative models of</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.760" end="01:24:34.480" style="s2">regionalization and to what extent and</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.880" end="01:24:37.600" style="s2">what is actually possible</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.480" end="01:24:40.639" style="s2">and um islands are great examples of</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.600" end="01:24:42.320" style="s2">of by regional um yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.639" end="01:24:43.840" style="s2">and what about renewables i mean are you</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.320" end="01:24:45.920" style="s2">getting you know is</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.840" end="01:24:47.840" style="s2">my getting serious about powering itself</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.920" end="01:24:48.639" style="s2">renewable finally there&#39;s been a little</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.840" end="01:24:50.800" style="s2">bit of a shift</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.639" end="01:24:52.480" style="s2">just in the last few months as part of</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.800" end="01:24:55.520" style="s2">the the corvette response they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.480" end="01:24:59.440" style="s2">they&#39;ve flagged up that they will agree</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.520" end="01:25:02.400" style="s2">50 new solar parks around um</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.440" end="01:25:03.120" style="s2">okay what about wind wind has always</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.400" end="01:25:06.320" style="s2">been an</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.120" end="01:25:06.880" style="s2">issue because of the the local bird</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:09.920" style="s2">watching</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.880" end="01:25:11.199" style="s2">organization is also very strongly</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.920" end="01:25:12.960" style="s2">involved in</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.199" end="01:25:15.040" style="s2">protecting the environment in general</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.960" end="01:25:18.560" style="s2">and and they have</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.040" end="01:25:20.239" style="s2">bought into this this um unfounded</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.560" end="01:25:24.080" style="s2">belief that windmills</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.239" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">um kind of uh are bad for bird life</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.080" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">and i mean the reality</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.920" end="01:25:33.840" style="s2">um it&#39;s so far not in conversation</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.159" end="01:25:35.520" style="s2">um because you know i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.840" end="01:25:38.800" style="s2">deep the sea is but you know there are</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.520" end="01:25:40.239" style="s2">now these floating turbines you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.800" end="01:25:41.840" style="s2">i there&#39;s plenty there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.239" end="01:25:44.159" style="s2">opportunities for renewables around the</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.840" end="01:25:45.760" style="s2">balearics um</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.159" end="01:25:47.520" style="s2">to my mind it would have to be a really</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.760" end="01:25:50.080" style="s2">diverse um</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.520" end="01:25:51.199" style="s2">and and more rather than creating large</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.080" end="01:25:54.159" style="s2">wind farms</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.199" end="01:25:55.199" style="s2">and create decentralized diverse systems</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.159" end="01:25:57.760" style="s2">of both solar</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.199" end="01:25:58.480" style="s2">and solar thermal spain has has the</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.760" end="01:26:02.080" style="s2">highest</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.480" end="01:26:03.920" style="s2">um like one of the the best</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.080" end="01:26:05.920" style="s2">solar thermal power plant companies in</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.920" end="01:26:08.000" style="s2">the world um</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.920" end="01:26:09.040" style="s2">is from sevilla in southern spain so we</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.000" end="01:26:11.840" style="s2">we we could</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.040" end="01:26:13.120" style="s2">use concentrated solar thermal to</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.840" end="01:26:15.920" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.120" end="01:26:17.840" style="s2">some of the power plants we&#39;ve got so</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.920" end="01:26:19.440" style="s2">the short answer is i still have you in</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.840" end="01:26:22.560" style="s2">the back of my mind</p>
