<p begin="00:00:00.890" end="00:00:05.400" style="s2">hi there I want to introduce you to</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.810" end="00:00:06.270" style="s2">something called the glass bead game</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.400" end="00:00:08.700" style="s2">which is something I&#39;ve been playing</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.270" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">quite a lot of recently it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.700" end="00:00:13.889" style="s2">generating ideas in a sort of playful</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:15.420" style="s2">way in a sort of game space and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.889" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">just very briefly explain it in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.420" end="00:00:19.560" style="s2">video here and then as I play games I</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">will start posting them in a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.560" end="00:00:23.850" style="s2">playlist on the channel and yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">watch them if you think they&#39;re fun and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.850" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">my hope is that people will pick on and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:30.109" style="s2">pick up on it and start playing their</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.840" end="00:00:32.309" style="s2">own glass bead games all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.109" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s a really good way</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.309" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">of starting off a conversation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.059" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">a really good way of generating you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">a creative intelligence kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">it goes something like this</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">you can play with as many players as you</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:48.120" style="s2">want you can play at any format you want</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:50.969" style="s2">it can be in writing by video by phone</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.120" end="00:00:53.699" style="s2">it can be by voice message it can pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.969" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">much anything at all the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.699" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">you choose a topic to start with and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">then the first player takes their turn</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">and so that can be right a hundred words</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:05.150" style="s2">or talk for one minute or make a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">three-minute video or whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.150" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">just to keep it simple I&#39;ll imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:14.760" style="s2">two-player game on video like this right</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">and so let&#39;s say that we agree at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.760" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">start of the game we&#39;re gonna play a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">10-minute game so five one-minute turns</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">each in sequence I start and we pick the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">topic of father and so I will speak for</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:29.159" style="s2">one minute on anything that comes to my</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">mind related to father the idea is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.159" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">to rely too much on preconceived notions</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">right but just just just say whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">comes to mind let it flow freely one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">the not really a rule but it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:45.570" style="s2">you try to avoid talking from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">ego and so the personal pronouns i and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.570" end="00:01:49.140" style="s2">you are avoided as much as possible as</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:50.810" style="s2">if it&#39;s a it&#39;s not the end of the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.140" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">right but but but to try and avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.810" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">idea being that you can then open up to</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">a larger space than just your own self</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:04.110" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s the point of it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">yeah I speak for one minute I fill the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.110" end="00:02:09.960" style="s2">one minute and I stop and then you take</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">over for one minute and you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.960" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">been listening very intently and very</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:16.140" style="s2">carefully to what I&#39;ve been saying and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:17.820" style="s2">whatever comes up for you while I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.140" end="00:02:20.130" style="s2">been speaking is what you try and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.820" end="00:02:22.110" style="s2">articulate if nothing comes up then</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.130" end="00:02:23.850" style="s2">you&#39;re free to sit in silence or just</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.110" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">raise something of your own that has</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.850" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">nothing to do with anything I said but</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:30.060" style="s2">is on your mind you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">no hard and fast rules here it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.060" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">being present to what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">moment and to what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">yourself and being responsive to what</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:42.270" style="s2">the other is saying and trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">an interactive free-flowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.270" end="00:02:46.770" style="s2">idea space that&#39;s that&#39;s the notion and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:48.360" style="s2">so backwards and forwards five tones</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.770" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">each at the end of ten minutes you stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.360" end="00:02:53.340" style="s2">and then if you wish to continue the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:54.870" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s a really good starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.340" end="00:02:56.280" style="s2">point right because ideas have come up</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.870" end="00:02:57.630" style="s2">and then you think oh god I really want</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.280" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">to explore that a little bit further and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.630" end="00:03:02.040" style="s2">so it can be really excellent starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:03.270" style="s2">point for a conversation expanding it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.040" end="00:03:06.140" style="s2">out a little bit if you&#39;ve got a group</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.270" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">say ten people and again again there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.140" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">myriad number of ways you can play</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:11.850" style="s2">around with this but if you&#39;ve got ten</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:13.800" style="s2">people you could say split up into five</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.850" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">groups or to all discuss the same topic</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.800" end="00:03:17.250" style="s2">come back into a group of ten and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.450" end="00:03:19.530" style="s2">have a group discussion where you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.250" end="00:03:21.900" style="s2">exchange the ideas that came up in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.530" end="00:03:25.050" style="s2">little groups of two with each other so</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.900" end="00:03:27.110" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a really fantastic starting</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.050" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">point for having interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.110" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">illuminating and sometimes really</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:34.050" style="s2">groundbreaking discussions where I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:36.900" style="s2">do wow I had never thought of it in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.050" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">way before that&#39;s really like you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.900" end="00:03:41.730" style="s2">opened up a whole new room of thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:43.020" style="s2">for me so and that happens quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">that happens quite a lot it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.020" end="00:03:48.450" style="s2">engaging really stimulating really fun</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">and really challenging so yeah I highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.450" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">recommend it and like I said I will post</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:55.590" style="s2">some example games and in this playlist</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:56.910" style="s2">following on from this video so as</p>
