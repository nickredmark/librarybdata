<p begin="00:00:02.159" end="00:00:07.740" style="s2">they have to be sensitive to patterns</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.220" end="00:00:09.420" style="s2">that need an explanation most patterns</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.740" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">don&#39;t need science because why they</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.420" end="00:00:14.910" style="s2">happen is totally obvious so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:18.930" style="s2">be able to spot things for which the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.910" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">explanation is not obvious and you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.930" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">to be able to fill in the gap of what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:27.510" style="s2">not clear with something that could in</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">principle be correct whether it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.510" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">correct or it&#39;s not it could answer the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">question and that process of how you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:35.809" style="s2">generate hypotheses is actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">the hardest things to teach students</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.809" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">because it is a fundamentally creative</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.250" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">process it&#39;s not a science it&#39;s an art</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s an art that a if each of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:52.500" style="s2">us who does it described our method it</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound very scientific all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.500" end="00:00:57.660" style="s2">you know how do you bring yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">imagine a possible explanation for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.660" end="00:01:02.190" style="s2">phenomenon that nobody knows the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:04.040" style="s2">explanation to you know ideas a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.190" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">a fantasy realm and it doesn&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.040" end="00:01:09.780" style="s2">rigorous and you know it isn&#39;t rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">it&#39;s guesswork and intuition and all</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.780" end="00:01:13.250" style="s2">sorts of things that scientists pretend</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:17.130" style="s2">are not an important part of the process</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.250" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">but nonetheless if you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">good at science you have to be good at</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">this process and you have to give</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:28.460" style="s2">yourself license for that creative</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">endeavor and so Heather and I both</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.460" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">discovered time and time again that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">was very straightforward to teach</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">students most of the process involved in</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">science but getting students to phrase a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:44.430" style="s2">question you know to see something to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:46.829" style="s2">phrase a question about it and then to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.430" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">propose a hypothesis that could in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.829" end="00:01:51.560" style="s2">principle account for what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:54.899" style="s2">they&#39;ve observed it&#39;s a very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.560" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">method to teach and really you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.899" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">really teach it what you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.960" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">alert students to the fact that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">need to find their own process for it</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">and that they have license to I mean how</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:10.710" style="s2">many wrong hypotheses do you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">that before you hit on one that actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.710" end="00:02:15.570" style="s2">has the potential to be right tends to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:18.030" style="s2">be quite a number and so you you need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.570" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">give students license to think a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.030" end="00:02:21.570" style="s2">of wrong things and to feel good about</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:25.320" style="s2">it in order for them to get to something</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.570" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">that might be right but we&#39;re not easily</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.320" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">taught and frankly I don&#39;t even remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:33.330" style="s2">it being described anywhere in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:36.750" style="s2">education how you come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.330" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">hypothesis I don&#39;t remember anybody ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.750" end="00:02:44.820" style="s2">explaining that to me at all huh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s one of those black box well</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.820" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">it&#39;s black boxes</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:51.300" style="s2">yeah it is I guess that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">catch-all but maybe that&#39;s why I use the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.300" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">word part because that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">catch-all term for anything that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:57.960" style="s2">like well it&#39;s another science because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:01.860" style="s2">can&#39;t describe it but I know it when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.960" end="00:03:03.870" style="s2">see it well yeah I guess you know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.860" end="00:03:05.970" style="s2">does it mean for it to be an art is an</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.870" end="00:03:10.470" style="s2">interesting question I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:12.060" style="s2">lots of skills I think here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.470" end="00:03:14.150" style="s2">problem that was saying that it&#39;s an art</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.060" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">and it shouldn&#39;t be a problem that it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.150" end="00:03:19.320" style="s2">that there is a corner of art at which</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:22.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve come to a level of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.320" end="00:03:26.700" style="s2">that whether something is good art or</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.710" end="00:03:30.150" style="s2">bad art is completely an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.700" end="00:03:30.930" style="s2">question it&#39;s entirely subjective that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.150" end="00:03:33.270" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.930" end="00:03:36.360" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about a painter who is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.270" end="00:03:37.290" style="s2">depicting something in front of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.360" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.290" end="00:03:41.400" style="s2">how well does the painter depicted is</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:44.160" style="s2">actually a question it&#39;s not totally</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.400" end="00:03:45.690" style="s2">objective but they could depict it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.160" end="00:03:47.070" style="s2">poorly that nobody can tell what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.690" end="00:03:48.540" style="s2">the picture or they could depict it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.070" end="00:03:50.280" style="s2">well that you couldn&#39;t possibly mistake</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">what&#39;s in the picture or they could do</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.280" end="00:03:55.050" style="s2">something really amazing like a sure who</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:56.580" style="s2">depict something that can&#39;t be and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.050" end="00:03:59.010" style="s2">your brain is hung up trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.580" end="00:04:02.670" style="s2">out where the picture is inconsistent</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.010" end="00:04:05.070" style="s2">but in some sense when we say something</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.670" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">is an art we are not talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.070" end="00:04:11.030" style="s2">realm in which everything is subjective</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:18.170" style="s2">what an art is is something in which the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.030" end="00:04:20.370" style="s2">method is not fully explicit and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.170" end="00:04:23.580" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of parts of science in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.370" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">which we can say what the method is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:27.740" style="s2">part of science in which we can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">what the method is is a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.740" end="00:04:33.660" style="s2">throwing a frisbee if I say throwing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:35.100" style="s2">frisbee is an art there&#39;s physics to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.660" end="00:04:37.910" style="s2">making a frisbee do what you want it to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.100" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">do most of us who throw a frisbee well</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.910" end="00:04:42.360" style="s2">couldn&#39;t describe the physics and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">fact it&#39;s a little bit surprising when</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.360" end="00:04:46.050" style="s2">you try because it&#39;s inconsistent you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:47.760" style="s2">know the physics of throwing a ball it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.050" end="00:04:50.640" style="s2">much easier to understand in the physics</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.760" end="00:04:53.610" style="s2">of the way a frisbee arcs you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.640" end="00:04:55.980" style="s2">through its trajectory even but if he</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.610" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">tried to describe throwing a frisbee</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.980" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">while you&#39;re throwing a frisbee you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:02.220" style="s2">gonna up that frisbee throw yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">yeah you will because the part of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.220" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">mind that throws the frisbee isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:08.370" style="s2">part of your mind that explicitly knows</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.090" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">physics it&#39;s some other part of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.370" end="00:05:12.450" style="s2">mind that knows something that it would</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">be fair to call an art you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.450" end="00:05:17.100" style="s2">watch people play Ultimate Frisbee you</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.330" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">know a really good player who knows how</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.100" end="00:05:21.630" style="s2">to art the disc you know maybe even out</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:23.100" style="s2">of bounds so that it comes back in right</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.630" end="00:05:25.380" style="s2">at the place for the player that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.100" end="00:05:29.490" style="s2">see running is going to end up it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.380" end="00:05:31.560" style="s2">artistic right which is not to say the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.490" end="00:05:34.610" style="s2">haphazard or subjective or you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.560" end="00:05:38.480" style="s2">finding a solution that has a air of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.610" end="00:05:42.060" style="s2">unexpectedness of it it&#39;s a skill that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.480" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t explicit yeah an art is a skill</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.060" end="00:05:47.880" style="s2">that isn&#39;t explicit and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2">uncomfortable thing for us analytical</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.880" end="00:05:51.540" style="s2">types I think is acknowledging how much</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:55.860" style="s2">of things that we claim are explicit</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.540" end="00:05:58.470" style="s2">really aren&#39;t you know your surgeon can</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.860" end="00:06:00.870" style="s2">say an awful lot about what they do but</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.470" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">your surgeon also has a feel for stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.870" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">that they don&#39;t even know how to they</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:06.390" style="s2">don&#39;t explain it to themselves they they</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:08.060" style="s2">Intuit it when they get there and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.390" end="00:06:10.260" style="s2">know searching with a good intuition</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.060" end="00:06:12.480" style="s2">versus well it&#39;s not so hot</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.260" end="00:06:13.890" style="s2">intuition you want the one with the good</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.480" end="00:06:15.780" style="s2">intuition even if what they know</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.890" end="00:06:20.190" style="s2">explicitly explicitly is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.780" end="00:06:22.110" style="s2">same so I think those things that exist</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.190" end="00:06:24.870" style="s2">in a realm where things are explicit</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.110" end="00:06:27.000" style="s2">that fraction of an explicit realm that</p>
