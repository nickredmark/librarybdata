<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.780" style="s2">hey folks read here it has been an</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.310" end="00:00:06.359" style="s2">incredibly interesting week</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.780" end="00:00:08.630" style="s2">last Wednesday Dave Rubin invited me to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.359" end="00:00:12.900" style="s2">join him onstage in Bellevue Washington</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.630" end="00:00:15.809" style="s2">for a comedy in questions event which</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.900" end="00:00:17.910" style="s2">was quite extraordinary the following</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.809" end="00:00:20.119" style="s2">night I attended the Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.910" end="00:00:24.480" style="s2">lecture in Seattle in preparation for</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.119" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">the debates last weekend in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.480" end="00:00:28.890" style="s2">between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">which I had the privilege of moderating</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.890" end="00:00:34.170" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely something going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:36.660" style="s2">all of the audiences in these various</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.170" end="00:00:39.000" style="s2">venues were utterly enthusiastic and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.660" end="00:00:42.540" style="s2">they appeared to be enthusiastic about</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">the breakdown of the tired sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.540" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">apparatus that we&#39;ve all been stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">for so long and its replacement by</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:51.090" style="s2">something new interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.899" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">unpredictable if you haven&#39;t been to one</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.090" end="00:00:54.899" style="s2">of these live events I highly recommend</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">it I think you will discover something</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.899" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">very exciting as a foot if you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">to one of these live events and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">even if you can I would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">looking into the Rubin report with Eric</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.409" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">Weinstein ben shapiro and jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">peterson and one prior to that with</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:14.460" style="s2">jordan peterson and eric weinstein both</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">of those discussions are of quite a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">sort I think we&#39;re really breaking new</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">ground and lots of positions that have</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">previously been thought to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">unreconciled both are beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:24.930" style="s2">converge on some kind of new</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:26.759" style="s2">reasonableness</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.930" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">it&#39;s very hopeful now I want to say a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.759" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">few words about the debates in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:34.590" style="s2">I chose at the beginning of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">evenings to ask the audience not to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.590" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">livestream or record the events and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">appears that nobody did on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">that no video has emerged so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">for listening to me and taking that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:52.470" style="s2">request seriously I do have some concern</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">now that the videos that were taken</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.470" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">officially of those events are not going</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.360" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">to emerge for quite some time and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">creates a problem let me say a few words</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">about why I made the request to begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">with my thought having seen several of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">these events of different kinds now is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:12.750" style="s2">that there&#39;s a palpable difference</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">between those events that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:17.670" style="s2">immediately brought to the Internet and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:20.220" style="s2">events in which the room in which the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.670" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">event takes place is isolated from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.220" end="00:02:25.080" style="s2">internet for some period of time I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:27.690" style="s2">wasn&#39;t sure exactly why the difference</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.080" end="00:02:29.520" style="s2">existed my thought was that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.690" end="00:02:32.220" style="s2">participants are a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.520" end="00:02:34.020" style="s2">relaxed about what they say in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.220" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">context of a room that is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.020" end="00:02:38.310" style="s2">immediately being broadcast to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">outside world in the aftermath of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.310" end="00:02:41.580" style="s2">vancouver debates i&#39;ve changed my mind a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:44.940" style="s2">little bit about why the difference</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.580" end="00:02:47.850" style="s2">exists my feeling now is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.940" end="00:02:51.630" style="s2">necessity for the room to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.850" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">decide what it saw before the internet</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.630" end="00:02:56.850" style="s2">weighs in and when an event is broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:59.730" style="s2">it when it is streamed or when it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.850" end="00:03:02.820" style="s2">immediately released there&#39;s a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:04.230" style="s2">for the internet reaction to overwhelm</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.820" end="00:03:05.820" style="s2">the reaction of the room and it can</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:08.720" style="s2">actually override it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.820" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">so I do think it&#39;s a good idea for</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">events especially ones that are likely</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">to change the nature of the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">like a debate between sam harris and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:20.370" style="s2">jordan peterson where progress is made</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:22.650" style="s2">and things are different at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.370" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">the evening than they were before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.650" end="00:03:26.700" style="s2">very important for those events I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">to be insulated from the internet for</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.700" end="00:03:31.049" style="s2">long enough for the room to come to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:32.700" style="s2">conclusion about what it saw before it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.049" end="00:03:35.610" style="s2">gets overwhelmed by the outside</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.700" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">I don&#39;t think however that it&#39;s healthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.610" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2">to have a very long delay in such a case</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:43.170" style="s2">I&#39;m particularly concerned that jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:45.930" style="s2">peterson and sam harris are going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.170" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">meet again very soon in dublin and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.930" end="00:03:49.049" style="s2">london and they will of course be</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">meeting from the position that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.049" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">arrived at at the end of their vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">meeting but their audience is now</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:58.530" style="s2">divided there are those people who were</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">in vancouver and are up-to-date on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.530" end="00:04:02.370" style="s2">change in their understanding of each</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:05.220" style="s2">other and then there&#39;s the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.370" end="00:04:07.950" style="s2">the audience which wasn&#39;t in vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.220" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">and hasn&#39;t been able to grapple with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.950" end="00:04:13.980" style="s2">change in both men&#39;s positions i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">that poses a danger that it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.980" end="00:04:20.340" style="s2">bit hard to describe but it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:24.030" style="s2">that the audience failing to update its</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.340" end="00:04:26.220" style="s2">model of where the two positions that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.030" end="00:04:29.850" style="s2">these men hold are at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.220" end="00:04:31.890" style="s2">will cause them to regress and that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.850" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">progress that they made which I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.890" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">was very substantial may also be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:39.630" style="s2">little bit fragile so we&#39;re at mine to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.020" end="00:04:42.810" style="s2">decide I would have those tapes released</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.630" end="00:04:45.660" style="s2">so that the internet could view them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.810" end="00:04:48.470" style="s2">come to understand them before Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.660" end="00:04:50.850" style="s2">and Sam meet in Dublin and in London I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.470" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.850" end="00:04:56.700" style="s2">so I feel I owe an apology to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:04:58.740" style="s2">audience for making the request I did</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.700" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">had I known that it might be a very long</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.740" end="00:05:02.700" style="s2">time before the tapes were going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:06.450" style="s2">emerge I would not have made that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.700" end="00:05:09.450" style="s2">request so I would also ask something of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.450" end="00:05:13.770" style="s2">the audience which is give Sam and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.450" end="00:05:16.440" style="s2">Jordan room to let you know in their own</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.770" end="00:05:20.460" style="s2">way the ways in which their perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.440" end="00:05:22.410" style="s2">have been modified I saw today on reddit</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.460" end="00:05:25.380" style="s2">that somebody had posted a quote from</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.410" end="00:05:27.890" style="s2">Sam from I don&#39;t know how long ago but</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.380" end="00:05:30.600" style="s2">it was clearly a very harsh judgment of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.890" end="00:05:32.700" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s perspective and I know</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.600" end="00:05:35.250" style="s2">it does not fit with his current</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.700" end="00:05:39.570" style="s2">understanding it&#39;s one example of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.250" end="00:05:42.060" style="s2">kind of of tension that could pull one</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.570" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">or both of these people backwards so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.060" end="00:05:48.360" style="s2">please resist the urge to pull them and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:50.460" style="s2">I hope that they will find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.360" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">bring their London and Dublin audiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.460" end="00:05:55.020" style="s2">up to speed as quickly as possible those</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:56.850" style="s2">events in London and Dublin are going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.020" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">be quite different than the Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.850" end="00:06:01.500" style="s2">events for one thing they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:04.410" style="s2">moderated they will be joined by Douglas</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.500" end="00:06:06.120" style="s2">Murray who is a wonderful human being in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.410" end="00:06:08.760" style="s2">his own right I met him several weeks</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.120" end="00:06:11.160" style="s2">ago and I think they are sure to have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.760" end="00:06:12.419" style="s2">fascinating discussion but it will not</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.160" end="00:06:15.270" style="s2">be a discussion in which there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.419" end="00:06:19.380" style="s2">somebody whose purpose is to help them</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.270" end="00:06:23.070" style="s2">not talk past each other in any case I</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.380" end="00:06:25.580" style="s2">do hope that the momentum that has taken</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.070" end="00:06:29.340" style="s2">over this movement if that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.580" end="00:06:31.560" style="s2">continues and that we will find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.340" end="00:06:34.680" style="s2">continue to level up so we can keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.560" end="00:06:37.200" style="s2">discovering greater nuance that will</p>
