<p begin="00:00:30.980" end="00:00:33.340" style="s2">One of the </p>
<p begin="00:00:33.350" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">fundamental theses of this course is that<br />in, in modern literature, and in literature</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.449" end="00:00:47.250" style="s2">that isn’t so modern, there’s the notion<br />of a human-created monster, Frankenstein,</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:52.250" style="s2">right, springs to mind, and at an adequate<br />time, I mean, Frankenstein was a, a fantasy,</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.250" end="00:00:58.820" style="s2">an unconscious fantasy, a dream in, in actuality,<br />about the potential dangers of unbridled technological</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.820" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">advancement, right, Why is that? Well maybe<br />it’s something like this, and, and this</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.330" end="00:01:17.330" style="s2">is certainly a, a notion that Jung would agree<br />with, if we don’t develop a moral sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:25.810" style="s2">as conscious and as elaborated as our technological<br />sense, the fact that we’re increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.810" end="00:01:29.740" style="s2">capable of becoming increasingly powerful<br />will necessarily do us in, right.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.740" end="00:01:36.740" style="s2">The bigger your weapons, the smarter you better<br />be to control them, and so maybe it is something</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.189" end="00:01:44.569" style="s2">like this, maybe, and this is a strict Jungian<br />notion, maybe five hundred years ago when</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.569" end="00:01:51.139" style="s2">we started to ratchet up the rate at which<br />we were developing our technological expertise,</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.139" end="00:01:58.139" style="s2">and left our mythological and religious presuppositions<br />and conceptions behind as archaic and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.539" end="00:02:05.109" style="s2">as predicated on superstition , maybe we need<br />to spend as much time updating them and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.109" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">them into the domain of clear consciousness<br />and control as we have spent on developing</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:16.280" style="s2">our technological sense.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.280" end="00:02:20.620" style="s2">If you were a medieval Christian or an archaic<br />religious thinker of any sort, your first</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.620" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">presupposition was that the world and the<br />cosmos existed exactly as they appeared,</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:31.080" style="s2">which with you or at least your village or<br />town or country at the center, and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.080" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">with the earth at the center, and with the<br />cosmos as a shield around the earth, and with</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:41.000" style="s2">the earth itself as the domain of man being<br />a fundamental attribute of the cosmos.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.000" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">So this is a quotation from Jung, and it’s<br />one I like a lot because I think it adequately</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:56.739" style="s2">and succinctly describes the distinction between<br />the way that modern people think, and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.739" end="00:03:02.140" style="s2">way that people think if they’re still ensconced<br />within a traditional belief form, How totally,</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.140" end="00:03:07.430" style="s2">different, did the world appear to medieval<br />man. For him the earth was eternally fixed</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.430" end="00:03:12.750" style="s2">and it rest in the center of the universe<br />encircled by the course of a sun that solicitously</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:14.599" style="s2">bestowed its warmth,</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.599" end="00:03:19.909" style="s2">Despite the fact that pre-empirical people<br />had to deal with death and disease on a scale</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.909" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">that I think is completely unknown to us,<br />it doesn’t seem unreasonable to presuppose</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:24.610" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.610" end="00:03:28.189" style="s2">there was a certain degree of comfort to be<br />found in a worldview of this sort,</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.189" end="00:03:32.450" style="s2">right, because it appeared at least to the<br />casual observer that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.450" end="00:03:36.260" style="s2">the cosmos was human centric,</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.260" end="00:03:42.500" style="s2">and that the notion that human purpose was<br />in some way associated with cosmic significance,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.500" end="00:03:47.909" style="s2">seemed to be beyond question, at least in<br />part because there were no theories of reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.909" end="00:03:51.219" style="s2">that would compete with that initial preconception.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.219" end="00:03:55.439" style="s2">Men were all children of God unto the loving<br />care of the most High, who prepared them for</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.439" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">eternal blessedness, and all knew exactly<br />what they should do and how they should conduct</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:06.680" style="s2">themselves in order to rise from a corruptible<br />world to an incorruptible and joyous existence.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:13.170" style="s2">Such a life no longer seems real to us, even<br />in our dreams. Natural science has long ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:16.140" style="s2">torn this lovely veil to shreds.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.140" end="00:04:18.519" style="s2">how is it that people could think that way</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.519" end="00:04:21.549" style="s2">given that it was so wrong and still survive?</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.549" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">Given that in large part we are necessarily<br />creatures of tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:33.130" style="s2">How is it that we can sever the ties with<br />the manner in which our ancestors thought,</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.190" end="00:04:38.030" style="s2">and suffer no ill consequences in result?</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.030" end="00:04:41.970" style="s2">People think automatically, and, and I think<br />for good reasons, that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.970" end="00:04:47.900" style="s2">the march of human thought has been unbroken<br />progress towards increased rationality,</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.900" end="00:04:52.150" style="s2">increased power, increased clarity, but it’s<br />certainly the case that as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.150" end="00:04:54.190" style="s2">sacrifice of our religious beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.190" end="00:04:58.990" style="s2">and our philosophical beliefs that problems<br />of meaning have become more paramount for</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.990" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">the modern person.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:03.319" style="s2">And then you might ask, well what exactly<br />are the consequences of that,</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.319" end="00:05:09.250" style="s2">and I think initially the best perspective<br />to take is one that’s historical.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.250" end="00:05:16.250" style="s2">As we’ve moved away from a classical, mystical<br />or mythological worldview,</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.520" end="00:05:20.539" style="s2">a number of dramatic occurrences have unfolded,</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.539" end="00:05:24.190" style="s2">we’ve become much more technologically powerful,<br />right.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.190" end="00:05:29.180" style="s2">The application of a strict empirical model<br />designed to abstract out from everyone’s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.180" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">experience,</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">those things that are material and constant<br />have enabled us to produce</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:40.930" style="s2">technological implements of extreme power,<br />right, both for good, at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.930" end="00:05:42.569" style="s2">with regards to medical advances,</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.569" end="00:05:48.590" style="s2">and also for ill, in terms of our ability<br />to control weapons of unbelievable destructive</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.590" end="00:05:49.150" style="s2">force.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.150" end="00:05:54.860" style="s2">So we’re more powerful. Are we any smarter<br />or any wiser?</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.860" end="00:05:59.460" style="s2">Well I think a casual glance at the history<br />of the 20th Century would suggest that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.460" end="00:05:59.949" style="s2">we’re not.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.949" end="00:06:03.830" style="s2">I don’t think there’s any indication whatsoever,<br />although perhaps things have improved in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.830" end="00:06:05.639" style="s2">last fifteen years,</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.639" end="00:06:12.349" style="s2">that an additional consequence of our capacity<br />to extract ourselves from our religious modes</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.349" end="00:06:13.139" style="s2">of thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.139" end="00:06:17.610" style="s2">has been a palpable increase in wisdom or<br />tolerance or compassion,</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.610" end="00:06:22.270" style="s2">or a palpable increase in our ability to understand<br />explicitly what might constitute the basis</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.270" end="00:06:27.990" style="s2">for a suitable and stable state.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.990" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">So you might take, for example, the fact that<br />the 20th Century has been unbelievably bloody,</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:38.340" style="s2">right, literally hundreds of millions of people<br />killed in conflicts of one form or another,</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.340" end="00:06:42.129" style="s2">both external, say, in the course of World<br />War II or Vietnam,</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.129" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">and internal, in the case of Nazi Germany<br />or the Soviet Union,</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:51.819" style="s2">or any of the vast array of countries who<br />subjected their citizens to terrible internal</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.819" end="00:06:52.690" style="s2">repression</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.690" end="00:06:55.349" style="s2">in the name of the maintenance of order.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.349" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">I mentioned that Alexander Solzhenitzyn estimated<br />that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:02.610" style="s2">sixty million people died in the Soviet Union<br />between 1919 and 1959</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.610" end="00:07:05.569" style="s2">as a consequence of internal repression,</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.569" end="00:07:09.819" style="s2">and his estimates were that perhaps twice<br />that many died during the Cultural Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.819" end="00:07:13.900" style="s2">in China.</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.900" end="00:07:20.509" style="s2">Looking back on the 20th Century, one seem,<br />one thing seems relatively clear, right.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.509" end="00:07:27.509" style="s2">Although humanity as a whole has ceased, or<br />had ceased at least to engage in large scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.690" end="00:07:31.050" style="s2">religious conflicts,</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:37.750" style="s2">although they seem to have been making a vicious<br />comeback in the last five years,</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.750" end="00:07:44.599" style="s2">our ability to live together still seems incredibly<br />compromised by our capacity to engage in ideological</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.599" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">conflict, right,</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:52.680" style="s2">and it doesn’t seem to me ridiculous to<br />presume that the battles between capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.819" end="00:07:54.190" style="s2">and communism, say,</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.190" end="00:07:57.020" style="s2">or between capitalism, communism and fascism</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.020" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">, or even the emergent struggle between fundamentalist<br />Islam and the West,</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:07.550" style="s2">can necessarily be regarded as anything but<br />extensions of our tendency towards religious</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.550" end="00:08:09.449" style="s2">and mythological conflict,</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.449" end="00:08:14.659" style="s2">even though, in principle, systems like communism<br />and fascism were not predicated on explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.659" end="00:08:17.430" style="s2">religious presuppositions.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.430" end="00:08:24.430" style="s2">Well it seems to me that a logical conclusion<br />from observations of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.599" end="00:08:31.900" style="s2">is that even if you eradicate the traditional<br />trappings of the mythological worldview,</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.900" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">which seems to be what’s happened as a consequence<br />of our rise in empirical knowledge,</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:41.669" style="s2">that you don’t eradicate the tendency for<br />people to formulate groups, belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.669" end="00:08:48.230" style="s2">, around conceptions of ways that you should<br />behave</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.230" end="00:08:52.370" style="s2">that are, at the very least, religious in<br />structure and action, even if they’re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.370" end="00:08:53.260" style="s2">religious in name;</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.260" end="00:08:56.930" style="s2">I mean I think it’s a very peculiar coincidence,<br />for example,</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.930" end="00:09:01.410" style="s2">that the Soviet Communists erected at Male<br />Trinity</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.410" end="00:09:08.410" style="s2">Marx, Lenin and Stalin as an apparent replacement<br />for the masculine trinity</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.870" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">that comprised the essential deities of Orthodox,<br />Russian Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">Why would these forms re-emerge so spontaneously,</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:24.050" style="s2">and what does it mean that people who regard<br />themselves as essentially modern and empirical</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.050" end="00:09:31.050" style="s2">in their presuppositions seem to be absolutely<br />susceptible in their fundament to ideological</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.430" end="00:09:33.110" style="s2">claims?</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.110" end="00:09:36.140" style="s2">Well if you look at the Soviet Union, which<br />I think is a very instructive case</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.140" end="00:09:42.920" style="s2">because the Soviets, the Russians, were really<br />the last European power to fall prey to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.920" end="00:09:43.529" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.529" end="00:09:47.019" style="s2">between empiricism and science and religion,</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.019" end="00:09:50.190" style="s2">and they didn’t really fall prey to that<br />until the mid 1800’s</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.190" end="00:09:54.820" style="s2">because Russia was a relatively closed society,<br />relatively illiterate,</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.820" end="00:10:00.940" style="s2">maintaining a medieval structure far past<br />the time when other European countries had</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.940" end="00:10:02.620" style="s2">abandoned that.</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.620" end="00:10:07.029" style="s2">In the 1850’s, a wave of atheism spread<br />across Russia,</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.029" end="00:10:12.610" style="s2">in some sense as a wave of enlightenment,<br />but also as a plague,</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.610" end="00:10:19.610" style="s2">and figures as powering as Tolstoy</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.420" end="00:10:25.300" style="s2">remembered in his memoirs the very day that<br />he realized</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.300" end="00:10:31.610" style="s2">that the empirical discoveries of Western<br />Europeans had eradicated his ability to believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.610" end="00:10:33.430" style="s2">in the Russian Orthodox system.</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.430" end="00:10:37.230" style="s2">You lose something like that, what happens?</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.230" end="00:10:43.480" style="s2">Well if you believe that mythological thinking<br />is nothing but superstitious empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.480" end="00:10:47.639" style="s2">and that it’s been replaced entirely by<br />a more appropriate modern view, then nothing</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.639" end="00:10:48.120" style="s2">happens, right,</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.120" end="00:10:52.730" style="s2">it’s all to your benefit to become enlightened,<br />but if you believe that there’s more to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.730" end="00:10:53.860" style="s2">the story than that,</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.860" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">and that more traditional, ethical and moral<br />systems predicated on mythological presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:04.440" style="s2">offer you a map of how to behave and what<br />to think and how to regulate your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.440" end="00:11:05.720" style="s2">and what to strive for,</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.720" end="00:11:11.029" style="s2">none of which can be replaced by a scientific<br />perspective, then the eradication of a system</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.029" end="00:11:12.760" style="s2">like that leaves a vacuum,</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.760" end="00:11:16.339" style="s2">and then the question is, what rushes in to<br />fill a vacuum?</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.339" end="00:11:19.720" style="s2">Well if you look at the case of the Soviet<br />Union, it seems quite instructive, doesn’t</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.720" end="00:11:20.029" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.029" end="00:11:25.240" style="s2">I mean, there’s a thirty-year period where<br />there’s tremendous intellectual clash,</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.240" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">say between a materialist, an empirical perspective,<br />and in Russian Orthodox perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.110" end="00:11:38.459" style="s2">The Russian Orthodox perspective loses its<br />attractiveness for the reigning intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.459" end="00:11:39.329" style="s2">elite</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.329" end="00:11:43.540" style="s2">and the presuppositions of communism which<br />appear rational by contrast,</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.540" end="00:11:48.149" style="s2">but which, by all evidence, were not, rush<br />in to fill the gap, and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.149" end="00:11:52.550" style="s2">I want to read you something that Nietzsche<br />wrote, it’s perhaps the most famous thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.550" end="00:11:53.880" style="s2">he ever said,</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.880" end="00:11:57.889" style="s2">although it’s almost entirely taken out<br />of context and misquoted, and if not misquoted,</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.889" end="00:11:59.589" style="s2">at least misunderstood,</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.589" end="00:12:03.899" style="s2">because Nietzsche was one of these strange<br />people who was capable of living 50 or even</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.899" end="00:12:05.610" style="s2">100 years into the future,</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.610" end="00:12:11.160" style="s2">and although he was, is, generally regarded<br />as an enemy of Christianity and superstition,</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.160" end="00:12:15.139" style="s2">and was certainly an unbelievably outspoken<br />of Christian… opponent of Christian traditionalism,</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.139" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">How similar. Don’t know exactly how similar<br />but that’s what stories tell you how similar.</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:28.360" style="s2">One of the fundamental theses of this course<br />is that in, in modern literature, and in literature</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:33.769" style="s2">that isn’t so modern, there’s the notion<br />of a human-created monster, Frankenstein,</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.769" end="00:12:38.149" style="s2">right, springs to mind, and at an adequate<br />time, I mean, Frankenstein was a, a fantasy,</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.149" end="00:12:42.850" style="s2">an unconscious fantasy, a dream in, in actuality,<br />about the potential dangers of unbridled technological</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.850" end="00:12:49.180" style="s2">advancement, right, Why is that? Well maybe<br />it’s something like this, and, and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.180" end="00:12:53.300" style="s2">is certainly a, a notion that Jung would agree<br />with, if we don’t develop a moral sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.300" end="00:12:57.899" style="s2">as conscious and as elaborated as our technological<br />sense, the fact that we’re increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.899" end="00:13:00.870" style="s2">capable of becoming increasingly powerful<br />will necessarily do us in, right.</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.870" end="00:13:05.690" style="s2">The bigger your weapons, the smarter you better<br />be to control them, and so maybe it is something</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.690" end="00:13:09.709" style="s2">like this, maybe, and this is a strict Jungian<br />notion, maybe five hundred years ago when</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.709" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">we started to ratchet up the rate at which<br />we were developing our technological expertise,</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:19.720" style="s2">and left our mythological and religious presuppositions<br />and conceptions behind as archaic and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.720" end="00:13:25.630" style="s2">as predicated on superstition , maybe we need<br />to spend as much time updating them and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.630" end="00:13:29.610" style="s2">them into the domain of clear consciousness<br />and control as we have spent on developing</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.610" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">our technological sense.</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:37.389" style="s2">If you were a medieval Christian or an archaic<br />religious thinker of any sort, your first</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.389" end="00:13:42.130" style="s2">presupposition was that the world and the<br />cosmos existed exactly as they appeared,</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.130" end="00:13:48.380" style="s2">which with you or at least your village or<br />town or country at the center, and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.380" end="00:13:53.949" style="s2">with the earth at the center, and with the<br />cosmos as a shield around the earth, and with</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.949" end="00:13:56.820" style="s2">the earth itself as the domain of man being<br />a fundamental attribute of the cosmos.</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.820" end="00:14:02.699" style="s2">So this is a quotation from Jung, and it’s<br />one I like a lot because I think it adequately</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.699" end="00:14:09.699" style="s2">and succinctly describes the distinction between<br />the way that modern people think, and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.699" end="00:14:16.649" style="s2">way that people think if they’re still ensconced<br />within a traditional belief form, How totally,</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.649" end="00:14:22.870" style="s2">different, did the world appear to medieval<br />man. For him the earth was eternally fixed</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.870" end="00:14:28.529" style="s2">and it rest in the center of the universe<br />encircled by the course of a sun that solicitously</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.529" end="00:14:29.470" style="s2">bestowed its warmth,</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.470" end="00:14:34.540" style="s2">Despite the fact that pre-empirical people<br />had to deal with death and disease on a scale</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.540" end="00:14:41.540" style="s2">that I think is completely unknown to us,<br />it doesn’t seem unreasonable to presuppose</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.130" end="00:14:43.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.880" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">there was a certain degree of comfort to be<br />found in a worldview of this sort,</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.139" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">right, because it appeared at least to the<br />casual observer that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:14:59.970" style="s2">the cosmos was human centric,</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.970" end="00:15:06.970" style="s2">and that the notion that human purpose was<br />in some way associated with cosmic significance,</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.240" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">seemed to be beyond question, at least in<br />part because there were no theories of reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:19.230" style="s2">that would compete with that initial preconception.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.230" end="00:15:26.230" style="s2">Men were all children of God unto the loving<br />care of the most High, who prepared them for</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.230" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">eternal blessedness, and all knew exactly<br />what they should do and how they should conduct</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:34.550" style="s2">themselves in order to rise from a corruptible<br />world to an incorruptible and joyous existence.</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.550" end="00:15:39.930" style="s2">Such a life no longer seems real to us, even<br />in our dreams. Natural science has long ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.930" end="00:15:41.720" style="s2">torn this lovely veil to shreds.</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.720" end="00:15:44.410" style="s2">how is it that people could think that way</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.410" end="00:15:47.100" style="s2">given that it was so wrong and still survive?</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.100" end="00:15:50.380" style="s2">Given that in large part we are necessarily<br />creatures of tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.380" end="00:15:54.329" style="s2">How is it that we can sever the ties with<br />the manner in which our ancestors thought,</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.329" end="00:15:55.959" style="s2">and suffer no ill consequences in result?</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.959" end="00:15:58.839" style="s2">People think automatically, and, and I think<br />for good reasons, that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.839" end="00:16:02.819" style="s2">the march of human thought has been unbroken<br />progress towards increased rationality,</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.819" end="00:16:07.829" style="s2">increased power, increased clarity, but it’s<br />certainly the case that as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.829" end="00:16:09.910" style="s2">sacrifice of our religious beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.910" end="00:16:13.910" style="s2">and our philosophical beliefs that problems<br />of meaning have become more paramount for</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.910" end="00:16:15.269" style="s2">the modern person.</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.269" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2">And then you might ask, well what exactly<br />are the consequences of that,</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:21.199" style="s2">and I think initially the best perspective<br />to take is one that’s historical.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.199" end="00:16:24.350" style="s2">As we’ve moved away from a classical, mystical<br />or mythological worldview,</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.350" end="00:16:26.430" style="s2">a number of dramatic occurrences have unfolded,</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.430" end="00:16:28.500" style="s2">we’ve become much more technologically powerful,<br />right.</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.500" end="00:16:32.560" style="s2">The application of a strict empirical model<br />designed to abstract out from everyone’s</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.560" end="00:16:32.910" style="s2">experience,</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.910" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">those things that are material and constant<br />have enabled us to produce</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">technological implements of extreme power,<br />right, both for good, at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:43.850" style="s2">with regards to medical advances,</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.850" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">and also for ill, in terms of our ability<br />to control weapons of unbelievable destructive</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:47.389" style="s2">force.</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.389" end="00:16:50.430" style="s2">So we’re more powerful. Are we any smarter<br />or any wiser?</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.430" end="00:16:55.990" style="s2">Well I think a casual glance at the history<br />of the 20th Century would suggest that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.990" end="00:16:56.709" style="s2">we’re not.</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.709" end="00:17:00.589" style="s2">I don’t think there’s any indication whatsoever,<br />although perhaps things have improved in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.589" end="00:17:01.190" style="s2">last fifteen years,</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.190" end="00:17:06.410" style="s2">that an additional consequence of our capacity<br />to extract ourselves from our religious modes</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.410" end="00:17:07.260" style="s2">of thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.260" end="00:17:14.260" style="s2">has been a palpable increase in wisdom or<br />tolerance or compassion,</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.260" end="00:17:19.280" style="s2">or a palpable increase in our ability to understand<br />explicitly what might constitute the basis</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.280" end="00:17:24.600" style="s2">for a suitable and stable state.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.600" end="00:17:30.070" style="s2">So you might take, for example, the fact that<br />the 20th Century has been unbelievably bloody,</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.070" end="00:17:34.740" style="s2">right, literally hundreds of millions of people<br />killed in conflicts of one form or another,</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.740" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">both external, say, in the course of World<br />War II or Vietnam,</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:43.890" style="s2">and internal, in the case of Nazi Germany<br />or the Soviet Union,</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.890" end="00:17:50.890" style="s2">or any of the vast array of countries who<br />subjected their citizens to terrible internal</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.710" end="00:17:53.410" style="s2">repression</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.410" end="00:18:00.410" style="s2">in the name of the maintenance of order.</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.930" end="00:18:07.930" style="s2">I mentioned that Alexander Solzhenitzyn estimated<br />that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.820" end="00:18:15.510" style="s2">sixty million people died in the Soviet Union<br />between 1919 and 1959</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.510" end="00:18:17.380" style="s2">as a consequence of internal repression,</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.380" end="00:18:24.380" style="s2">and his estimates were that perhaps twice<br />that many died during the Cultural Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.000" end="00:18:31.960" style="s2">in China.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.960" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">Looking back on the 20th Century, one seem,<br />one thing seems relatively clear, right.</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.340" end="00:18:46.340" style="s2">Although humanity as a whole has ceased, or<br />had ceased at least to engage in large scale</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.980" end="00:18:49.160" style="s2">religious conflicts,</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.160" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">although they seem to have been making a vicious<br />comeback in the last five years,</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.650" end="00:19:10.650" style="s2">our ability to live together still seems incredibly<br />compromised by our capacity to engage in ideological</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.100" end="00:19:17.700" style="s2">conflict, right,</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.700" end="00:19:22.040" style="s2">and it doesn’t seem to me ridiculous to<br />presume that the battles between capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.040" end="00:19:22.440" style="s2">and communism, say,</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.440" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">or between capitalism, communism and fascism</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:26.500" style="s2">, or even the emergent struggle between fundamentalist<br />Islam and the West,</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.500" end="00:19:31.500" style="s2">can necessarily be regarded as anything but<br />extensions of our tendency towards religious</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.500" end="00:19:32.820" style="s2">and mythological conflict,</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.820" end="00:19:38.980" style="s2">even though, in principle, systems like communism<br />and fascism were not predicated on explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.980" end="00:19:39.860" style="s2">religious presuppositions.</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.860" end="00:19:46.850" style="s2">Well it seems to me that a logical conclusion<br />from observations of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.850" end="00:19:53.110" style="s2">is that even if you eradicate the traditional<br />trappings of the mythological worldview,</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.110" end="00:20:00.110" style="s2">which seems to be what’s happened as a consequence<br />of our rise in empirical knowledge,</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.210" end="00:20:07.210" style="s2">that you don’t eradicate the tendency for<br />people to formulate groups, belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.780" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">, around conceptions of ways that you should<br />behave</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:20.140" style="s2">that are, at the very least, religious in<br />structure and action, even if they’re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.140" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">religious in name;</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:25.610" style="s2">I mean I think it’s a very peculiar coincidence,<br />for example,</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.610" end="00:20:28.670" style="s2">that the Soviet Communists erected at Male<br />Trinity</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.670" end="00:20:33.640" style="s2">Marx, Lenin and Stalin as an apparent replacement<br />for the masculine trinity</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.640" end="00:20:37.130" style="s2">that comprised the essential deities of Orthodox,<br />Russian Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.130" end="00:20:40.040" style="s2">Why would these forms re-emerge so spontaneously,</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.040" end="00:20:45.740" style="s2">and what does it mean that people who regard<br />themselves as essentially modern and empirical</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.740" end="00:20:50.770" style="s2">in their presuppositions seem to be absolutely<br />susceptible in their fundament to ideological</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.770" end="00:20:51.150" style="s2">claims?</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.150" end="00:20:58.150" style="s2">Well if you look at the Soviet Union, which<br />I think is a very instructive case</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.690" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">because the Soviets, the Russians, were really<br />the last European power to fall prey to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:07.890" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.890" end="00:21:10.420" style="s2">between empiricism and science and religion,</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.420" end="00:21:14.130" style="s2">and they didn’t really fall prey to that<br />until the mid 1800’s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.130" end="00:21:17.380" style="s2">because Russia was a relatively closed society,<br />relatively illiterate,</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.380" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">maintaining a medieval structure far past<br />the time when other European countries had</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:22.690" style="s2">abandoned that.</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.690" end="00:21:26.660" style="s2">In the 1850’s, a wave of atheism spread<br />across Russia,</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.660" end="00:21:31.330" style="s2">in some sense as a wave of enlightenment,<br />but also as a plague,</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.330" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">and figures as powering as Tolstoy</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:33.850" style="s2">remembered in his memoirs the very day that<br />he realized</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.850" end="00:21:39.130" style="s2">that the empirical discoveries of Western<br />Europeans had eradicated his ability to believe</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.130" end="00:21:41.450" style="s2">in the Russian Orthodox system.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.450" end="00:21:44.710" style="s2">You lose something like that, what happens?</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.710" end="00:21:48.530" style="s2">Well if you believe that mythological thinking<br />is nothing but superstitious empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.530" end="00:21:52.670" style="s2">and that it’s been replaced entirely by<br />a more appropriate modern view, then nothing</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.670" end="00:21:53.260" style="s2">happens, right,</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.260" end="00:21:59.580" style="s2">it’s all to your benefit to become enlightened,<br />but if you believe that there’s more to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.580" end="00:22:02.310" style="s2">the story than that,</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.310" end="00:22:06.090" style="s2">and that more traditional, ethical and moral<br />systems predicated on mythological presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.090" end="00:22:11.240" style="s2">offer you a map of how to behave and what<br />to think and how to regulate your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.240" end="00:22:12.730" style="s2">and what to strive for,</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.730" end="00:22:19.730" style="s2">none of which can be replaced by a scientific<br />perspective, then the eradication of a system</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.050" end="00:22:21.020" style="s2">like that leaves a vacuum,</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.020" end="00:22:23.880" style="s2">and then the question is, what rushes in to<br />fill a vacuum?</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.880" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">Well if you look at the case of the Soviet<br />Union, it seems quite instructive, doesn’t</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.070" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:38.510" style="s2">I mean, there’s a thirty-year period where<br />there’s tremendous intellectual clash,</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.510" end="00:22:43.950" style="s2">say between a materialist, an empirical perspective,<br />and in Russian Orthodox perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.950" end="00:22:48.430" style="s2">The Russian Orthodox perspective loses its<br />attractiveness for the reigning intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.430" end="00:22:48.900" style="s2">elite</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.900" end="00:22:52.220" style="s2">and the presuppositions of communism which<br />appear rational by contrast,</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.220" end="00:22:57.190" style="s2">but which, by all evidence, were not, rush<br />in to fill the gap, and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.190" end="00:23:03.270" style="s2">I want to read you something that Nietzsche<br />wrote, it’s perhaps the most famous thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.270" end="00:23:05.300" style="s2">he ever said,</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.300" end="00:23:12.300" style="s2">although it’s almost entirely taken out<br />of context and misquoted, and if not misquoted,</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.430" end="00:23:15.140" style="s2">at least misunderstood,</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.140" end="00:23:22.140" style="s2">because Nietzsche was one of these strange<br />people who was capable of living 50 or even</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.770" end="00:23:26.570" style="s2">100 years into the future,</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.570" end="00:23:33.570" style="s2">and although he was, is, generally regarded<br />as an enemy of Christianity and superstition,</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.410" end="00:23:40.950" style="s2">and was certainly an unbelievably outspoken<br />of Christian… opponent of Christian traditionalism,</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.950" end="00:23:46.530" style="s2">he also knew that if you let the old Gods<br />die,</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.530" end="00:23:51.820" style="s2">the probability that blood would flood the<br />land was virtually 100%,</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.820" end="00:23:58.820" style="s2">so let me read you what he wrote with respect<br />to precisely this point:</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">Have you not heard of that mad man who lit<br />a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.940" end="00:24:14.940" style="s2">to the marketplace and cried incessantly,<br />I seek God. As many of those who do not believe</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.500" end="00:24:17.170" style="s2">in God were standing around just then, he<br />provoked must, much laughter. Why, did he</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.170" end="00:24:17.820" style="s2">get lost, said one. Did he lose his way like<br />a child, said another, or is he hiding, is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.820" end="00:24:18.550" style="s2">he afraid of us, is he going on a voyage or<br />emigrated, thus they yelled and laughed. The</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.550" end="00:24:20.220" style="s2">mad man jumped into their midst and pierced<br />them with his glances. Wither is God, he cried,</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.220" end="00:24:26.090" style="s2">I shall tell you. We have killed him, you<br />and I. All of us are his murderers. But how</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.090" end="00:24:30.590" style="s2">have we done this, how were we able to drink<br />up the sea, who gave us the sponge to wipe</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.590" end="00:24:33.060" style="s2">away the entire horizon, what did we do when<br />we unchanged this earth from its sun? Wither</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.060" end="00:24:33.680" style="s2">is it moving now? Wither are we moving now?<br />Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continuously</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.680" end="00:24:34.260" style="s2">backwards, sideward, forward, in all directions?<br />Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.260" end="00:24:34.810" style="s2">as though through an infinite nothing, did<br />we not feel the breath of empty space, has</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.810" end="00:24:35.530" style="s2">it not become colder, is not night and more<br />night coming on all the while, must not lanterns</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.530" end="00:24:37.230" style="s2">be lit in the morning, do we not hear anything<br />yet of the noise of the grave diggers who</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.230" end="00:24:38.630" style="s2">are burying God, do we not smell anything<br />yet of God’s decomposition? Gods, too, decompose.</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.630" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">God is dead, God remains dead, and we have<br />killed him. How shall we, the murderer of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:46.560" style="s2">all murderers, comfort ourselves? What was<br />holiest and most powerful of all that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.560" end="00:24:51.280" style="s2">world has yet owned has bled to death under<br />our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us?</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.280" end="00:24:52.920" style="s2">What water is there for us to clean ourselves,<br />what festivals of atonement, what sacred game</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.920" end="00:24:53.610" style="s2">shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness<br />of this deed too great for us? Must we not</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.610" end="00:24:53.940" style="s2">ourselves become God simply to seem worthy<br />of it?</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.940" end="00:24:54.120" style="s2">Well as you can tell,</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.120" end="00:24:54.560" style="s2">that’s a much different notion from the<br />casual God is dead quotation</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.560" end="00:24:55.060" style="s2">that’s most generally associated with Nietzsche<br />. Well what is he saying? Well he’s saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.060" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">something like this:</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.600" end="00:24:55.660" style="s2">A system like Christianity,</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.660" end="00:24:55.880" style="s2">or any system that’s con, that’s oriented<br />a society for thousands and thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.880" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">can’t simply be, be eradicated by a casual<br />gesture without consequences ensuing in its</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:24:56.090" style="s2">aftermath.</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.090" end="00:24:56.120" style="s2">What consequences?</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.120" end="00:24:56.280" style="s2">Well Nietzsche says, well we’ll no longer<br />know up from down.</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.280" end="00:24:57.580" style="s2">What does he mean by that, metaphorically?</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.580" end="00:25:01.850" style="s2">Well up, that’s where you’re headed, right?<br />And down, that’s what you want to stay away</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.850" end="00:25:02.130" style="s2">from,</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.130" end="00:25:05.710" style="s2">and when you eradicate the most fundamental<br />presuppositions of your system of values,</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.710" end="00:25:09.300" style="s2">then there is no up and there is no down,<br />and then where are you precisely? Well it’s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.300" end="00:25:10.840" style="s2">not so easy, it’s not so easy to say, having<br />not necessarily ever been in that position.</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.840" end="00:25:14.730" style="s2">What is your life like when you don’t know<br />up from down? Is it merely neutral?</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.730" end="00:25:17.340" style="s2">Is, is there merely no value left, or could<br />it possibly be the case that if up and down</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.340" end="00:25:17.430" style="s2">have both been eradicated,</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.430" end="00:25:18.050" style="s2">that the place that you’re left in is something<br />much more akin to a permanent state of suffering,</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.050" end="00:25:19.580" style="s2">because maybe it’s only the case that the<br />constant capacity to strive for up,</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.580" end="00:25:20.830" style="s2">and being an up that you believe in,</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.830" end="00:25:25.470" style="s2">the constant striving for up is actually what<br />makes your life normal to you,</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.470" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">and if you lost the sense of up and down,<br />the place that you would end up would be not</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:32.610" style="s2">so much neutral as terrible.</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.610" end="00:25:33.620" style="s2">Now if you have any belief system at all,<br />you do this, so let’s say you’re an advocate</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.620" end="00:25:33.770" style="s2">of left wing politics,</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.770" end="00:25:37.830" style="s2">you take a pro-environmental stance, or an<br />anti-corporate stance,</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.830" end="00:25:40.160" style="s2">which is a relatively common thing to do among<br />undergraduates.</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.160" end="00:25:42.660" style="s2">What do you do when you hold that belief system?</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.660" end="00:25:43.770" style="s2">You view the world as it lays itself out,</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.770" end="00:25:45.040" style="s2">and you explain the manner in which it manifests<br />itself in terms of the axioms of that belief</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.040" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">system,</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:47.410" style="s2">and you may know that you can do it, right,</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.410" end="00:25:51.360" style="s2">you can tell a credible story about why the<br />world is the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.360" end="00:25:51.670" style="s2">by adopting, say, an anti-corporate perspective,<br />because there are all sorts of terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.670" end="00:25:51.730" style="s2">about the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.730" end="00:25:51.910" style="s2">that are a consequence, say, of corporate<br />maneuvering,</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.910" end="00:25:52.150" style="s2">and you might also say that, and Piaget would<br />say this,</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.150" end="00:25:53.190" style="s2">that it’s a necessary developmental stage<br />to acquire allegiance to a given belief system.</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.190" end="00:25:53.290" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.290" end="00:25:54.620" style="s2">Well any up is better than none, that might<br />be the first observation,</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.620" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">so even if your belief system is relatively<br />insufficient and easily challenged on intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:25:57.570" style="s2">grounds</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.570" end="00:25:57.960" style="s2">and perhaps not very complete anyways, the<br />fact that it does lay out a moral structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.960" end="00:25:59.160" style="s2">and tell you good from evil and right from<br />wrong, that’s a, that’s a plus, that’s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.160" end="00:25:59.170" style="s2">an advantage.</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.170" end="00:25:59.250" style="s2">Now it’s relative intellectual weakness<br />and it’s incoherence assuming it, it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.250" end="00:25:59.300" style="s2">incoherent to some degree, that’s a flaw,</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.300" end="00:26:02.870" style="s2">but that doesn’t mean that the effort to<br />establish a system like that is worthless;</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.870" end="00:26:02.870" style="s2">moral system.</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.330" end="00:26:05.890" style="s2">is because they felt that the order Hitler<br />promised repressive as it was,</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.890" end="00:26:07.530" style="s2">was preferable to the chaos that was likely<br />to ensue in its absence.</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.530" end="00:26:08.860" style="s2">What is it about chaos that’s so terrifying?</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.860" end="00:26:10.170" style="s2">Second Nietzsche said: adopting a belief system<br />of any sort and imposing coherency on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.170" end="00:26:10.580" style="s2">viewing it through the lens of that explicit<br />system disciplines your mind.</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.580" end="00:26:10.950" style="s2">So for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.950" end="00:26:12.440" style="s2">to live in the absence of any stated beliefs<br />is hardly to live at all.</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.440" end="00:26:13.370" style="s2">To live in the presence of a narrow minded<br />and extreme belief system</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.370" end="00:26:14.920" style="s2">is at least to undergo the rigors both behavioral<br />and intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.920" end="00:26:15.950" style="s2">of coming to terms with the world from some<br />perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.950" end="00:26:17.050" style="s2">Nietzsche said the reason the modern mind<br />such as it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.050" end="00:26:18.490" style="s2">was able to free itself from the past at all<br />was because it had first thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.490" end="00:26:18.660" style="s2">as a consequence of that subordination to<br />then break free of it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.660" end="00:26:18.930" style="s2">In all science of morals so far one thing<br />was lacking strange as it may sound the problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.930" end="00:26:18.950" style="s2">of morality itself.</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.950" end="00:26:19.690" style="s2">What was lacking was any suspicion that there<br />was something problematic here.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.690" end="00:26:20.140" style="s2">Every society every functioning individual<br />every functioning family every social unit</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.140" end="00:26:20.310" style="s2">has a moral code.</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.310" end="00:26:20.680" style="s2">But they differ. So what does that mean exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.680" end="00:26:21.260" style="s2">what, it’s complicated isn&#39;t it because<br />the fact of the universality of the code</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.260" end="00:26:21.830" style="s2">the fact of the code indicates that the code<br />or a code is necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.830" end="00:26:22.450" style="s2">By the same token the fact that there&#39;s a<br />multiplicity of codes seems to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.450" end="00:26:22.860" style="s2">that the particulars of a given code aren&#39;t<br />necessarily relevant</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.860" end="00:26:22.900" style="s2">and so Nietzsche says brilliantly I think<br />we’re faced with a problem.</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.900" end="00:26:22.930" style="s2">No life without morality - no absolute morality.<br />What do we do?</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.930" end="00:26:23.340" style="s2">One of the things Jung observed was that if<br />you look at the structure of stories</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.340" end="00:26:23.850" style="s2">we thought first there&#39;s a relationship between<br />stories and moral codes.</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.850" end="00:26:24.710" style="s2">Well seems relatively straightforward doesn’t<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.710" end="00:26:25.040" style="s2">You tell a simple story like a parable sometimes<br />they&#39;re complex too like an Aesop’s fable</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.040" end="00:26:25.060" style="s2">say.</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.060" end="00:26:25.620" style="s2">What do you extract out from the story? A<br />moral.</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.620" end="00:26:26.290" style="s2">and that person does better or worse and the<br />moral of the story is if you act in this manner</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.290" end="00:26:26.460" style="s2">you will do better or worse.</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.460" end="00:26:26.510" style="s2">Proverbial knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.510" end="00:26:26.620" style="s2">We all tell stories.</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.620" end="00:26:27.010" style="s2">They have identifiable structure you can tell<br />that because the movie studio in Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.010" end="00:26:27.370" style="s2">can produce a movie and people all over the<br />world will watch it</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.370" end="00:26:27.750" style="s2">people all over the world all over the world<br />tell stories to one another.</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.750" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">The plot elements seem similar. Are the morals<br />similar?</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:28.300" style="s2">That’s a more difficult question, right,</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.300" end="00:26:28.390" style="s2">we know that the details of morality can vary<br />from culture to culture,</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.390" end="00:26:28.450" style="s2">is there anything that doesn’t vary from<br />culture to culture?</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.450" end="00:26:28.490" style="s2">Why would you wanna find that?</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.490" end="00:26:28.580" style="s2">Well Alexander Solzhenitsyn thought that one<br />of the most important occurrences of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.580" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.590" end="00:26:28.610" style="s2">were the Nuremberg trials.</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.610" end="00:26:28.700" style="s2">The Nuremberg trials brought the perpetrators<br />of the Nazi genocide to justice</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.700" end="00:26:29.570" style="s2">and that’s easy to be cynical about that<br />and perhaps you should be cynical about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.570" end="00:26:30.610" style="s2">and so of course the losers were going to<br />be tried from the perspective of the winner’s</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.610" end="00:26:30.770" style="s2">moral code</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.770" end="00:26:33.620" style="s2">but Solzhenitsyn says well wait you know there&#39;s<br />something more to this story at least there</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.620" end="00:26:34.330" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.330" end="00:26:36.250" style="s2">in that many of the events that characterized<br />the Nazi atrocities</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.250" end="00:26:36.300" style="s2">were so awful, outside of intellectual argumentation,<br />because you can provide an intellectual argument</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.300" end="00:26:36.310" style="s2">for anything</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.310" end="00:26:36.350" style="s2">they were so awful that the proper visceral<br />embodied response of any observer</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.350" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">regardless of specific moral code should be<br />repugnant. Period. Such that encoded at least</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:36.410" style="s2">initially in international law</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.410" end="00:26:36.460" style="s2">genocide is a crime against humanity. Right.<br />No matter what the particulars of your moral</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.460" end="00:26:36.470" style="s2">code.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.470" end="00:26:36.510" style="s2">So goes the logic. You cannot construct a<br />viable moral code that enables genocide,</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.510" end="00:26:36.560" style="s2">if not a logical impossibility and I think<br />it is a logical impossibility</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.560" end="00:26:36.570" style="s2">it’s an ethical impossibility.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.570" end="00:26:36.620" style="s2">And then you have to ask yourself, and this<br />is not precisely an intellectual question,</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.620" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">does that seem credible to you.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:36.690" style="s2">Does it seem credible that there are acts<br />that are so terrible</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.690" end="00:26:36.730" style="s2">that no one regardless of their stated position<br />should ever engage in them.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.730" end="00:26:36.790" style="s2">And if the answer is yes then I would say<br />well if you haven&#39;t moved towards personal</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.790" end="00:26:36.810" style="s2">accept acceptance of an ultimate &quot;up”</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.810" end="00:26:36.940" style="s2">so to speak you’ve certainly identified<br />at least one &quot;down&quot; that you don’t want</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.940" end="00:26:36.980" style="s2">to approach.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.980" end="00:26:37.260" style="s2">And that’s the beginnings of the establishment<br />of some notion of absolute moral authority.</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.260" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">So what if we said, hypothetically something<br />like this.</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:37.690" style="s2">Let’s say that morality isn&#39;t a philosophy,<br />it’s not something explicit, something implicit.</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.690" end="00:26:37.770" style="s2">How does it evolve?</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.770" end="00:26:37.860" style="s2">Well emotional creatures produce it,</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.860" end="00:26:38.810" style="s2">you don’t have to produce it in isolation<br />if you were weren&#39;t a social animal i</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.810" end="00:26:39.050" style="s2">if you lived a solitary and nocturnal existence,by<br />yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.050" end="00:26:39.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no need for morality because you don’t<br />have to regulate your behaviour</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.400" end="00:26:39.810" style="s2">with regards to your peers but you&#39;re social<br />animals so you&#39;re stuck with everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.810" end="00:26:40.130" style="s2">but everybody else could be conceived us as<br />a grand average right.</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.130" end="00:26:40.350" style="s2">How would you act towards the average person.</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.350" end="00:26:41.700" style="s2">I would say that very, very stable moral systems<br />tell you exactly that and the say things like:</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.700" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">do unto others as you would have them do unto<br />you. Right? Basic principle of reciprocity.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">what am I doing that’s unacceptable and<br />not good</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.280" end="00:26:43.400" style="s2">it who knows</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.400" end="00:26:44.040" style="s2">is distributed sanity you don’t have to<br />be that sane, as long as you&#39;re hanging around</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.040" end="00:26:44.120" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.120" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">because as soon as you do something that’s<br />deviant they&#39;re gonna raise an eyebrow at</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:44.750" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.750" end="00:26:44.860" style="s2">and the you think oh well. Not that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.860" end="00:26:45.090" style="s2">And as soon as you do something good then<br />they&#39;re gonna pay more attention and smile</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.090" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">at you</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:45.640" style="s2">so all of the information about how to regulate<br />yourself is out there in the world right,</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.640" end="00:26:45.740" style="s2">the averaged person.</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.740" end="00:26:47.420" style="s2">How many people do you interact with in a<br />week? 300 say maybe it’s not that many,</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.420" end="00:26:47.570" style="s2">100.</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.570" end="00:26:51.580" style="s2">How about in a year, thousand, 2000, 5000,<br />10,000 what are they all telling you?</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.580" end="00:26:53.660" style="s2">Well the message is similar across people.</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.660" end="00:26:58.860" style="s2">How similar. Don’t know exactly how similar<br />but that’s what stories tell you how similar.</p>
