One of the 
fundamental theses of this course is thatin, in modern literature, and in literature
that isn’t so modern, there’s the notionof a human-created monster, Frankenstein,
right, springs to mind, and at an adequatetime, I mean, Frankenstein was a, a fantasy,
an unconscious fantasy, a dream in, in actuality,about the potential dangers of unbridled technological
advancement, right, Why is that? Well maybeit’s something like this, and, and this
is certainly a, a notion that Jung would agreewith, if we don’t develop a moral sense
as conscious and as elaborated as our technologicalsense, the fact that we’re increasingly
capable of becoming increasingly powerfulwill necessarily do us in, right.
The bigger your weapons, the smarter you betterbe to control them, and so maybe it is something
like this, maybe, and this is a strict Jungiannotion, maybe five hundred years ago when
we started to ratchet up the rate at whichwe were developing our technological expertise,
and left our mythological and religious presuppositionsand conceptions behind as archaic and perhaps
as predicated on superstition , maybe we needto spend as much time updating them and bringing
them into the domain of clear consciousnessand control as we have spent on developing
our technological sense.
If you were a medieval Christian or an archaicreligious thinker of any sort, your first
presupposition was that the world and thecosmos existed exactly as they appeared,
which with you or at least your village ortown or country at the center, and certainly
with the earth at the center, and with thecosmos as a shield around the earth, and with
the earth itself as the domain of man beinga fundamental attribute of the cosmos.
So this is a quotation from Jung, and it’sone I like a lot because I think it adequately
and succinctly describes the distinction betweenthe way that modern people think, and the
way that people think if they’re still ensconcedwithin a traditional belief form, How totally,
different, did the world appear to medievalman. For him the earth was eternally fixed
and it rest in the center of the universeencircled by the course of a sun that solicitously
bestowed its warmth,
Despite the fact that pre-empirical peoplehad to deal with death and disease on a scale
that I think is completely unknown to us,it doesn’t seem unreasonable to presuppose
that
there was a certain degree of comfort to befound in a worldview of this sort,
right, because it appeared at least to thecasual observer that
the cosmos was human centric,
and that the notion that human purpose wasin some way associated with cosmic significance,
seemed to be beyond question, at least inpart because there were no theories of reality
that would compete with that initial preconception.
Men were all children of God unto the lovingcare of the most High, who prepared them for
eternal blessedness, and all knew exactlywhat they should do and how they should conduct
themselves in order to rise from a corruptibleworld to an incorruptible and joyous existence.
Such a life no longer seems real to us, evenin our dreams. Natural science has long ago
torn this lovely veil to shreds.
how is it that people could think that way
given that it was so wrong and still survive?
Given that in large part we are necessarilycreatures of tradition.
How is it that we can sever the ties withthe manner in which our ancestors thought,
and suffer no ill consequences in result?
People think automatically, and, and I thinkfor good reasons, that
the march of human thought has been unbrokenprogress towards increased rationality,
increased power, increased clarity, but it’scertainly the case that as a consequence of
sacrifice of our religious beliefs
and our philosophical beliefs that problemsof meaning have become more paramount for
the modern person.
And then you might ask, well what exactlyare the consequences of that,
and I think initially the best perspectiveto take is one that’s historical.
As we’ve moved away from a classical, mysticalor mythological worldview,
a number of dramatic occurrences have unfolded,
we’ve become much more technologically powerful,right.
The application of a strict empirical modeldesigned to abstract out from everyone’s
experience,
those things that are material and constanthave enabled us to produce
technological implements of extreme power,right, both for good, at least in principle
with regards to medical advances,
and also for ill, in terms of our abilityto control weapons of unbelievable destructive
force.
So we’re more powerful. Are we any smarteror any wiser?
Well I think a casual glance at the historyof the 20th Century would suggest that perhaps
we’re not.
I don’t think there’s any indication whatsoever,although perhaps things have improved in the
last fifteen years,
that an additional consequence of our capacityto extract ourselves from our religious modes
of thought
has been a palpable increase in wisdom ortolerance or compassion,
or a palpable increase in our ability to understandexplicitly what might constitute the basis
for a suitable and stable state.
So you might take, for example, the fact thatthe 20th Century has been unbelievably bloody,
right, literally hundreds of millions of peoplekilled in conflicts of one form or another,
both external, say, in the course of WorldWar II or Vietnam,
and internal, in the case of Nazi Germanyor the Soviet Union,
or any of the vast array of countries whosubjected their citizens to terrible internal
repression
in the name of the maintenance of order.
I mentioned that Alexander Solzhenitzyn estimatedthat
sixty million people died in the Soviet Unionbetween 1919 and 1959
as a consequence of internal repression,
and his estimates were that perhaps twicethat many died during the Cultural Revolution
in China.
Looking back on the 20th Century, one seem,one thing seems relatively clear, right.
Although humanity as a whole has ceased, orhad ceased at least to engage in large scale
religious conflicts,
although they seem to have been making a viciouscomeback in the last five years,
our ability to live together still seems incrediblycompromised by our capacity to engage in ideological
conflict, right,
and it doesn’t seem to me ridiculous topresume that the battles between capitalism
and communism, say,
or between capitalism, communism and fascism
, or even the emergent struggle between fundamentalistIslam and the West,
can necessarily be regarded as anything butextensions of our tendency towards religious
and mythological conflict,
even though, in principle, systems like communismand fascism were not predicated on explicitly
religious presuppositions.
Well it seems to me that a logical conclusionfrom observations of that sort
is that even if you eradicate the traditionaltrappings of the mythological worldview,
which seems to be what’s happened as a consequenceof our rise in empirical knowledge,
that you don’t eradicate the tendency forpeople to formulate groups, belief systems
, around conceptions of ways that you shouldbehave
that are, at the very least, religious instructure and action, even if they’re not
religious in name;
I mean I think it’s a very peculiar coincidence,for example,
that the Soviet Communists erected at MaleTrinity
Marx, Lenin and Stalin as an apparent replacementfor the masculine trinity
that comprised the essential deities of Orthodox,Russian Orthodox Christianity.
Why would these forms re-emerge so spontaneously,
and what does it mean that people who regardthemselves as essentially modern and empirical
in their presuppositions seem to be absolutelysusceptible in their fundament to ideological
claims?
Well if you look at the Soviet Union, whichI think is a very instructive case
because the Soviets, the Russians, were reallythe last European power to fall prey to the
conflict
between empiricism and science and religion,
and they didn’t really fall prey to thatuntil the mid 1800’s
because Russia was a relatively closed society,relatively illiterate,
maintaining a medieval structure far pastthe time when other European countries had
abandoned that.
In the 1850’s, a wave of atheism spreadacross Russia,
in some sense as a wave of enlightenment,but also as a plague,
and figures as powering as Tolstoy
remembered in his memoirs the very day thathe realized
that the empirical discoveries of WesternEuropeans had eradicated his ability to believe
in the Russian Orthodox system.
You lose something like that, what happens?
Well if you believe that mythological thinkingis nothing but superstitious empiricism
and that it’s been replaced entirely bya more appropriate modern view, then nothing
happens, right,
it’s all to your benefit to become enlightened,but if you believe that there’s more to
the story than that,
and that more traditional, ethical and moralsystems predicated on mythological presuppositions
offer you a map of how to behave and whatto think and how to regulate your emotions
and what to strive for,
none of which can be replaced by a scientificperspective, then the eradication of a system
like that leaves a vacuum,
and then the question is, what rushes in tofill a vacuum?
Well if you look at the case of the SovietUnion, it seems quite instructive, doesn’t
it.
I mean, there’s a thirty-year period wherethere’s tremendous intellectual clash,
say between a materialist, an empirical perspective,and in Russian Orthodox perspective.
The Russian Orthodox perspective loses itsattractiveness for the reigning intellectual
elite
and the presuppositions of communism whichappear rational by contrast,
but which, by all evidence, were not, rushin to fill the gap, and
I want to read you something that Nietzschewrote, it’s perhaps the most famous thing
he ever said,
although it’s almost entirely taken outof context and misquoted, and if not misquoted,
at least misunderstood,
because Nietzsche was one of these strangepeople who was capable of living 50 or even
100 years into the future,
and although he was, is, generally regardedas an enemy of Christianity and superstition,
and was certainly an unbelievably outspokenof Christian… opponent of Christian traditionalism,
How similar. Don’t know exactly how similarbut that’s what stories tell you how similar.
One of the fundamental theses of this courseis that in, in modern literature, and in literature
that isn’t so modern, there’s the notionof a human-created monster, Frankenstein,
right, springs to mind, and at an adequatetime, I mean, Frankenstein was a, a fantasy,

I want to read you something that Nietzschewrote, it’s perhaps the most famous thing
he ever said,
although it’s almost entirely taken outof context and misquoted, and if not misquoted,
at least misunderstood,
because Nietzsche was one of these strangepeople who was capable of living 50 or even
100 years into the future,
and although he was, is, generally regardedas an enemy of Christianity and superstition,
and was certainly an unbelievably outspokenof Christian… opponent of Christian traditionalism,
he also knew that if you let the old Godsdie,
the probability that blood would flood theland was virtually 100%,
so let me read you what he wrote with respectto precisely this point:
Have you not heard of that mad man who lita lantern in the bright morning hours, ran
to the marketplace and cried incessantly,I seek God. As many of those who do not believe
in God were standing around just then, heprovoked must, much laughter. Why, did he
get lost, said one. Did he lose his way likea child, said another, or is he hiding, is
he afraid of us, is he going on a voyage oremigrated, thus they yelled and laughed. The
mad man jumped into their midst and piercedthem with his glances. Wither is God, he cried,
I shall tell you. We have killed him, youand I. All of us are his murderers. But how
have we done this, how were we able to drinkup the sea, who gave us the sponge to wipe
away the entire horizon, what did we do whenwe unchanged this earth from its sun? Wither
is it moving now? Wither are we moving now?Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continuously
backwards, sideward, forward, in all directions?Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying
as though through an infinite nothing, didwe not feel the breath of empty space, has
it not become colder, is not night and morenight coming on all the while, must not lanterns
be lit in the morning, do we not hear anythingyet of the noise of the grave diggers who
are burying God, do we not smell anythingyet of God’s decomposition? Gods, too, decompose.
God is dead, God remains dead, and we havekilled him. How shall we, the murderer of
all murderers, comfort ourselves? What washoliest and most powerful of all that the
world has yet owned has bled to death underour knives. Who will wipe this blood off us?
What water is there for us to clean ourselves,what festivals of atonement, what sacred game
shall we have to invent? Is not the greatnessof this deed too great for us? Must we not
ourselves become God simply to seem worthyof it?
Well as you can tell,
that’s a much different notion from thecasual God is dead quotation
that’s most generally associated with Nietzsche. Well what is he saying? Well he’s saying
something like this:
A system like Christianity,
or any system that’s con, that’s orienteda society for thousands and thousands of years
can’t simply be, be eradicated by a casualgesture without consequences ensuing in its
aftermath.
What consequences?
Well Nietzsche says, well we’ll no longerknow up from down.
What does he mean by that, metaphorically?
Well up, that’s where you’re headed, right?And down, that’s what you want to stay away
from,
and when you eradicate the most fundamentalpresuppositions of your system of values,
then there is no up and there is no down,and then where are you precisely? Well it’s
not so easy, it’s not so easy to say, havingnot necessarily ever been in that position.
What is your life like when you don’t knowup from down? Is it merely neutral?
Is, is there merely no value left, or couldit possibly be the case that if up and down
have both been eradicated,
that the place that you’re left in is somethingmuch more akin to a permanent state of suffering,
because maybe it’s only the case that theconstant capacity to strive for up,
and being an up that you believe in,
the constant striving for up is actually whatmakes your life normal to you,
and if you lost the sense of up and down,the place that you would end up would be not
so much neutral as terrible.
Now if you have any belief system at all,you do this, so let’s say you’re an advocate
of left wing politics,
you take a pro-environmental stance, or ananti-corporate stance,
which is a relatively common thing to do amongundergraduates.
What do you do when you hold that belief system?
You view the world as it lays itself out,
and you explain the manner in which it manifestsitself in terms of the axioms of that belief
system,
and you may know that you can do it, right,
you can tell a credible story about why theworld is the way it is
by adopting, say, an anti-corporate perspective,because there are all sorts of terrible things
about the world
that are a consequence, say, of corporatemaneuvering,
and you might also say that, and Piaget wouldsay this,
that it’s a necessary developmental stageto acquire allegiance to a given belief system.
Why?
Well any up is better than none, that mightbe the first observation,
so even if your belief system is relativelyinsufficient and easily challenged on intellectual
grounds
and perhaps not very complete anyways, thefact that it does lay out a moral structure
and tell you good from evil and right fromwrong, that’s a, that’s a plus, that’s
an advantage.
Now it’s relative intellectual weaknessand it’s incoherence assuming it, it is
incoherent to some degree, that’s a flaw,
but that doesn’t mean that the effort toestablish a system like that is worthless;
moral system.
is because they felt that the order Hitlerpromised repressive as it was,
was preferable to the chaos that was likelyto ensue in its absence.
What is it about chaos that’s so terrifying?
Second Nietzsche said: adopting a belief systemof any sort and imposing coherency on the
viewing it through the lens of that explicitsystem disciplines your mind.
So for example
to live in the absence of any stated beliefsis hardly to live at all.
To live in the presence of a narrow mindedand extreme belief system
is at least to undergo the rigors both behavioraland intellectual
of coming to terms with the world from someperspective.
Nietzsche said the reason the modern mindsuch as it is
was able to free itself from the past at allwas because it had first thoroughly
as a consequence of that subordination tothen break free of it.
In all science of morals so far one thingwas lacking strange as it may sound the problem
of morality itself.
What was lacking was any suspicion that therewas something problematic here.
Every society every functioning individualevery functioning family every social unit
has a moral code.
But they differ. So what does that mean exactly
what, it’s complicated isn't it becausethe fact of the universality of the code
the fact of the code indicates that the codeor a code is necessary.
By the same token the fact that there's amultiplicity of codes seems to suggest
that the particulars of a given code aren'tnecessarily relevant
and so Nietzsche says brilliantly I thinkwe’re faced with a problem.
No life without morality - no absolute morality.What do we do?
One of the things Jung observed was that ifyou look at the structure of stories
we thought first there's a relationship betweenstories and moral codes.
Well seems relatively straightforward doesn’tit.
You tell a simple story like a parable sometimesthey're complex too like an Aesop’s fable
say.
What do you extract out from the story? Amoral.
and that person does better or worse and themoral of the story is if you act in this manner
you will do better or worse.
Proverbial knowledge.
We all tell stories.
They have identifiable structure you can tellthat because the movie studio in Hollywood
can produce a movie and people all over theworld will watch it
people all over the world all over the worldtell stories to one another.
The plot elements seem similar. Are the moralssimilar?
That’s a more difficult question, right,
we know that the details of morality can varyfrom culture to culture,
is there anything that doesn’t vary fromculture to culture?
Why would you wanna find that?
Well Alexander Solzhenitsyn thought that oneof the most important occurrences of the 20th
century
were the Nuremberg trials.
The Nuremberg trials brought the perpetratorsof the Nazi genocide to justice
and that’s easy to be cynical about thatand perhaps you should be cynical about it
and so of course the losers were going tobe tried from the perspective of the winner’s
moral code
but Solzhenitsyn says well wait you know there'ssomething more to this story at least there
seems to be
in that many of the events that characterizedthe Nazi atrocities
were so awful, outside of intellectual argumentation,because you can provide an intellectual argument
for anything
they were so awful that the proper visceralembodied response of any observer
regardless of specific moral code should berepugnant. Period. Such that encoded at least
initially in international law
genocide is a crime against humanity. Right.No matter what the particulars of your moral
code.
So goes the logic. You cannot construct aviable moral code that enables genocide,
if not a logical impossibility and I thinkit is a logical impossibility
it’s an ethical impossibility.
And then you have to ask yourself, and thisis not precisely an intellectual question,
does that seem credible to you.
Does it seem credible that there are actsthat are so terrible
that no one regardless of their stated positionshould ever engage in them.
And if the answer is yes then I would saywell if you haven't moved towards personal
accept acceptance of an ultimate "up”
so to speak you’ve certainly identifiedat least one "down" that you don’t want
to approach.
And that’s the beginnings of the establishmentof some notion of absolute moral authority.
So what if we said, hypothetically somethinglike this.
Let’s say that morality isn't a philosophy,it’s not something explicit, something implicit.
How does it evolve?
Well emotional creatures produce it,
you don’t have to produce it in isolationif you were weren't a social animal i
if you lived a solitary and nocturnal existence,byyourself
there's no need for morality because you don’thave to regulate your behaviour
with regards to your peers but you're socialanimals so you're stuck with everybody else
but everybody else could be conceived us asa grand average right.
How would you act towards the average person.
I would say that very, very stable moral systemstell you exactly that and the say things like:
do unto others as you would have them do untoyou. Right? Basic principle of reciprocity.
what am I doing that’s unacceptable andnot good
it who knows
is distributed sanity you don’t have tobe that sane, as long as you're hanging around
other people
because as soon as you do something that’sdeviant they're gonna raise an eyebrow at
you
and the you think oh well. Not that.
And as soon as you do something good thenthey're gonna pay more attention and smile
at you
so all of the information about how to regulateyourself is out there in the world right,
the averaged person.
How many people do you interact with in aweek? 300 say maybe it’s not that many,
100.
How about in a year, thousand, 2000, 5000,10,000 what are they all telling you?
Well the message is similar across people.
How similar. Don’t know exactly how similarbut that’s what stories tell you how similar.
