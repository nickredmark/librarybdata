<p begin="00:00:00.709" end="00:00:07.940" style="s2">all right so today we are doing an idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.130" end="00:00:11.519" style="s2">Cafe on what makes a project game beat</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.940" end="00:00:13.110" style="s2">or rather game be transition because are</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.519" end="00:00:17.160" style="s2">we ever getting to gain me it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.110" end="00:00:17.670" style="s2">other a whole other question so anyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.160" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">want to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.670" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">in usually in the ID cafe we all take a</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.619" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">turn or we have an open conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:27.090" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to do that but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:33.649" style="s2">be in direct idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.090" end="00:00:36.530" style="s2">we&#39;d like to start I could start</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.649" end="00:00:41.070" style="s2">although I guess I don&#39;t feel very</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.530" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">qualified I get I guess it&#39;d be anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.070" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">that&#39;s exploring the space of game B or</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:48.840" style="s2">can help us transition to what we think</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:51.420" style="s2">game B might like might be like like</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.840" end="00:00:53.100" style="s2">Julie said we don&#39;t have a definition to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:55.860" style="s2">game B and it&#39;s one of those things that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">they say once you define it it&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.860" end="00:00:59.309" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:04.049" style="s2">but but things that are kind of leading</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.309" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">that way so things that help us to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.049" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">know the Omega rule where you try and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">listen for signal and everyone that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:21.020" style="s2">can or things that help us to be more</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">decentralized be more inclusive and less</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.020" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">rival wrists so that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:41.900" style="s2">what comes to top of mine when I hear</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:41.900" style="s2">that question can I see yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">for me game beam is reducing inequality</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.150" end="00:01:59.580" style="s2">and for that I believe what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:02:01.700" style="s2">with Kari is that cops are the way to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.580" end="00:02:01.700" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.480" end="00:02:10.530" style="s2">so to hear more than that in the open</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.430" end="00:02:15.290" style="s2">discussion if you don&#39;t want to expand</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.530" end="00:02:19.050" style="s2">more on it now for me a game B project</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.290" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of what Bentley said a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.050" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">that it&#39;s its Omni win that its</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:25.560" style="s2">antivirus practice and Omega rule is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:29.310" style="s2">definitely good start lowering</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">inequality it&#39;s like the perp there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.310" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">the perfect project I&#39;m sure that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:37.320" style="s2">never actually obtainable especially</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">right now and so it&#39;s just how many of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.320" end="00:02:42.270" style="s2">the interconnecting circles of values do</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:45.270" style="s2">you possess in your project and the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.270" end="00:02:50.550" style="s2">that we can be transparent and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.270" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">democratic or better or decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.550" end="00:02:56.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of qualities that I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:58.110" style="s2">are in that sphere but where they</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.370" end="00:02:59.670" style="s2">interconnect is is the question right</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.110" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">maybe you can&#39;t do decentralized yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.670" end="00:03:04.050" style="s2">maybe you can&#39;t do fully transparent yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:05.520" style="s2">but wanting to get more and more towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.050" end="00:03:06.780" style="s2">that side and also I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.520" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">acknowledge that I&#39;ve been up for 10</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:12.180" style="s2">hours since 2:00 in the morning my fire</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:13.530" style="s2">alarm went off so I my brain is extra</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.180" end="00:03:16.970" style="s2">extra right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.530" end="00:03:16.970" style="s2">so whoever would like to go next</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.390" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">next so I mean I agree with everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.210" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">that&#39;s been said so far I think cuz sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:29.590" style="s2">of an overall it being sustainable which</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:32.440" style="s2">is both like from you know not damaging</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.590" end="00:03:35.770" style="s2">things but then also a model that&#39;s able</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.440" end="00:03:37.570" style="s2">to sustain itself so actually like given</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.770" end="00:03:41.800" style="s2">that at least in the transition it has</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.570" end="00:03:43.510" style="s2">to work in a game a world working just</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.800" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">enough by the game rules to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.510" end="00:03:49.180" style="s2">sustain itself will not be encountered</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:50.890" style="s2">to the point of that existing and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.180" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">that approach it needs to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.890" end="00:03:55.900" style="s2">compete in the current model and win</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:03:57.190" style="s2">however that works which I think you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.900" end="00:03:59.590" style="s2">know goes towards the working together</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.190" end="00:04:01.870" style="s2">of the cooperative&#39;s the like that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.590" end="00:04:04.270" style="s2">when I think about it it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.870" end="00:04:05.980" style="s2">the best of both worlds from the two</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.270" end="00:04:08.050" style="s2">competing models that people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.980" end="00:04:10.300" style="s2">think about as the only models where you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.050" end="00:04:13.660" style="s2">know there&#39;s capitalism and socialism</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.300" end="00:04:16.090" style="s2">and to me it&#39;s sort of the the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.660" end="00:04:19.810" style="s2">where there&#39;s the it&#39;s competitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.090" end="00:04:21.579" style="s2">enough but not rival risk and it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.810" end="00:04:23.890" style="s2">of the people working together but</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.579" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">outside of the like we don&#39;t need to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.890" end="00:04:28.840" style="s2">the government&#39;s to do it it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:31.930" style="s2">forcing it it&#39;s about working together</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.840" end="00:04:33.130" style="s2">enough to make it work and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.930" end="00:04:35.080" style="s2">why it needs to be able to out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.130" end="00:04:36.669" style="s2">because it&#39;s not using the government to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.080" end="00:04:39.820" style="s2">force that approach on people it needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.669" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">to be able to enter the arena and come</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.820" end="00:04:44.770" style="s2">out on top just by people working</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:47.580" style="s2">together and doing what&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.770" end="00:04:47.580" style="s2">sustain itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.860" end="00:04:55.429" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll go right and have you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.349" end="00:04:58.279" style="s2">what you&#39;ve all set</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.429" end="00:04:59.749" style="s2">but look it needs to be metastable haha</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.279" end="00:05:01.339" style="s2">I don&#39;t even know what that means but</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.749" end="00:05:03.979" style="s2">it&#39;s Santa cause I had you brought tight</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.339" end="00:05:07.129" style="s2">once it needs to be metastable so and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.979" end="00:05:11.119" style="s2">also her flat won&#39;t seem saying that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.129" end="00:05:12.889" style="s2">whatever you do needs to be strong</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.119" end="00:05:15.349" style="s2">enough so I don&#39;t know what this might</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.889" end="00:05:19.819" style="s2">mean metastable but strong enough to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.349" end="00:05:22.339" style="s2">withstand any challenges it faces and to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.819" end="00:05:25.610" style="s2">be able to get stronger with those</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.339" end="00:05:27.259" style="s2">challenges so not being crushed by</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.610" end="00:05:30.139" style="s2">challenges you may not even thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.259" end="00:05:32.680" style="s2">about and being able to survive that but</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.139" end="00:05:36.770" style="s2">also get stronger as it does that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.680" end="00:05:40.009" style="s2">maybe take the status quo of what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.770" end="00:05:42.050" style="s2">right at the moment and create something</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.009" end="00:05:44.659" style="s2">that&#39;s different and like as I said that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.050" end="00:05:48.039" style="s2">we think he says and transcends and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.659" end="00:05:51.080" style="s2">includes what&#39;s out there already and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.039" end="00:05:53.089" style="s2">yeah an omni win and and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.080" end="00:05:55.849" style="s2">benefits it&#39;s not just a case of well</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.089" end="00:05:57.319" style="s2">you know I&#39;m in charge I&#39;m the boss so</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.849" end="00:06:00.709" style="s2">I&#39;ll just benefit the most while</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.319" end="00:06:04.189" style="s2">everybody&#39;s working shit I was somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.709" end="00:06:05.839" style="s2">of yeah um but yeah so being able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.189" end="00:06:08.329" style="s2">sort of like everybody wins out of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.839" end="00:06:10.219" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a case of them someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.329" end="00:06:15.110" style="s2">just takes all the money and runs and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.219" end="00:06:17.869" style="s2">it&#39;s just everybody gets to have a piece</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.110" end="00:06:19.939" style="s2">of what they put into and and it works</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.869" end="00:06:22.969" style="s2">you know I mean and as I said if it can</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.939" end="00:06:25.309" style="s2">spread out in there and not not just be</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.969" end="00:06:28.669" style="s2">our project for yourself as well but</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.309" end="00:06:31.399" style="s2">also to spread out in the the local</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.669" end="00:06:34.999" style="s2">communities and be able to help them as</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.399" end="00:06:37.459" style="s2">well so and not just be standalone as</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.999" end="00:06:39.050" style="s2">most game a stuff is it&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.459" end="00:06:41.300" style="s2">standalone we don&#39;t want to play out</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.050" end="00:06:42.919" style="s2">with others whereas with a game be think</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.300" end="00:06:44.719" style="s2">it&#39;d be like yeah I&#39;ll play out with</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.919" end="00:06:47.149" style="s2">your enough and we&#39;ll spread what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.719" end="00:06:49.550" style="s2">doing and as I said I&#39;m not being avid</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.149" end="00:06:51.949" style="s2">everything behind paywalls that people</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.550" end="00:06:54.349" style="s2">can&#39;t access when they need it and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.949" end="00:06:56.180" style="s2">just of that really so that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.349" end="00:06:57.709" style="s2">everything I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.180" end="00:07:00.789" style="s2">yeah and everything forever your sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.709" end="00:07:00.789" style="s2">as well that&#39;d be good</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:13.350" style="s2">yeah everything yourself and one point I</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.760" end="00:07:17.670" style="s2">think MA and maybe like we&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.350" end="00:07:20.430" style="s2">spectrum and then a is like extreme end</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.670" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">of the spectrum because it uses just one</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.430" end="00:07:28.470" style="s2">metric for playing the game the game</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:30.620" style="s2">being ABCD whatever and its profit so</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.470" end="00:07:33.270" style="s2">everything that is done purely and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.620" end="00:07:36.690" style="s2">exclusively for profit this time I I</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.270" end="00:07:40.110" style="s2">think that&#39;s how we can define it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.690" end="00:07:42.360" style="s2">then various stages of you know when</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.110" end="00:07:45.420" style="s2">there&#39;s the company that is kind of for</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.360" end="00:07:48.020" style="s2">profit but the profit a side effect of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.420" end="00:07:51.300" style="s2">doing something but even in</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.020" end="00:07:55.080" style="s2">non-transparent way that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:58.290" style="s2">beginning of game B and then the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.080" end="00:08:01.790" style="s2">other and of the spectrum would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.290" end="00:08:07.380" style="s2">something that is done like completely</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.790" end="00:08:10.680" style="s2">in a transparent manner for the greater</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.380" end="00:08:21.990" style="s2">good or you know completely regardless</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.680" end="00:08:23.880" style="s2">of the profits that&#39;s on so right that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.990" end="00:08:26.070" style="s2">was everyone this weekend I&#39;m you and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.880" end="00:08:26.520" style="s2">have an open conversation for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.070" end="00:08:29.790" style="s2">remainder</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.520" end="00:08:32.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a record I think all six people</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.790" end="00:08:35.010" style="s2">sharing an idea cafe and done with him</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.760" end="00:08:36.510" style="s2">he&#39;d have minutes that means we each of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.010" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">us took less than two minutes to share</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.510" end="00:08:41.550" style="s2">we got it we got the parameters for what</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.570" style="s2">I can&#39;t be project this was just waiting</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.550" end="00:08:49.470" style="s2">for one person to be like you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.570" end="00:08:51.090" style="s2">wrong as this yeah voluntary was a big</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.470" end="00:08:53.220" style="s2">when a drone star I was like right I</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.090" end="00:08:54.750" style="s2">forgot to mention what the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.220" end="00:08:56.370" style="s2">have to be voluntary which is part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.750" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">the OU community game a as well as</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.370" end="00:09:03.030" style="s2">antifragility which Kerry mentioned I do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:04.710" style="s2">want to look guidance I was gonna say I</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.030" end="00:09:08.790" style="s2">might want to challenge on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.710" end="00:09:11.070" style="s2">anti-fertility part I think that well I</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.790" end="00:09:13.500" style="s2">guess it depends on where the project is</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.070" end="00:09:15.100" style="s2">in its stage some of our projects will</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.500" end="00:09:16.900" style="s2">be experiment</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.100" end="00:09:18.790" style="s2">they&#39;ll be learning things and those</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.900" end="00:09:20.980" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be anti fragile but if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.790" end="00:09:22.750" style="s2">when we&#39;re building when our project is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.980" end="00:09:25.420" style="s2">to build something that we hope to last</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.750" end="00:09:27.640" style="s2">we&#39;d want to make it anti fragile</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.420" end="00:09:30.520" style="s2">although now I&#39;m thinking about you do</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.640" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">want to keep things fresh you do want</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.520" end="00:09:35.350" style="s2">things to be maybe self-destructive like</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:37.660" style="s2">if their purpose no longer exists then</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.350" end="00:09:39.340" style="s2">people should disperse and go elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.660" end="00:09:40.630" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a different theme</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.340" end="00:09:42.760" style="s2">anything but that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.630" end="00:09:44.920" style="s2">I thought when I was hearing it well</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.760" end="00:09:46.330" style="s2">yeah I understand that cuz like as I</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:48.970" style="s2">said there&#39;s loads of saucer-like</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.330" end="00:09:51.700" style="s2">charities that are set up for a single</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.970" end="00:09:53.530" style="s2">papers right and then it doesn&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.700" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">about the papers what they&#39;ve been set</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.530" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">up for anymore</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:58.360" style="s2">it just comes about keeping themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:02.170" style="s2">in a job and keeping themselves going</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.360" end="00:10:04.180" style="s2">which it I get that so I think maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.170" end="00:10:05.950" style="s2">you build in something and like as I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.180" end="00:10:08.620" style="s2">said like it&#39;s a lot of businesses so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.950" end="00:10:10.330" style="s2">columns are due to Co good 19 because he</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.620" end="00:10:13.990" style="s2">didn&#39;t foresee what if we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.330" end="00:10:16.960" style="s2">to have any customers anymore and so - I</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.990" end="00:10:20.080" style="s2">think as Brett Ryan seen you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.960" end="00:10:23.260" style="s2">have an evolutionary stable strategy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.080" end="00:10:26.290" style="s2">develop one of them so so if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.260" end="00:10:28.780" style="s2">you purpose but that know is to create</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:31.240" style="s2">something that helps people out and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.780" end="00:10:34.180" style="s2">once that that purpose has been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.240" end="00:10:37.390" style="s2">like done I think you should build into</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.180" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">you build into it built into it right</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.390" end="00:10:42.910" style="s2">okay so what at the end of the day the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:45.400" style="s2">reap dumbness it&#39;s all being finished or</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.910" end="00:10:47.230" style="s2">not needed any longer I think you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.400" end="00:10:49.480" style="s2">to build into a plan right what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.230" end="00:10:50.860" style="s2">going to do after that you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.480" end="00:10:52.690" style="s2">because as assembly because if you build</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.860" end="00:10:54.670" style="s2">that into the plan and then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.690" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">going to get people going oh my job my</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.670" end="00:11:00.010" style="s2">job got to keep my job you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">yeah but if you if you plant and build</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.010" end="00:11:04.540" style="s2">other stuff around on that so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:06.760" style="s2">just the one thing okay the papers might</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.540" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">have been the driving force or you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.760" end="00:11:11.770" style="s2">also things that promote without that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:14.490" style="s2">one developed alongside it so you could</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.770" end="00:11:17.710" style="s2">have things being developed in parallel</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.490" end="00:11:20.500" style="s2">so when that kind of mine happens and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.710" end="00:11:23.560" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not where again and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.500" end="00:11:24.910" style="s2">fine but the case of coab in 19 when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.560" end="00:11:26.950" style="s2">you know obviously you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.910" end="00:11:28.060" style="s2">be able to operate the way you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.950" end="00:11:29.890" style="s2">do anymore</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.060" end="00:11:31.720" style="s2">think you&#39;ve got a say right okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.890" end="00:11:33.880" style="s2">setting up this what happens if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.720" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">biggest disaster on the planet so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.880" end="00:11:38.410" style="s2">think you&#39;ve got to be ready for all</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:40.060" style="s2">sorts and as I said we get all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.410" end="00:11:43.390" style="s2">thrown at you know whenever you try and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.060" end="00:11:45.100" style="s2">do something so I think him more than as</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.390" end="00:11:47.020" style="s2">I said much I wouldn&#39;t call anti fragile</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.100" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">and roses and just being able to survive</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.020" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">withstand challenges and also get them</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:58.410" style="s2">challenges that year of to become on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:12:02.230" style="s2">other none stronger and as I said as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.410" end="00:12:04.390" style="s2">stronger what I&#39;m hearing is that game</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.230" end="00:12:06.430" style="s2">be is anti fragile but the projects</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.390" end="00:12:08.800" style="s2">aren&#39;t it&#39;s like you know if a limb is</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.430" end="00:12:10.270" style="s2">gangrenous you cut it off even though</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:11.950" style="s2">you still want that limb but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.270" end="00:12:14.920" style="s2">going to cause more damage to the being</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.950" end="00:12:18.580" style="s2">overall like with Mondragon the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.920" end="00:12:21.010" style="s2">worker cooks being it owns a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.580" end="00:12:22.990" style="s2">different entities its goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.010" end="00:12:24.100" style="s2">survive and it brings on companies but</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.990" end="00:12:25.930" style="s2">if the company isn&#39;t serving its purpose</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.100" end="00:12:29.710" style="s2">if it&#39;s costing more than it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.930" end="00:12:32.140" style="s2">then they cut it loose and so I like as</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.710" end="00:12:33.700" style="s2">Henley said in the initial stages of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.140" end="00:12:35.320" style="s2">project you&#39;re trying to contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.700" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">the overall but if it ends up not being</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.320" end="00:12:39.190" style="s2">worthwhile then alright it folds and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:41.320" style="s2">that&#39;s totally fine because the overall</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.190" end="00:12:44.590" style="s2">goal of game B&#39;s being anti fragile the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.320" end="00:12:45.700" style="s2">like if you know if my project starts to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.590" end="00:12:48.250" style="s2">take off and then it ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.700" end="00:12:49.630" style="s2">either you know more trouble then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.250" end="00:12:51.850" style="s2">worth or it has of actually being bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.630" end="00:12:54.400" style="s2">then it needs to die</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.850" end="00:12:58.930" style="s2">even though game B itself still should</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.400" end="00:13:01.780" style="s2">go forward yeah it&#39;s a lot of what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.930" end="00:13:03.820" style="s2">been talking about a lot like human the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.780" end="00:13:06.340" style="s2">human the individual humans involved in</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.820" end="00:13:07.570" style="s2">whatever way are anti fragile not</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.340" end="00:13:09.790" style="s2">because they actually anti fragile</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.570" end="00:13:11.680" style="s2">because anything we go through if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.790" end="00:13:13.840" style="s2">have the foundation of our needs being</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.680" end="00:13:15.310" style="s2">met we&#39;re able to come out stronger</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.840" end="00:13:18.100" style="s2">right we&#39;re able to know like we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.310" end="00:13:20.140" style="s2">focus on our own genius our own projects</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.100" end="00:13:22.390" style="s2">and so like there&#39;s a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.140" end="00:13:24.670" style="s2">antifragility for the individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.390" end="00:13:27.300" style="s2">then also the whole like as a project</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.670" end="00:13:30.040" style="s2">fails at whatever stage it fails at</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.300" end="00:13:31.330" style="s2">including it you know you cutting it off</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.040" end="00:13:33.010" style="s2">because it&#39;s keep on angry and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.330" end="00:13:35.110" style="s2">not a failure that&#39;s just they lived its</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.010" end="00:13:36.910" style="s2">life cycle and how it&#39;s ready to go that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.110" end="00:13:38.170" style="s2">there&#39;s a learning process in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.910" end="00:13:40.630" style="s2">because of the transparent</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.170" end="00:13:42.910" style="s2">is that the next people get to learn</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.630" end="00:13:44.019" style="s2">something and grow for it which were you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.910" end="00:13:47.860" style="s2">know I&#39;m trying to do here with together</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.019" end="00:13:52.300" style="s2">tech sharing that that because of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.860" end="00:13:53.889" style="s2">game a is so proprietary and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.300" end="00:13:55.240" style="s2">keep things hidden and you had like you</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.889" end="00:13:56.860" style="s2">have to put on our error of being</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.240" end="00:13:59.110" style="s2">professional and you can&#39;t make mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.860" end="00:14:01.000" style="s2">and if you do then you know like one</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.110" end="00:14:03.190" style="s2">other that was part of the whole Mark</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">like marketing strategy and we planned</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.190" end="00:14:08.860" style="s2">that one instead of what I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:17.470" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here and learning and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.860" end="00:14:20.050" style="s2">growing together well I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.470" end="00:14:22.660" style="s2">kind of different answer was Leo&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.050" end="00:14:24.690" style="s2">wonder if we could ask him to expand on</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.660" end="00:14:24.690" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.530" end="00:14:33.670" style="s2">I don&#39;t know cuz um Tech is working I</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.690" end="00:14:35.500" style="s2">will say when he said it I initially</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.670" end="00:14:41.880" style="s2">heard cops but I&#39;m guessing he meant</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.500" end="00:14:45.640" style="s2">coops that&#39;s my guess you&#39;re muted carry</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.880" end="00:14:48.520" style="s2">right I have to add to chat with neo</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.640" end="00:14:50.590" style="s2">before and it was basically about coops</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.520" end="00:14:53.020" style="s2">and we were talking about coops in</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.590" end="00:14:55.000" style="s2">Brazil and he was telling me about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.020" end="00:14:57.610" style="s2">place where yet without those two cops</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.000" end="00:15:02.290" style="s2">and one of them and his big problem is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.610" end="00:15:04.840" style="s2">them how&#39;d you stop corruption within a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.290" end="00:15:08.590" style="s2">co-op race so I think the big question</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.840" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">for Leo is how to stop because</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.590" end="00:15:12.430" style="s2">apparently someone&#39;s room the coop is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:16.050" style="s2">quite you look than that and all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.430" end="00:15:19.990" style="s2">money ends will go into him so how why</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.050" end="00:15:24.970" style="s2">when if you run in a cool how&#39;d you stop</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.990" end="00:15:30.730" style="s2">that from from taking over you know I</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.970" end="00:15:34.860" style="s2">mean how&#39;d you get hurt there we go how</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.730" end="00:15:37.150" style="s2">you how do you prevent it all happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.860" end="00:15:40.540" style="s2">probably I can I ask what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.150" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">cooperatives oh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.540" end="00:15:53.200" style="s2">be working it was a pet cause if I lose</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:55.660" style="s2">but taxi taxi cool so the worker co-op</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.200" end="00:16:00.149" style="s2">like the people who owns the taxis or</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.660" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">driving the taxis owned the coop yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.149" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">what was I to do during the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:06.760" style="s2">dropping the taxis owned the cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:09.010" style="s2">people with the medallions owned by</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.760" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">co-op just sounds like a taxi company</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.010" end="00:16:17.500" style="s2">actually people prolonged attack on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:20.200" style="s2">cause the probability that you need</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.500" end="00:16:23.080" style="s2">authorization from the government local</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.200" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">government and then the local</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.080" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">politicians took over the clock and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.930" end="00:16:40.209" style="s2">unfortunately with the sound quality I</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.860" end="00:16:41.200" style="s2">think their mic may have switched or</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.209" end="00:16:43.149" style="s2">something because the first time you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.200" end="00:16:44.709" style="s2">spoke it was totally clear and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.149" end="00:17:00.490" style="s2">like almost sounding like a speakerphone</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.709" end="00:17:03.459" style="s2">or something yeah and now you what so so</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.490" end="00:17:05.709" style="s2">let&#39;s see if if we understand so your</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.459" end="00:17:08.620" style="s2">example was a taxi co-op where the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.709" end="00:17:12.280" style="s2">owners of the cars and it could also be</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.620" end="00:17:14.050" style="s2">drivers there&#39;s a tax co-op and there</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.280" end="00:17:15.160" style="s2">was some corruption and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.050" end="00:17:17.170" style="s2">how do you prevent that in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.160" end="00:17:19.780" style="s2">situation and pretty much in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.170" end="00:17:23.860" style="s2">co-op and since a lot of our projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.780" end="00:17:28.300" style="s2">have to do with people cooperating and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.860" end="00:17:29.860" style="s2">then together Tec is a tech co-op we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.300" end="00:17:33.790" style="s2">handled avoiding corruption by not</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.860" end="00:17:38.290" style="s2">having money involved so far but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.790" end="00:17:41.590" style="s2">not possible in that yeah that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.290" end="00:17:43.809" style="s2">that&#39;s that is an important thing there</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.590" end="00:17:45.400" style="s2">seems to actually I&#39;ve noticed in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.809" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">last couple weeks I&#39;ve heard of several</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.400" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">different groups working on governance</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">of coops so I don&#39;t know where the space</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:04.690" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also D baby</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.540" end="00:18:09.020" style="s2">decentralize the wrong thing but</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.690" end="00:18:11.900" style="s2">autonomous organizations we have some</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.020" end="00:18:16.130" style="s2">sort of system that kind of allows</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.900" end="00:18:18.440" style="s2">everyone to participate equally so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.130" end="00:18:21.940" style="s2">know kind of like well we tried to do an</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.440" end="00:18:26.060" style="s2">R and the United States is just you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.940" end="00:18:31.070" style="s2">have no central person in charge didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.060" end="00:18:34.070" style="s2">really work out yeah so process is kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.070" end="00:18:35.570" style="s2">of like that which I think a lot of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.070" end="00:18:37.910" style="s2">lot of times there&#39;s boards and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.570" end="00:18:39.620" style="s2">like that so no one person has there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.910" end="00:18:40.910" style="s2">still collusion and stuff but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.620" end="00:18:43.910" style="s2">there&#39;s I think there&#39;s a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.910" end="00:18:46.760" style="s2">going on in that space that I would want</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.910" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">to look at before starting a new project</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.760" end="00:18:56.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve had a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:56.620" style="s2">look into that yet yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.300" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.750" end="00:19:21.849" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.929" end="00:19:43.320" style="s2">but if you type it out in the private</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:43.320" style="s2">chat</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.660" end="00:19:49.929" style="s2">one of the main ways from what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.830" end="00:19:51.670" style="s2">hearing is like you would need really</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.929" end="00:19:53.230" style="s2">good transparency so if somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.670" end="00:19:55.240" style="s2">being corrupt it&#39;s really hard to hide</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.230" end="00:19:56.530" style="s2">it and then the other side has to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.240" end="00:19:58.450" style="s2">there has to be a way to you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.530" end="00:20:02.230" style="s2">replace that person so if they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.450" end="00:20:04.809" style="s2">know like with the liquid democracy or</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.230" end="00:20:06.040" style="s2">young the shareholders eventually voting</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.809" end="00:20:07.540" style="s2">that person out or if they&#39;re just an</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.040" end="00:20:09.940" style="s2">employee then getting rid of that person</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.540" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">some method to sort of uncover it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.940" end="00:20:17.590" style="s2">then decide as a community what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:19.030" style="s2">that&#39;s important to know unfortunately I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.590" end="00:20:20.650" style="s2">still don&#39;t quite understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.030" end="00:20:22.230" style="s2">coop is because there&#39;s calling</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.650" end="00:20:25.570" style="s2">something to co-op it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.230" end="00:20:27.340" style="s2">make it a coop coop there are producer</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.570" end="00:20:28.900" style="s2">coops which sounds like that&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.340" end="00:20:30.910" style="s2">what it is that it&#39;s like the taxi</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.900" end="00:20:33.490" style="s2">owners are part of a co-op but whether</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.910" end="00:20:35.080" style="s2">if you own one taxi in that fleet or a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.490" end="00:20:38.130" style="s2">hundred taxis and that fleet if you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.080" end="00:20:41.460" style="s2">an equal vote because that is a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.130" end="00:20:43.660" style="s2">rigorous rule for coops there are some</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.460" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">wiggle room if you have a worker slash</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.660" end="00:20:48.730" style="s2">you know consumer cooperative and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:51.130" style="s2">can have a vote for each or some people</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.730" end="00:20:53.080" style="s2">have shareholder votes and such but</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.130" end="00:20:56.080" style="s2">generally speaking it&#39;s one person one</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.080" end="00:20:58.179" style="s2">vote and so but even in that like</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.080" end="00:20:59.650" style="s2">mecca&#39;s is a consumer co-op and it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.179" end="00:21:02.140" style="s2">person one vote about equipment go up</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.650" end="00:21:04.300" style="s2">and there&#39;s still problems with people</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.140" end="00:21:06.280" style="s2">taking over the board because meth gives</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.300" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">you recommendations for who to vote for</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.280" end="00:21:09.250" style="s2">and nobody looks into it so you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:10.630" style="s2">going to vote for who they recommend</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.250" end="00:21:12.250" style="s2">which means you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.630" end="00:21:15.820" style="s2">if you only have a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.250" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">time on the board it um they&#39;re keeping</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.820" end="00:21:18.490" style="s2">the people they wanted power in power</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:19.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like the Liberals constantly like</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.490" end="00:21:21.900" style="s2">yeah I vote in the next liberal vote in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.900" end="00:21:25.900" style="s2">the next liberal without actually having</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.900" end="00:21:28.630" style="s2">the brand of liberal under them and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.900" end="00:21:30.510" style="s2">work the only co-ops I consider actual</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.630" end="00:21:32.530" style="s2">co-ops that help with democracy are</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.510" end="00:21:34.690" style="s2">worker and producer</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.530" end="00:21:36.790" style="s2">sorry worker and consumer cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.690" end="00:21:40.090" style="s2">producer cooperatives are like Ocean</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.790" end="00:21:41.380" style="s2">Spray cranberry cocktail it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.090" end="00:21:43.270" style="s2">yes it&#39;s great that they have a way to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.380" end="00:21:45.130" style="s2">get their cranberries into something and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.270" end="00:21:59.560" style="s2">get profit from it but it&#39;s not helping</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.130" end="00:22:08.260" style="s2">the consumer or the worker so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.560" end="00:22:10.950" style="s2">why I guess nice because especially if</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.260" end="00:22:17.590" style="s2">you have voting on the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.950" end="00:22:25.030" style="s2">everyone is not equally familiar three</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.590" end="00:22:26.950" style="s2">people in the god everyone wonders so</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.030" end="00:22:30.070" style="s2">what is described in rate they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.950" end="00:22:33.880" style="s2">inventing organizations different models</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.070" end="00:22:37.390" style="s2">and approaches our governance could work</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.880" end="00:22:42.930" style="s2">in big and he describes really big</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.390" end="00:22:50.070" style="s2">organizations and it involves not voting</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.930" end="00:22:50.070" style="s2">at least company-wide votes so and also</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.440" end="00:22:58.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s also worth taking a look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.510" end="00:23:07.630" style="s2">because he also has some ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.200" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">something between the alternatives to</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.630" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">voting that&#39;s also kind of where reason</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.720" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">score my project comes in because</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:17.710" style="s2">instead of voting you&#39;re putting down</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:20.200" style="s2">evidence on why you should or should not</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.710" end="00:23:23.080" style="s2">do something and thus it gets past that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.200" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">issue where the people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.080" end="00:23:29.559" style="s2">it&#39;s going on and you could either have</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:31.090" style="s2">that be part of instead of voting you</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.559" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">could use reason score because it&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.090" end="00:23:35.100" style="s2">a score and you say oh it&#39;s over a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:37.269" style="s2">certain point then we then the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.100" end="00:23:39.789" style="s2">organization will do it or it could just</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.269" end="00:23:41.710" style="s2">be information available to the voters</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.789" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">and then they could vote on it depending</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.710" end="00:23:48.010" style="s2">on how mature and how trustworthy people</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:50.679" style="s2">trust in the in the system totally I</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.010" end="00:23:53.169" style="s2">think you can&#39;t have recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.679" end="00:23:55.779" style="s2">because people don&#39;t don&#39;t pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.169" end="00:23:59.980" style="s2">so you have some method to just really</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.779" end="00:24:02.169" style="s2">like boil down like maybe what you care</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.980" end="00:24:03.519" style="s2">about and then sort of score the people</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.169" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">based on that and it has to be very</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.519" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">evidence-based so that you know you you</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:10.149" style="s2">can say as a member okay I care about</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:12.580" style="s2">you know your ethics and I care about</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.149" end="00:24:13.840" style="s2">you know people not trying to line their</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.580" end="00:24:15.820" style="s2">own pockets and I care about you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.840" end="00:24:18.039" style="s2">anything else like the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.820" end="00:24:21.070" style="s2">then score people based on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.039" end="00:24:22.539" style="s2">information available what it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.070" end="00:24:25.809" style="s2">that person is sort of about and what</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.539" end="00:24:27.730" style="s2">what their history shows that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.809" end="00:24:30.940" style="s2">helps summarize it based on that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.730" end="00:24:31.750" style="s2">like as Julie said with Mountain</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.940" end="00:24:34.389" style="s2">Equipment co-op</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.750" end="00:24:36.370" style="s2">if people don&#39;t really pay attention or</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.389" end="00:24:38.950" style="s2">like if even ten percent do but then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.370" end="00:24:41.169" style="s2">organization makes recommendations that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.950" end="00:24:42.760" style="s2">is then very prone to corruption then</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.169" end="00:24:43.870" style="s2">you just have the you know the people in</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.760" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">power are going to recommend themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.870" end="00:24:50.139" style="s2">or you know yeah the person who thinks</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:53.230" style="s2">very much the same and then even though</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.139" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">you&#39;re voting that 10% just can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.230" end="00:24:56.380" style="s2">up the difference for the 90% of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:59.380" style="s2">who aren&#39;t paying attention and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.380" end="00:25:01.570" style="s2">just vote how they&#39;re told however you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.380" end="00:25:03.700" style="s2">know basically all coops night you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.570" end="00:25:06.190" style="s2">go and get 10% of the people voting so</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.700" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">it&#39;s actually somewhat if you got enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.190" end="00:25:10.779" style="s2">people together right five percent of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:13.570" style="s2">the co-operative you actually can easily</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.779" end="00:25:15.580" style="s2">sway the vote because nobody cares so</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.570" end="00:25:16.870" style="s2">it&#39;s like the board that&#39;s why the board</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.580" end="00:25:19.029" style="s2">can just recommend people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.870" end="00:25:21.610" style="s2">yep practicing my democratic right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.029" end="00:25:24.700" style="s2">that part of what a good board doesn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.610" end="00:25:26.440" style="s2">co-op instead of saying yes Mary Smith</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.700" end="00:25:28.870" style="s2">is the person we&#39;re recommending is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.440" end="00:25:30.970" style="s2">say hey we know that that Bob Sue and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.870" end="00:25:34.270" style="s2">Mike are leaving and what we need are</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.970" end="00:25:35.730" style="s2">these skill sets and then we you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.270" end="00:25:37.860" style="s2">like we think these people</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.730" end="00:25:40.020" style="s2">have the most skill sets of those but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.860" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">like what a turtle said like having that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.020" end="00:25:43.980" style="s2">actually be more transparent said of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:45.000" style="s2">being Mary it&#39;s like right we need</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.980" end="00:25:46.260" style="s2">something with accounting we need</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.000" end="00:25:48.450" style="s2">someone with marketing we need someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.260" end="00:25:50.130" style="s2">with this and then showcasing which one</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.450" end="00:25:52.290" style="s2">of them has the best marketing which one</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.130" end="00:25:53.250" style="s2">of them has the best finance maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.290" end="00:25:56.820" style="s2">there&#39;s someone with the best of all</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.250" end="00:25:58.290" style="s2">three but which like an effective gaming</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.820" end="00:26:00.600" style="s2">board that&#39;s actually how they operate</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.290" end="00:26:02.730" style="s2">is they have you know a bunch of specs</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.600" end="00:26:06.450" style="s2">saying here&#39;s the skill sets people have</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.730" end="00:26:07.830" style="s2">and you know the more sort of a equality</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.450" end="00:26:09.090" style="s2">based ones will say like here&#39;s how many</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.830" end="00:26:10.950" style="s2">men we have here so many women here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.090" end="00:26:12.750" style="s2">how many white people here&#39;s all this so</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.950" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">that you can go you know you&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.750" end="00:26:15.660" style="s2">shopping list for okay we want people</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:18.420" style="s2">that have these skills and then have</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.660" end="00:26:19.980" style="s2">these attributes lose let&#39;s go shopping</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.420" end="00:26:21.990" style="s2">and then you go and find you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.980" end="00:26:26.010" style="s2">here&#39;s three or five people and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.990" end="00:26:29.370" style="s2">can decide the between them and you want</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.010" end="00:26:32.940" style="s2">something like that but for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.370" end="00:26:34.770" style="s2">sort of a more like not as easy to sway</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.940" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">in the direction that people think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.770" end="00:26:37.680" style="s2">already going anyway or that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:38.760" style="s2">existing board thinks it should which of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.680" end="00:26:41.280" style="s2">course is one of the problems with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.760" end="00:26:42.570" style="s2">game a board is they&#39;re very much a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.280" end="00:26:48.810" style="s2">of the companies are prone to do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.570" end="00:26:51.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing to stop them it</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.810" end="00:26:53.160" style="s2">turns out ten hours is how long my fire</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.240" end="00:26:54.930" style="s2">alarm will not be pin between I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.160" end="00:26:57.770" style="s2">go deal with it and hope yeah I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.930" end="00:26:57.770" style="s2">back in a second</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.150" end="00:27:11.250" style="s2">so any other thoughts about game view</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.170" end="00:27:13.930" style="s2">projects or do we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.250" end="00:27:15.490" style="s2">some projects that aren&#39;t dengue that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.930" end="00:27:16.990" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be in game be if we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.490" end="00:27:20.680" style="s2">a little bit more critical and rival</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.990" end="00:27:22.690" style="s2">risk yeah or even not this is early</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.680" end="00:27:25.870" style="s2">projects but like attributes that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.690" end="00:27:28.750" style="s2">think might sort of come up or something</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.870" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">like if you were half of the attributes</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.750" end="00:27:33.010" style="s2">but if there was one thing that was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:35.530" style="s2">part of it you&#39;re like I&#39;d only think</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.010" end="00:27:37.660" style="s2">that&#39;s game be like I mean an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.530" end="00:27:42.850" style="s2">example is like if your based on using</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.660" end="00:27:45.250" style="s2">slavery right like right even if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.850" end="00:27:47.260" style="s2">thought which I at that point you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.250" end="00:27:48.970" style="s2">although I guess you could theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.260" end="00:27:50.170" style="s2">be a consumer cooperative to chose to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.970" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">use slavery although I think that would</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.170" end="00:27:55.240" style="s2">be weird but its theory okay possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:57.070" style="s2">yeah well maybe not yeah using but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.240" end="00:28:00.400" style="s2">if you were doing a co-op between people</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.070" end="00:28:01.750" style="s2">who are currently enslaved right well no</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.400" end="00:28:03.490" style="s2">but that&#39;s what I mean by a consumer</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.750" end="00:28:06.250" style="s2">co-op right like if the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.490" end="00:28:07.750" style="s2">voting for Emmys he said yeah we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.250" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">care go ahead and use slaves just keep</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.750" end="00:28:17.620" style="s2">the prices low again that&#39;s weird but</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:19.660" style="s2">like the possible they ironically do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.620" end="00:28:21.280" style="s2">opposite and say no we really want them</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.660" end="00:28:23.260" style="s2">to have fair wages and then no one shops</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.280" end="00:28:24.760" style="s2">there like it so but then I&#39;ll go next</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.260" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">door to Walmart it&#39;s like I want another</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.760" end="00:28:29.920" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t partly own to be ethical</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:32.920" style="s2">but then if there&#39;s a better price down</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.920" end="00:28:35.590" style="s2">the street that arise you see I reckon</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.920" end="00:28:37.780" style="s2">which yeah and I think then they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.590" end="00:28:40.420" style="s2">of does need to be like some model of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.780" end="00:28:42.700" style="s2">okay so based on what we voted on here</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.420" end="00:28:45.550" style="s2">the prices if you wouldn&#39;t shop at that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.700" end="00:28:48.090" style="s2">price then change your vote because we</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.550" end="00:28:50.980" style="s2">can&#39;t be sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.090" end="00:28:52.600" style="s2">like we&#39;re voting on something that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.980" end="00:28:56.530" style="s2">going nowhere and is going to have no</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.600" end="00:28:58.810" style="s2">impact good good job because you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.530" end="00:29:00.790" style="s2">the membership have full ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.810" end="00:29:02.170" style="s2">that and I think that happens much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.790" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">easily and like that and City the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.170" end="00:29:07.210" style="s2">cooperative that I&#39;m familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:09.250" style="s2">because although you&#39;re not voting on</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.210" end="00:29:11.590" style="s2">mortgage rates and interest rates at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.250" end="00:29:14.380" style="s2">same time you&#39;re watching them and seen</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.590" end="00:29:15.490" style="s2">and the bacons like the CEO can set</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.380" end="00:29:17.680" style="s2">their own the board can set them and</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.740" end="00:30:17.929" style="s2">what things would cost in that model</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.330" end="00:30:19.640" style="s2">would you shop here no try again until</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.929" end="00:30:21.590" style="s2">you you get to like okay it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.640" end="00:30:23.570" style="s2">perfect but maybe it&#39;s better than</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.590" end="00:30:25.040" style="s2">Walmart and better than the options out</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.570" end="00:30:27.800" style="s2">there and the price is reasonable enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.040" end="00:30:29.690" style="s2">that people if they knew the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.800" end="00:30:31.340" style="s2">things that you know like the actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.690" end="00:30:33.920" style="s2">paying and you know employees well and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.340" end="00:30:36.230" style="s2">producers and and everything all coming</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.920" end="00:30:37.880" style="s2">together as a package is yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.230" end="00:30:39.250" style="s2">consumers will always sort I mean it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.880" end="00:30:41.390" style="s2">don&#39;t think that many people would</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.250" end="00:30:43.330" style="s2">voluntarily you know vote for paying</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.390" end="00:30:46.610" style="s2">employees crappy you know and using</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.330" end="00:30:47.929" style="s2">slavery but then they also just want the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.610" end="00:30:49.970" style="s2">lowest prices and as you said they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.929" end="00:30:51.559" style="s2">just go to Walmart like okay if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.970" end="00:30:54.679" style="s2">what you would do then why are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.559" end="00:30:56.870" style="s2">voting that way when people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.679" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">shopping it back specifically sorry</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.870" end="00:31:01.640" style="s2">Bentley is that they um are their</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:04.220" style="s2">quality of goods isn&#39;t as good as it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.640" end="00:31:06.230" style="s2">used to be partly of them not just not</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.220" end="00:31:08.330" style="s2">like they&#39;re paying people well in China</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.230" end="00:31:10.010" style="s2">and places they get it made but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.330" end="00:31:11.720" style="s2">quality of goods is no longer as good</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.010" end="00:31:14.059" style="s2">and because they have basically or did</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.720" end="00:31:15.950" style="s2">have almost a lifetime warranty more</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.059" end="00:31:19.309" style="s2">people are returning it now they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.950" end="00:31:20.840" style="s2">that and that&#39;s a much bigger viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.309" end="00:31:22.820" style="s2">right it&#39;s like okay so we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.840" end="00:31:26.419" style="s2">quality goods so the person&#39;s paid well</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.820" end="00:31:28.460" style="s2">and then how we can&#39;t have a lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.419" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">warranty that doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.460" end="00:31:33.430" style="s2">what does make sense for a warrant</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:35.050" style="s2">right how long should have should a rain</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.430" end="00:31:37.300" style="s2">jacket last for before it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.050" end="00:31:39.580" style="s2">waterproof how long and getting that</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.300" end="00:31:41.560" style="s2">feedback to is part of it that data in</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.580" end="00:31:43.660" style="s2">it like hey how often do you buy your</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.560" end="00:31:45.850" style="s2">rain jacket why because it was stolen oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.660" end="00:31:47.680" style="s2">well that&#39;s different than because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.850" end="00:31:51.160" style="s2">no longer rain proof and I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.680" end="00:31:52.990" style="s2">quite lemon top oh I was I was just</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.160" end="00:31:54.910" style="s2">gonna say I wasn&#39;t sure if we were done</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.990" end="00:31:58.300" style="s2">with that specific item I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.910" end="00:32:00.520" style="s2">about other just list of other things</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.300" end="00:32:04.170" style="s2">that if we saw them as part of a project</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.520" end="00:32:07.660" style="s2">we might suggest that that projects not</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.170" end="00:32:12.910" style="s2">game B which adrià was kind of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.660" end="00:32:14.980" style="s2">about kind of elimination flags like it</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.910" end="00:32:16.900" style="s2">like well I mean I kind of struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.980" end="00:32:19.030" style="s2">this with reason score because there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.900" end="00:32:23.230" style="s2">some uses for a reason score that our</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.030" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">rival wrists that promote competition</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.230" end="00:32:29.800" style="s2">but it is a fun competition as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:32.770" style="s2">to you know and it and it drives you</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.800" end="00:32:34.810" style="s2">towards cooperation but it&#39;s competitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.770" end="00:32:37.900" style="s2">and in the middle which some people</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.810" end="00:32:40.870" style="s2">might still say encourages the attitude</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.900" end="00:32:43.900" style="s2">of competition so I don&#39;t know it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.870" end="00:32:46.300" style="s2">eliminating in that specific project but</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.900" end="00:32:50.170" style="s2">if a project is focused on profit you</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.300" end="00:32:52.750" style="s2">know and and getting other people you</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.170" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">know extracting resources I think would</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.750" end="00:32:58.030" style="s2">be one of the and not sustainable it</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:33:03.100" style="s2">would be one of the kind of factors that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.030" end="00:33:07.300" style="s2">we would look for we can expand on that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.100" end="00:33:10.090" style="s2">that extracting resources well or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.300" end="00:33:13.660" style="s2">or not taking into account all the X</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.090" end="00:33:19.060" style="s2">what&#39;s normally external impacts right</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.660" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">so a business can produce goods and just</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.060" end="00:33:23.980" style="s2">dump waste into the environment and not</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:26.140" style="s2">take care of it and thus we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.980" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">paying for their business to be cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.140" end="00:33:30.370" style="s2">right because we have to suffer the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:33.820" style="s2">consequences but it&#39;s not in their</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.370" end="00:33:35.230" style="s2">profit model so if we knew of a project</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.820" end="00:33:36.700" style="s2">that was doing that they&#39;re saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.230" end="00:33:38.200" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna have to worry about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.700" end="00:33:40.780" style="s2">because we&#39;re just gonna dump it we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.200" end="00:33:42.610" style="s2">like right right I think the question</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.780" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">with that is also how does it compare to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.610" end="00:33:47.020" style="s2">its game a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:48.700" style="s2">competition like if you had somebody</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.020" end="00:33:50.860" style="s2">that was using slavery or that was you</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.700" end="00:33:52.929" style="s2">know I had a bad environmental impact</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.860" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">but if they were like the same or</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.929" end="00:33:57.309" style="s2">slightly better than the competition and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">better and other avenues is that still a</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.309" end="00:34:00.910" style="s2">negating factor or is it sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:02.679" style="s2">full package like okay you slavery but</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.910" end="00:34:03.970" style="s2">use half the amount of slavery and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.679" end="00:34:06.520" style="s2">other people you actually you know in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.970" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">you introduced some some good paying</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.520" end="00:34:11.169" style="s2">jobs so it is still slavery and there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:12.580" style="s2">still some pollution but it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.169" end="00:34:15.369" style="s2">than the alternatives you know by at</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.580" end="00:34:18.010" style="s2">least twice is that still a deal-breaker</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.369" end="00:34:20.619" style="s2">to me it&#39;s not to me it&#39;s right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.010" end="00:34:23.159" style="s2">talked about that yeah we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.619" end="00:34:25.300" style="s2">transition the game be so if our</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.159" end="00:34:28.679" style="s2">requirements is at every project be</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.300" end="00:34:31.450" style="s2">perfect then we&#39;ll never get in there I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.679" end="00:34:32.980" style="s2">mean the one thing that I&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.450" end="00:34:35.859" style="s2">sure how to word this is something about</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.980" end="00:34:37.840" style="s2">like where the profit goes I think if</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.859" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">the profit goes to shareholders so I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.840" end="00:34:41.919" style="s2">like I think that&#39;s what one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:45.010" style="s2">really bad parts about current</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.919" end="00:34:46.840" style="s2">capitalism is the whole like yet being</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.010" end="00:34:49.000" style="s2">paid out to shareholders but more</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.840" end="00:34:50.200" style="s2">importantly that that&#39;s the driving</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.000" end="00:34:52.659" style="s2">factor the end-all-be-all</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.200" end="00:34:55.119" style="s2">and all decisions must support that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.659" end="00:34:57.010" style="s2">think tip like some version of that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.119" end="00:35:01.270" style="s2">one of the the deal-breakers because</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.010" end="00:35:03.390" style="s2">that drives bad decisions yes although</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.270" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">if you if you&#39;re not giving project</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.390" end="00:35:10.540" style="s2">profit to shareholders they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:12.970" style="s2">shareholders right so it might just be</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.540" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">having shareholders yeah okay I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.970" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">there are some there are or you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:19.750" style="s2">constituents or you have yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:21.490" style="s2">can own a share of the company and there</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.750" end="00:35:25.900" style="s2">not be any profits as long as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.490" end="00:35:27.880" style="s2">okay with that or dividend so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.900" end="00:35:30.940" style="s2">like you can have stakeholders but not</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.880" end="00:35:33.070" style="s2">shareholders that might be something to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.940" end="00:35:35.470" style="s2">consider and then we do need to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.070" end="00:35:39.160" style="s2">work on how do you get people to invest</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.470" end="00:35:42.609" style="s2">in these things which you know values</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.160" end="00:35:44.410" style="s2">not just in dollars so people can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.609" end="00:35:47.560" style="s2">investing in that to have a better world</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.410" end="00:35:49.600" style="s2">right and and maybe there are models</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.560" end="00:35:52.330" style="s2">where there are dividends based on</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.600" end="00:35:57.819" style="s2">investments it&#39;s just they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.330" end="00:35:59.979" style="s2">main purpose it isn&#39;t being a staple</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.819" end="00:36:02.469" style="s2">that everyone that&#39;s got something to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.979" end="00:36:04.809" style="s2">with the business and what up yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.469" end="00:36:05.410" style="s2">not what they for goodness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.809" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.410" end="00:36:11.140" style="s2">yes I&#39;m separating stakeholders from</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:12.309" style="s2">shareholders I stakeholder is somebody</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.140" end="00:36:14.319" style="s2">who&#39;s sort of interests that or has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.309" end="00:36:16.569" style="s2">vote you have to have those or in theory</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.319" end="00:36:18.789" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s normal but the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.569" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">shareholder because as Bentley said if</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.789" end="00:36:20.979" style="s2">you aren&#39;t getting paid up from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">profit but you&#39;re not really a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.979" end="00:36:25.569" style="s2">shareholder so because at first I said</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:27.609" style="s2">no shareholders and then we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.569" end="00:36:29.529" style="s2">that you know that separation so it</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.609" end="00:36:31.630" style="s2">might end up being you can still have</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.529" end="00:36:33.849" style="s2">stakeholders right so in like an an</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.630" end="00:36:35.709" style="s2">employee owned co-op your stakeholders</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.849" end="00:36:39.219" style="s2">are the employees a consumer own co-op</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.709" end="00:36:41.799" style="s2">your stakeholders are the consumers but</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.219" end="00:36:43.719" style="s2">in this the end goal is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.799" end="00:36:46.089" style="s2">about being a shareholder it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.719" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">having everything be profit driven where</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.089" end="00:36:49.869" style="s2">the end-all be-all is anybody that paid</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:57.219" style="s2">money in wants their maximum investment</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.869" end="00:36:58.630" style="s2">out it&#39;s just when them I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.219" end="00:37:01.449" style="s2">involved with things and they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.630" end="00:37:03.940" style="s2">talking about stakeholders he just just</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.449" end="00:37:06.729" style="s2">meant so it wasn&#39;t just the employees or</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.940" end="00:37:09.249" style="s2">the coop owners so whatever yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.729" end="00:37:12.279" style="s2">everything from the customer so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.249" end="00:37:13.779" style="s2">supplier you know I mean that was that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.279" end="00:37:15.430" style="s2">was all of us I was thinking you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.779" end="00:37:17.559" style="s2">and some of them didn&#39;t have any you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.430" end="00:37:19.299" style="s2">know it means so that&#39;s what anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.559" end="00:37:21.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved in that&#39;s what&#39;s they</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.299" end="00:37:23.469" style="s2">called he said stakeholders what</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.160" end="00:37:25.479" style="s2">everything you know I mean from anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.469" end="00:37:28.229" style="s2">anyone who has any interactions with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.479" end="00:37:32.259" style="s2">business with the stakeholder</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.229" end="00:37:34.269" style="s2">even in a consumer own co-op the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.259" end="00:37:35.859" style="s2">employees and the partners are still</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.269" end="00:37:37.269" style="s2">stakeholders because they sort of have</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.859" end="00:37:40.029" style="s2">something they might not be a voting</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.269" end="00:37:41.380" style="s2">stakeholder but they are stakeholder in</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.029" end="00:37:46.509" style="s2">the neighborhood and all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.380" end="00:37:51.819" style="s2">neighborhood Leo wrote out what we asked</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.509" end="00:37:53.769" style="s2">him to write up so that we all said the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.819" end="00:37:55.959" style="s2">government government around the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.769" end="00:37:58.059" style="s2">use the system to prevent corruption and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.959" end="00:37:59.920" style="s2">people taking control so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.059" end="00:38:02.499" style="s2">develop a framework based on that to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:04.660" style="s2">increase democracy inside the coop as I</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.499" end="00:38:06.519" style="s2">posted on the group is that we usually</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.660" end="00:38:08.589" style="s2">have three powers that are independent</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.519" end="00:38:10.910" style="s2">and harmonious the first power is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.589" end="00:38:14.450" style="s2">people involved they vote on an app</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.910" end="00:38:17.319" style="s2">they can they also can dispose the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.450" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">executive the executive is elected Home</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.319" end="00:38:21.740" style="s2">Depot&#39;s thank you thank you for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:24.440" style="s2">executive is elected and they are</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.740" end="00:38:27.289" style="s2">responsible to administer administrate</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.440" end="00:38:29.539" style="s2">the coop the third power is there is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.289" end="00:38:31.190" style="s2">judge and their job is to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.539" end="00:38:32.839" style="s2">principles and constitution of the coop</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.190" end="00:38:39.160" style="s2">and they prevent malicious like slavery</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.839" end="00:38:42.859" style="s2">from happening so just also to know Leo</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.160" end="00:38:44.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re able to come for</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.859" end="00:38:49.819" style="s2">the roundtable tomorrow morning which no</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.960" end="00:38:51.049" style="s2">is like in 21 hours or so because that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.819" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">is maybe you could be in the hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.049" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">and we can talk about the coop and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:58.549" style="s2">that that is as part of it and because</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:00.799" style="s2">because what my response to this is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.549" end="00:39:03.140" style="s2">like coops are democratic and they do</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.799" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">mimic the government&#39;s and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.140" end="00:39:07.069" style="s2">time to do one as the government would</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:09.829" style="s2">like this is already kind of failing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.069" end="00:39:11.799" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like why not play with it</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.829" end="00:39:14.089" style="s2">like why do you need the executives and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.799" end="00:39:17.029" style="s2">that because I don&#39;t think that is how</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.089" end="00:39:19.430" style="s2">coops necessarily operate but if it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.029" end="00:39:21.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason for that for that piece</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.430" end="00:39:23.329" style="s2">to be part of it then playing with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.740" end="00:39:24.769" style="s2">is playing with it on a smaller scale</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.329" end="00:39:26.900" style="s2">and said a lot a bigger scale and fight</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.769" end="00:39:28.430" style="s2">you know how to make that work as the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.900" end="00:39:30.140" style="s2">three executive branches I can never</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.430" end="00:39:36.170" style="s2">remember our legislative executive and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.140" end="00:39:37.640" style="s2">judicial okay quite okay yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.170" end="00:39:39.950" style="s2">part of it might end up being like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.640" end="00:39:42.289" style="s2">almost a translation into this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.950" end="00:39:44.029" style="s2">model so the executive wouldn&#39;t be it</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.289" end="00:39:46.069" style="s2">like a normal executive that that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.029" end="00:39:49.190" style="s2">think about especially in something like</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.069" end="00:39:52.220" style="s2">a liquid democracy where they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.190" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">easily depose the executive you know you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.220" end="00:39:55.640" style="s2">vote together and say that person seems</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:58.009" style="s2">to have the right idea that they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.640" end="00:40:00.380" style="s2">know they&#39;re making some good claims so</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.009" end="00:40:01.849" style="s2">we put them in power but then as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.380" end="00:40:03.650" style="s2">they start like oh nope they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.849" end="00:40:05.769" style="s2">doing that or you know they are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.650" end="00:40:08.089" style="s2">doing it but they&#39;re also completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.769" end="00:40:10.609" style="s2">violating our charter you can kick them</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.089" end="00:40:12.019" style="s2">out the next day and it&#39;s not like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.609" end="00:40:13.849" style="s2">you know in current governments where</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.019" end="00:40:15.259" style="s2">you can lie to get in power and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.849" end="00:40:17.150" style="s2">can do whatever the hell you want for</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.259" end="00:40:19.420" style="s2">the next four years and who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.150" end="00:40:19.420" style="s2">stop you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.970" end="00:40:27.310" style="s2">I do think that sort of top-down like if</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.630" end="00:40:29.829" style="s2">they&#39;re being true to their word and</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.310" end="00:40:31.420" style="s2">trying to to to get there there is some</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.829" end="00:40:33.069" style="s2">advantage into saying I&#39;m gonna pick</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.420" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">that person because they seem like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.069" end="00:40:36.940" style="s2">know they have a vision and you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:38.230" style="s2">of voting on the full package like what</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.940" end="00:40:39.970" style="s2">we talked about with you can&#39;t just vote</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.230" end="00:40:42.400" style="s2">on low prices and no slavery in this and</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.970" end="00:40:43.480" style="s2">that is some of them are in conflict so</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.400" end="00:40:45.130" style="s2">if you have people saying here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.480" end="00:40:46.810" style="s2">vision I have we&#39;re gonna have no</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.130" end="00:40:48.369" style="s2">slavery and try to pay people well and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.810" end="00:40:51.310" style="s2">keep prices here and have this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.369" end="00:40:53.050" style="s2">model then you can say yep that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.310" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">sounds good and then if either a they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.050" end="00:40:57.490" style="s2">failing or B is you know weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">entirely truthful about maybe some of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.490" end="00:41:01.480" style="s2">the stuff that they were doing you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:03.520" style="s2">have to wait for that to run its course</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.480" end="00:41:06.760" style="s2">you can say nope that&#39;s not working you</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.520" end="00:41:08.470" style="s2">aren&#39;t doing what what you said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.760" end="00:41:12.220" style="s2">going to depose you as soon as possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.470" end="00:41:13.900" style="s2">and replace you with somebody else yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.220" end="00:41:15.910" style="s2">I guess it&#39;d be interesting in that if</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.900" end="00:41:19.660" style="s2">we cover it tomorrow to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.910" end="00:41:22.690" style="s2">bylaws are for that co-op because that</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.660" end="00:41:24.970" style="s2">what you&#39;re describing is well I guess</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.690" end="00:41:27.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not that standard to have like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.970" end="00:41:29.800" style="s2">legislative plan to no co-op I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.010" end="00:41:31.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s usually just a board that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.800" end="00:41:36.210" style="s2">like the board elects the CEO or</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.720" end="00:41:36.210" style="s2">whatever the equivalent is the CEO and</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.869" end="00:41:44.650" style="s2">and the members get to vote on yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.400" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">who&#39;s on the board in its rotating over</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.650" end="00:41:49.720" style="s2">to a year to two years four years if the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:52.359" style="s2">members can depose people they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.720" end="00:41:56.410" style="s2">become the judicial branch where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.359" end="00:41:59.530" style="s2">like you have your your charter and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.410" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">say I here&#39;s the rules that viola is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.530" end="00:42:03.400" style="s2">waving at something I&#39;m not sure Souter</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:10.200" style="s2">type something out or what&#39;s going on or</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.400" end="00:42:12.609" style="s2">if he&#39;s swatting a fly but I think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.200" end="00:42:15.369" style="s2">hearing out because I mean I&#39;m fairly</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.609" end="00:42:18.310" style="s2">familiar with coops not as familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.369" end="00:42:20.410" style="s2">our government but between us pretty</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.310" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">sure all this yeah the other caution is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.410" end="00:42:25.660" style="s2">that allows the government models are</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">great in theory but no one likes the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.660" end="00:42:30.579" style="s2">government so no one thinks the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:32.530" style="s2">government is performing well so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.579" end="00:42:34.750" style="s2">sure if that&#39;s the best place to start</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.530" end="00:42:35.650" style="s2">well it&#39;s also like we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.750" end="00:42:37.810" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.650" end="00:42:39.790" style="s2">we met and that members then go off and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.810" end="00:42:41.700" style="s2">go to Walmart which honestly we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.790" end="00:42:44.710" style="s2">want to do but we do it based on price</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.700" end="00:42:47.170" style="s2">part of that is that we know what Mex</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.710" end="00:42:49.540" style="s2">stands for and it&#39;s beautiful but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.170" end="00:42:51.370" style="s2">can&#39;t afford it and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.540" end="00:42:52.690" style="s2">gonna break down and I&#39;m not gonna feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.370" end="00:42:53.620" style="s2">as guilty bringing it back to Walmart as</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.690" end="00:42:56.200" style="s2">I bring it back here</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.620" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">but my point is the ecosystem in which</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.200" end="00:43:00.520" style="s2">meth is involved in is Walmart is all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:05.310" style="s2">this right including the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.520" end="00:43:07.570" style="s2">everything else that well creating those</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.310" end="00:43:09.520" style="s2">whatever you call the mineral packages</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.570" end="00:43:12.460" style="s2">like like you&#39;re voting on on are we</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:14.530" style="s2">doing this are we doing that also making</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.460" end="00:43:16.150" style="s2">sure that that&#39;s visible for things like</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.530" end="00:43:18.670" style="s2">Walmart right and I don&#39;t think MEC</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.150" end="00:43:20.590" style="s2">could legally do that but we can write</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.670" end="00:43:22.450" style="s2">like it&#39;s like if we&#39;re essentially for</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.590" end="00:43:23.710" style="s2">a mega consumer cooperative like hey if</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.450" end="00:43:25.600" style="s2">my choice if I&#39;m telling you I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.710" end="00:43:28.330" style="s2">shopping at Mack because Walmart cheap</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.600" end="00:43:29.650" style="s2">birth then what we want is a consumer</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.330" end="00:43:31.600" style="s2">basis to know when it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.650" end="00:43:33.340" style="s2">shop at Walmart and when and I want it</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.600" end="00:43:35.890" style="s2">like what is what are their people</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.340" end="00:43:37.890" style="s2">getting paid the whole supply chain and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.890" end="00:43:40.810" style="s2">whatever is available putting that into</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.890" end="00:43:42.610" style="s2">yes on that note and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.810" end="00:43:44.080" style="s2">I do a lot of people disagree with but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.610" end="00:43:46.900" style="s2">think that competition is important even</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.080" end="00:43:48.580" style="s2">in game B because it like if you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.900" end="00:43:50.920" style="s2">have for example three different lines</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.580" end="00:43:52.690" style="s2">at MEC one is sort of the high end like</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.920" end="00:43:53.890" style="s2">that top or the top it&#39;s got everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.690" end="00:43:55.660" style="s2">that you want but you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.890" end="00:43:57.970" style="s2">afford it and then something that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:43:59.590" style="s2">tries to compete with Walmart but while</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.970" end="00:44:01.450" style="s2">saying it&#39;s not going to be as good as</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.590" end="00:44:03.370" style="s2">the upper line but our goal is to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.450" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">better in every avenue that we can right</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.370" end="00:44:07.690" style="s2">so not no slavery but less slavery not</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:09.220" style="s2">no pollution but less pollution so you</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.690" end="00:44:10.870" style="s2">can say if you were going to shop there</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.220" end="00:44:12.670" style="s2">comes up here instead the price is</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.870" end="00:44:14.200" style="s2">comparable but because we aren&#39;t paying</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.670" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">out shareholders massive you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.200" end="00:44:18.220" style="s2">executive bonuses and all the stuff it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:21.490" style="s2">is still going to be better hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.220" end="00:44:22.570" style="s2">yeah and then you can start to to manage</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.490" end="00:44:23.770" style="s2">those separately and they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.570" end="00:44:26.500" style="s2">competing with each other technically</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.770" end="00:44:29.260" style="s2">and you could have you could have no</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.500" end="00:44:31.210" style="s2">slavery and no things but have just the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.260" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">lower quality products because sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.210" end="00:44:35.770" style="s2">you don&#39;t need something that lasts a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:39.000" style="s2">lifetime which so I don&#39;t know if they</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.770" end="00:44:39.000" style="s2">have that or not yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.130" end="00:44:46.270" style="s2">so yeah so we could finish guessing</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.660" end="00:44:53.380" style="s2">Leo&#39;s report more comments go ahead much</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.270" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">ish because no competition that means</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.380" end="00:44:58.570" style="s2">also no challenge to the status quo</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:45:01.590" style="s2">which means if we have a product like an</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.570" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">aqueducts in ancient Rome and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.590" end="00:45:06.820" style="s2">underperforming it&#39;s not the best that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:07.450" style="s2">can be or it was the best when it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.820" end="00:45:11.770" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.450" end="00:45:16.330" style="s2">but then competition also means to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.770" end="00:45:19.270" style="s2">that someone comes along and sees</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.330" end="00:45:21.670" style="s2">potential for improvement and the way to</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.270" end="00:45:24.790" style="s2">improve India is to make something</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.670" end="00:45:27.640" style="s2">better and sell it for enough profit so</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.790" end="00:45:34.030" style="s2">the better thing replaces at least or at</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.640" end="00:45:36.250" style="s2">least that&#39;s the scary replaces the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.030" end="00:45:39.160" style="s2">previous thing so there is nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.250" end="00:45:44.350" style="s2">maybe not in competition but being able</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.160" end="00:45:45.550" style="s2">to change in meaningful way what is now</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.350" end="00:45:49.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve something that is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.550" end="00:45:53.500" style="s2">better so this kind of competition but</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.000" end="00:45:55.330" style="s2">you know a big difference yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.500" end="00:45:56.860" style="s2">that&#39;s why they use the word rivalry is</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.330" end="00:45:57.430" style="s2">rather competition they are slightly</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.860" end="00:45:59.830" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.430" end="00:46:01.480" style="s2">right yes I like that separation because</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.830" end="00:46:02.980" style="s2">I think the virus is where it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.480" end="00:46:05.230" style="s2">more heated and it&#39;s a bit like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.980" end="00:46:08.170" style="s2">trying to shut you down as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.230" end="00:46:10.270" style="s2">like in theory my project and Bethany&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.170" end="00:46:12.040" style="s2">project are kind of in competition but</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.270" end="00:46:13.390" style="s2">we&#39;re working together because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.040" end="00:46:16.360" style="s2">still trying to achieve the same goals</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.390" end="00:46:18.430" style="s2">so it&#39;s like and that&#39;s where I put in</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.360" end="00:46:19.930" style="s2">the private co-op petition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.430" end="00:46:22.090" style="s2">actually a term that like I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.930" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">trying to use to try to explain what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.090" end="00:46:26.770" style="s2">think it should end up being which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:28.900" style="s2">like it could be that reason the score</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.770" end="00:46:30.370" style="s2">takes off and wiki election falls flat</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.900" end="00:46:32.710" style="s2">or wiki election takes off and reasons</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.370" end="00:46:34.570" style="s2">card falls flat but Bentley and I are</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.710" end="00:46:37.450" style="s2">still trying to sort of solve that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.570" end="00:46:38.980" style="s2">problem together as much as possible to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.450" end="00:46:40.750" style="s2">sort of have that chat on what do we</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.980" end="00:46:43.840" style="s2">think the challenges are and how would</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.750" end="00:46:45.400" style="s2">each one of us try to resolve that and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.840" end="00:46:46.810" style="s2">might give him an idea for reasons core</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.400" end="00:46:47.890" style="s2">or he might give me an idea for wiki</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.810" end="00:46:49.900" style="s2">election that the other one of us</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.890" end="00:46:52.510" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do but because our end goals</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.900" end="00:46:53.950" style="s2">are the same and that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.510" end="00:46:55.869" style="s2">like all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.950" end="00:46:57.910" style="s2">I want to absorb a reason score or</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.869" end="00:47:00.010" style="s2">reason score absorbs wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.910" end="00:47:01.380" style="s2">unless like that makes sense because</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.010" end="00:47:03.849" style="s2">part of the goal is to have them</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.380" end="00:47:05.800" style="s2">separate so they are doing completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.849" end="00:47:07.540" style="s2">different things towards the same goal</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.800" end="00:47:10.510" style="s2">like having the three different product</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.540" end="00:47:11.680" style="s2">lines at Mac where you actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.510" end="00:47:13.810" style="s2">keep them separate and up one of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.680" end="00:47:15.579" style="s2">fails okay why did it fail should we</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.810" end="00:47:17.260" style="s2">replace it with something else does it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.579" end="00:47:19.570" style="s2">not make sense to have three but like</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.260" end="00:47:22.329" style="s2">probably having to in most cases is sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.570" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">of the bare minimum in my mind unless</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.329" end="00:47:27.430" style="s2">you know it&#39;s unless one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:28.660" style="s2">selling ninety nine percent it meets</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.430" end="00:47:30.099" style="s2">that the goals are like oh it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.660" end="00:47:34.329" style="s2">we might actually be able to get away</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.099" end="00:47:36.010" style="s2">with one I think two Matus this point if</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.329" end="00:47:37.839" style="s2">later on somebody else has I have a new</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.010" end="00:47:39.670" style="s2">idea they&#39;re welcome to start it up and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.839" end="00:47:41.619" style="s2">see if it competes and then if it starts</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.670" end="00:47:43.329" style="s2">to get traction and people start to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.619" end="00:47:48.910" style="s2">switch over cool we just found something</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.329" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">better to mention the again the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.910" end="00:47:53.619" style="s2">ecosystem of like I know Adriel and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.060" style="s2">Bentley and I&#39;m all good with them</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.619" end="00:47:56.500" style="s2">coming together and either creating</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.060" end="00:47:59.260" style="s2">something or wiki election being the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.500" end="00:48:02.440" style="s2">thing or a reason score but as a third</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.260" end="00:48:04.180" style="s2">party who doesn&#39;t know that sounds if</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.440" end="00:48:06.220" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand what cooperation is</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.180" end="00:48:07.720" style="s2">and what rivalries this is it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.220" end="00:48:09.160" style="s2">like collusion right it&#39;s like well how</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.720" end="00:48:10.869" style="s2">do I trust either of you if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.160" end="00:48:13.329" style="s2">and part of that is the transparency of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.869" end="00:48:16.900" style="s2">like you can see it you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.329" end="00:48:18.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case and if you can fully</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.900" end="00:48:20.560" style="s2">see what wiki elections doing and fully</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.760" end="00:48:22.300" style="s2">see what recent score is doing and know</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.560" end="00:48:27.400" style="s2">that you guys aren&#39;t in cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.300" end="00:48:28.750" style="s2">together then there is a beauty to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.400" end="00:48:30.609" style="s2">but I just want to own that like people</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.750" end="00:48:32.220" style="s2">coming in third party it&#39;s like sounds</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.609" end="00:48:36.040" style="s2">like if they can&#39;t like that absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.220" end="00:48:38.349" style="s2">I&#39;m talking a good poem like no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.040" end="00:48:41.339" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole other level of monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.349" end="00:48:45.069" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.339" end="00:48:47.950" style="s2">collusion isn&#39;t collusion unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.069" end="00:48:50.380" style="s2">you have a profit motive or some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.950" end="00:48:54.010" style="s2">motive that&#39;s not doing what&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.380" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">right for the external people so because</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.010" end="00:48:59.310" style="s2">we can&#39;t you know occlusions I guess</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:03.099" style="s2">technical inclusion if you&#39;re extracting</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.310" end="00:49:05.170" style="s2">from these your customers I think or</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.099" end="00:49:06.550" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the way it means whether</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.170" end="00:49:07.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the actual definition of the word</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.550" end="00:49:10.930" style="s2">that&#39;s the way it&#39;s use so</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.780" end="00:49:13.660" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting concept but and my</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.930" end="00:49:16.210" style="s2">please like the customer the person to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.660" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">use either of those things doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.210" end="00:49:21.400" style="s2">to know what collusion actually is right</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">so like just the idea you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.400" end="00:49:25.750" style="s2">talking to each other behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:27.610" style="s2">could be enough for them to think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.750" end="00:49:29.080" style="s2">something like collusion and be like</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.610" end="00:49:30.790" style="s2">wait how do I trust you then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.080" end="00:49:32.950" style="s2">Zuckerberg and whoever making things</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.790" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">decisions behind instead of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.950" end="00:49:35.230" style="s2">which is like right but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:36.910" style="s2">profit motive</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.230" end="00:49:38.920" style="s2">what are we cluding on getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.910" end="00:49:41.710" style="s2">information in the hands of the people</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.920" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">oh no and that&#39;s part of yeah and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.710" end="00:49:45.190" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be correct you just have</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:47.590" style="s2">to avoid the appearance of even doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.190" end="00:49:49.090" style="s2">that and you&#39;re right that transparency</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.590" end="00:49:50.530" style="s2">goes a long way towards that like being</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.090" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">fully transparent about our</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.530" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">conversations you know with these</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.000" end="00:49:55.930" style="s2">councils working together where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:58.300" style="s2">cooperating but competing and then also</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.930" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">having like being very open and vocal</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.300" end="00:50:01.600" style="s2">about what&#39;s different about these</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:03.370" style="s2">organizations where that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.600" end="00:50:06.970" style="s2">good thing like not having shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.370" end="00:50:07.960" style="s2">and like we aren&#39;t like any money that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.970" end="00:50:10.050" style="s2">comes out of this just goes into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.960" end="00:50:12.820" style="s2">organization to help grow it we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.050" end="00:50:14.830" style="s2">fattening our paychecks by having you</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.820" end="00:50:16.510" style="s2">know our project take off even more that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.830" end="00:50:19.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t personally enrich us there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.510" end="00:50:20.470" style="s2">reason to do it except getting more</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.180" end="00:50:23.140" style="s2">users on our platforms which of course</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.470" end="00:50:26.140" style="s2">is our goal and that&#39;s fine as long as</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.140" end="00:50:31.000" style="s2">as you said there&#39;s some facet of like</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.140" end="00:50:32.980" style="s2">not personally enriching yourself to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.000" end="00:50:34.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the main thing like and whether</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.980" end="00:50:36.310" style="s2">or not that&#39;s the real definition as</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.810" end="00:50:39.460" style="s2">Bentley said that&#39;s how people I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.310" end="00:50:40.690" style="s2">mostly think about it I think I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.460" end="00:50:43.210" style="s2">know why this is coming up in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.690" end="00:50:44.740" style="s2">but it there was just a Twitter thread</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.210" end="00:50:47.050" style="s2">where someone tried to cancel American</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.740" end="00:50:50.170" style="s2">Girl because they had a um a black doll</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.050" end="00:50:52.510" style="s2">there like a slave doll like wow and</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.510" end="00:50:56.170" style="s2">was specifically from this one tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.520" end="00:50:57.850" style="s2">they of course they tried to cancel it</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.170" end="00:50:58.870" style="s2">and the amount of the customers for</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.850" end="00:51:00.670" style="s2">American Girl who were like are you</p>

<p begin="00:51:02.500" end="00:51:06.040" style="s2">XY and Z and they consulted the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.390" end="00:51:09.310" style="s2">and the tribe said yes and they get the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.040" end="00:51:11.140" style="s2">money blankets it that having a loyal</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.310" end="00:51:13.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s American girl they&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.140" end="00:51:15.940" style="s2">co-op they&#39;re not not-for-profit but</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.930" end="00:51:17.890" style="s2">because they had created that brand and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.940" end="00:51:19.780" style="s2">people grew up with it and we&#39;re loyal</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.890" end="00:51:21.010" style="s2">to like they&#39;re like you can&#39;t disparage</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.780" end="00:51:21.520" style="s2">us because they understood it because</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.010" end="00:51:23.350" style="s2">they were part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.520" end="00:51:25.270" style="s2">story and I think that is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.350" end="00:51:27.610" style="s2">amount of protection and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.270" end="00:51:28.900" style="s2">wait a minute we I saw them have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.610" end="00:51:31.660" style="s2">conversations throughout the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.900" end="00:51:33.970" style="s2">and or at least heard whispers that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.660" end="00:51:36.070" style="s2">equipment I could go and watch it we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:51:38.050" end="00:51:42.850" style="s2">we are transparent also there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.460" end="00:51:44.290" style="s2">loyalty to the customer base that goes</p>

<p begin="00:53:02.850" end="00:53:14.460" style="s2">four o&#39;clock Leos time where would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:26.010" style="s2">the best place to get information for</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.460" end="00:53:27.450" style="s2">Leo coops and collectives and things</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.010" end="00:53:30.300" style="s2">that are running and things are being</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.450" end="00:53:33.030" style="s2">successful where would be the best place</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.300" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">to go we&#39;re getting half percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.030" end="00:53:40.200" style="s2">p2p foundation still one of the examples</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:42.150" style="s2">that I sort of just recently learned</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.200" end="00:53:44.760" style="s2">about and that Julie&#39;s has a long time</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.150" end="00:53:47.850" style="s2">it is Mondragon well that&#39;s been a co-op</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.760" end="00:53:48.660" style="s2">it&#39;s actually been very successful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.850" end="00:53:50.190" style="s2">actually now I think like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.660" end="00:53:53.220" style="s2">multi-billion dollar company that has a</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.190" end="00:53:56.730" style="s2">bunch of things underneath it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.220" end="00:53:59.040" style="s2">sure that you know I as beautiful as</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.730" end="00:54:01.140" style="s2">Mondragon is it started in the 50s and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.040" end="00:54:03.750" style="s2">like it started a long time ago and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.140" end="00:54:05.850" style="s2">to a certain quality it&#39;s you can&#39;t reap</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.750" end="00:54:07.380" style="s2">you can&#39;t recreate Mondragon it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.850" end="00:54:09.480" style="s2">going back and trying and looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.380" end="00:54:11.670" style="s2">would you start a new a new car company</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.480" end="00:54:14.900" style="s2">let&#39;s go look at Ford what did they do</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.670" end="00:54:17.250" style="s2">instead of like what did Tesla do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.900" end="00:54:18.360" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t look at how they started</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.250" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">but you might look at how they&#39;ve run</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.360" end="00:54:21.780" style="s2">now because that they&#39;re still operating</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:24.600" style="s2">in the current world or operating any</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.780" end="00:54:27.330" style="s2">game world giant monopolies like there</p>

<p begin="00:55:20.890" end="00:55:26.200" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m fairly knowledgeable and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.370" end="00:55:28.090" style="s2">coops not necessarily on I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.200" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">started one I&#39;ve worked at them I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.090" end="00:55:33.040" style="s2">shopped at them and I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:35.950" style="s2">them I mean creating the global</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.040" end="00:55:39.370" style="s2">cooperative global tech cooperative so</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.950" end="00:55:42.630" style="s2">I&#39;m open to questions and look forward</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.370" end="00:55:42.630" style="s2">to you&#39;ve been in the hot seats well</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.700" end="00:55:52.630" style="s2">does anyone have any closing closing</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.930" end="00:55:55.060" style="s2">statements for now what makes a game B</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.630" end="00:55:58.270" style="s2">project a project gave me just do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.060" end="00:55:59.980" style="s2">fail and help us all learn and like</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.270" end="00:56:01.960" style="s2">let&#39;s not use slavery but other than</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.980" end="00:56:04.060" style="s2">that let&#39;s just move forward and see is</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.960" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">it an improvement and as long as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.060" end="00:56:15.550" style="s2">transparent open I think one aspect that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:18.700" style="s2">I almost never heard about this is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.550" end="00:56:21.910" style="s2">ability for I now the project to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.700" end="00:56:26.460" style="s2">dissolved when it&#39;s done and completed</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.910" end="00:56:26.460" style="s2">and this is especially important because</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.490" end="00:56:33.670" style="s2">usually I really I mean always when</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.580" end="00:56:35.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem and a project arises</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.670" end="00:56:39.880" style="s2">to fix it</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.580" end="00:56:42.740" style="s2">it establishes it establishes itself as</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.880" end="00:56:47.390" style="s2">a thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.740" end="00:56:50.770" style="s2">company organizations of which the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.390" end="00:56:53.810" style="s2">problem potentially because exist at</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.770" end="00:56:57.310" style="s2">some amount of energy it has its</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.810" end="00:57:00.980" style="s2">diverted towards self-preservation and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.310" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">then it exists and it starts looking for</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.980" end="00:57:06.140" style="s2">other problems to solve and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:11.180" style="s2">necessarily the best it&#39;s like when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.140" end="00:57:12.650" style="s2">have a nail and you build a hammer to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.180" end="00:57:15.110" style="s2">whatever you want but then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.650" end="00:57:20.869" style="s2">hammer and then you look for other nails</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.110" end="00:57:24.350" style="s2">to look at problems as nice so you may</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.869" end="00:57:27.290" style="s2">end up applying the wrong tool to some</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.350" end="00:57:31.910" style="s2">problems that would be better if better</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.290" end="00:57:34.760" style="s2">fixed if a new tool was built and after</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.910" end="00:57:40.869" style="s2">the specific purpose ceased to exist</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.760" end="00:57:40.869" style="s2">so cease to exist along with it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.700" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">yeah I think that is like a bit prior to</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.730" end="00:57:55.250" style="s2">the antifragility conversation earlier</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:56.750" style="s2">with the game be overall should be</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.250" end="00:57:58.130" style="s2">antifragile but not the individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.750" end="00:57:59.510" style="s2">projects because they can be allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.130" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">fail and they should be allowed to fail</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.510" end="00:58:03.650" style="s2">a lot of key and a lot of them like</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:05.150" style="s2">should end up failing or dissolving or</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.650" end="00:58:07.070" style="s2">whatever like either they didn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.150" end="00:58:10.190" style="s2">or they did it and now they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.070" end="00:58:12.530" style="s2">to exist because or like they can still</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.190" end="00:58:14.030" style="s2">exist but at 1/10 of what it was because</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.530" end="00:58:15.770" style="s2">if you you know did a bunch of research</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.030" end="00:58:17.869" style="s2">to figure out how a hammer works and</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.770" end="00:58:19.100" style="s2">then you built it and you&#39;re like ok but</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.869" end="00:58:21.290" style="s2">now all we have to do is build them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.100" end="00:58:24.380" style="s2">maintain them 90% of this isn&#39;t needed</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.290" end="00:58:26.680" style="s2">anymore and that&#39;s where it probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.380" end="00:58:30.680" style="s2">helps have almost like I&#39;m parodies</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.680" end="00:58:32.060" style="s2">right and that&#39;s a it&#39;s kind of one of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.680" end="00:58:33.470" style="s2">the advantages of something like</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.060" end="00:58:36.440" style="s2">together Tech is you have that shared</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.470" end="00:58:37.910" style="s2">resource where it might be ok we put</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.440" end="00:58:40.700" style="s2">people on the hammer project they built</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.910" end="00:58:42.440" style="s2">one great now there&#39;s a small team that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.700" end="00:58:44.180" style="s2">that maintains that but then you move</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.440" end="00:58:45.770" style="s2">ninety percent of those people over to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.180" end="00:58:48.800" style="s2">different project hey now need a new</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.770" end="00:58:50.630" style="s2">screwdriver don&#39;t I think that it like</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.800" end="00:58:52.369" style="s2">having the conversation the beginning we</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.630" end="00:58:53.840" style="s2">are incorporating when you are is like</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.369" end="00:58:55.619" style="s2">when are we done when are we done that</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.840" end="00:58:57.029" style="s2">mission and sometimes like</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.619" end="00:58:59.460" style="s2">for the things I&#39;m doing the solution</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.029" end="00:59:01.920" style="s2">raising where it&#39;s like 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.460" end="00:59:03.359" style="s2">$100,000 now I&#39;m like great but when do</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.920" end="00:59:05.279" style="s2">you stop it right because the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.359" end="00:59:07.349" style="s2">the 10,000 frozen grows and grows but if</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.279" end="00:59:08.819" style="s2">we create a food one and then someone</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.349" end="00:59:10.259" style="s2">else creates one in ten years but</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.819" end="00:59:11.519" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a tiny group of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.259" end="00:59:12.900" style="s2">who are like Noah but I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.519" end="00:59:16.789" style="s2">want this one because it&#39;s the one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.900" end="00:59:19.049" style="s2">used to so what&#39;s the threshold that</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.789" end="00:59:21.630" style="s2">requires this for it to stay in</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.049" end="00:59:22.979" style="s2">existence it&#39;s definitely a cost - how</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.630" end="00:59:25.349" style="s2">long how much does it cost to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.979" end="00:59:26.339" style="s2">it and then you know if one person if</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.349" end="00:59:27.900" style="s2">it&#39;s costing you know you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.339" end="00:59:30.390" style="s2">your to maintain it know if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.900" end="00:59:33.029" style="s2">million people yeah we could probably do</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.390" end="00:59:35.910" style="s2">about anyway I just wanted to thank you</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.029" end="00:59:37.229" style="s2">it&#39;s part of something it&#39;s any other</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.910" end="00:59:39.900" style="s2">clothes he&#39;d say my support reason</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.229" end="00:59:43.049" style="s2">protocol that love which we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.900" end="00:59:47.190" style="s2">about here before it is also fits into</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.049" end="00:59:55.739" style="s2">that kind of governance I think all</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.190" end="00:59:57.089" style="s2">inputs of Linux alright thank you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.739" end="01:00:00.239" style="s2">everyone we&#39;ll see you tomorrow morning</p>
