<p begin="00:00:10.580" end="00:00:15.389" style="s2">one of the things that disturbs me about</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.259" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">our cultures is how sort of unprepared</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:22.050" style="s2">we are for tragedy in the sense like we</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:24.180" style="s2">were in a bad spot</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.050" end="00:00:27.000" style="s2">bad spot because because we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.180" end="00:00:28.500" style="s2">religion I mean I you know in the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.000" end="00:00:31.109" style="s2">people used to have really you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.500" end="00:00:34.950" style="s2">religion not without was you know you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.109" end="00:00:37.380" style="s2">needed that to deal with tragedy and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.950" end="00:00:39.629" style="s2">so again I guess it&#39;s education in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.380" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">time between worlds but you would almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.629" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">say religion in a time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">too I wonder I wonder if you know well</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:50.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong connection there I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">and I make it in the book</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.640" end="00:00:55.020" style="s2">pointing out basically pointing out that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.030" style="s2">if you if you take education the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.020" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">taking it and not making it just about</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.030" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">modern schooling but mind a broader yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:02.969" style="s2">and you look at what have been the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">successful educational adventures and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.969" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">organizations they the answer hands down</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:10.229" style="s2">is the religions like as far as</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.180" style="s2">facilitating intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">transmission of knowledge and skill and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.180" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">identity you know the religions are our</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">hand stand the largest most effective</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:27.090" style="s2">educational organizations ever and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">undeniable and I would argue in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.090" end="00:01:35.820" style="s2">that the the nature of what is discussed</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:40.500" style="s2">in religion right the topics of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.820" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">concern as Tillich would say that these</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.500" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">things are necessary as a part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">education that talking about death for</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">example yeah and it&#39;s absolutely taboo</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s more taboo in in modern</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">education and to discuss these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">things right well we separated church</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:01:59.969" style="s2">and state all right so again there was</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">progress in that move that separate</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.969" end="00:02:03.270" style="s2">church and state back to the 30 Years</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">War that was bad that was like religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s worse so after that happened</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:09.819" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay let&#39;s separate church</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:11.620" style="s2">and state</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.819" end="00:02:14.920" style="s2">also the fact that there&#39;s so much dead</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.620" end="00:02:16.629" style="s2">religion around you know it&#39;s not living</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.920" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">religion it&#39;s just it&#39;s just the corpse</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.629" end="00:02:24.159" style="s2">of a religion like right one and exactly</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">so real living religion needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.159" end="00:02:29.739" style="s2">part of education or else people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2">form identity well and if you don&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.739" end="00:02:36.099" style="s2">real living religion and I&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:38.739" style="s2">and with many broad connotations I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.099" end="00:02:41.169" style="s2">saying yeah I totally msync put prayer</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.739" end="00:02:42.459" style="s2">and school say yeah back to Catholic you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.169" end="00:02:44.139" style="s2">know not at all I&#39;m saying actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.459" end="00:02:45.700" style="s2">going the opposite those could be dead</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.139" end="00:02:47.650" style="s2">religions and that a living religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.700" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">might be something that we haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.650" end="00:02:51.909" style="s2">yet or a new cast of an existing</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:53.650" style="s2">tradition but certainly not what&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.909" end="00:02:56.230" style="s2">of sold in the marketplace as religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.650" end="00:02:59.349" style="s2">and that&#39;s why our identities are so odd</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.230" end="00:03:01.480" style="s2">and why many of your students would look</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.349" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">to superhero movies and Star Wars and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.480" end="00:03:06.189" style="s2">things like that for the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:10.840" style="s2">ideals by which they might craft</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.189" end="00:03:13.480" style="s2">themselves right and so the paucity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.840" end="00:03:17.099" style="s2">language of self evaluation the paucity</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.480" end="00:03:23.319" style="s2">of the language of strong evaluation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.099" end="00:03:24.819" style="s2">Kosmo imaginal frameworks makes it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.319" end="00:03:28.479" style="s2">that yeah there&#39;s a truncation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.819" end="00:03:31.870" style="s2">identity and and that leads to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.479" end="00:03:33.370" style="s2">D Skilling which is this that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.870" end="00:03:35.049" style="s2">not just that there&#39;s an incoherence of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.370" end="00:03:38.079" style="s2">how we make meaning of our identity in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.049" end="00:03:40.599" style="s2">our life and death and tragedy it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.079" end="00:03:42.609" style="s2">that lead that becomes incapacitating at</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.599" end="00:03:44.530" style="s2">the level of just like getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.609" end="00:03:47.319" style="s2">civilization to work and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.530" end="00:03:49.449" style="s2">that&#39;s where the trick is is that like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.319" end="00:03:54.699" style="s2">eventually with the mental health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.449" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">and other iatrogenic impacts of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.699" end="00:03:59.949" style="s2">of basically the totalized</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:02.169" style="s2">civilizational toxicity through put on</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.949" end="00:04:07.060" style="s2">the individual human body we end up in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.169" end="00:04:09.669" style="s2">situation where yeah we can&#39;t man can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.060" end="00:04:12.099" style="s2">man the machines we can&#39;t the women</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.669" end="00:04:14.169" style="s2">aren&#39;t teaching the kids and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.099" end="00:04:16.750" style="s2">longer maybe you want to explain that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.169" end="00:04:20.979" style="s2">term iectures Genesis I I can&#39;t even say</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.750" end="00:04:22.330" style="s2">it but hydrogenic yeah or Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.979" end="00:04:23.650" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think many people know</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.330" end="00:04:25.330" style="s2">this word</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.650" end="00:04:27.669" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a known word and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.330" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">think it&#39;s an important word you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.669" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">that people probably should know about</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:33.699" style="s2">absolutely yeah I mean I wish it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:35.830" style="s2">different word because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.699" end="00:04:37.870" style="s2">difficult word iatrogenic like it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.830" end="00:04:39.039" style="s2">that&#39;s I cannot use it again right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.870" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually a very important</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.039" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">concept personal to me which has to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:48.669" style="s2">with harm that it&#39;s done by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">being administered something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.669" end="00:04:54.310" style="s2">medicine that&#39;s supposed to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">harm right and so after genic</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.310" end="00:04:57.070" style="s2">technically means kind of harm done by a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:04:59.830" style="s2">doctor</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.070" end="00:05:03.250" style="s2">medically created disease medically</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.830" end="00:05:05.889" style="s2">created harm or injury Rossini&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.250" end="00:05:08.979" style="s2">and but the pattern you can see could</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.889" end="00:05:12.220" style="s2">apply more broadly where anytime there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.979" end="00:05:14.199" style="s2">a problem you try to fix the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.220" end="00:05:15.760" style="s2">the thing you&#39;re doing to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.199" end="00:05:18.039" style="s2">problem is actually making the problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.760" end="00:05:20.500" style="s2">worse like that you can see how that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.039" end="00:05:22.539" style="s2">general pattern so like you I argue in</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.500" end="00:05:24.460" style="s2">my first book that likes okay the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.539" end="00:05:27.099" style="s2">American schools were a problem so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.460" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">used standardized testing to try to fix</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.099" end="00:05:31.570" style="s2">that problem but standardized testing</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:33.699" style="s2">actually made the schools worse that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.570" end="00:05:35.770" style="s2">right right so that it was actually an</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.699" end="00:05:37.300" style="s2">iatrogenic effect and Ilic makes this</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.770" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">argument that there&#39;s multi-level</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.300" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">a-after genic impacts haven&#39;t into with</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">basically mechanical solutions aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:48.090" style="s2">organic problems and so medicines a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:51.220" style="s2">clear case but what&#39;s tricky is that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.090" end="00:05:54.010" style="s2">once you&#39;ve invested a lot in solving</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.220" end="00:05:56.139" style="s2">the problem that way you&#39;re also going</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.010" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">to be pretty invested in not detecting</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.139" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">the kinds of injury and harm that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:04.960" style="s2">doing yeah by virtue of trying to fix</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:07.630" style="s2">the problem and so that means that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.960" end="00:06:11.470" style="s2">hydrogenic effects are hard to detect</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.630" end="00:06:13.720" style="s2">and so when Ilic wrote about this in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.470" end="00:06:15.580" style="s2">medicine and the seven is he was already</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.720" end="00:06:19.930" style="s2">seeing things that have now mushroomed</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.580" end="00:06:21.220" style="s2">almost out of control and i believe we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.930" end="00:06:24.940" style="s2">are looking at something like an</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.220" end="00:06:26.710" style="s2">iatrogenic plague where a very large</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.940" end="00:06:30.370" style="s2">percentage of the populations of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.680" end="00:06:59.460" style="s2">people were saying oh he&#39;s he&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.810" end="00:07:01.200" style="s2">good or bad or they&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.460" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">discussion and you and you came in and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.200" end="00:07:05.730" style="s2">said you know the thing that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">with him right now is that this actual</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:17.940" style="s2">that&#39;s like his his his his massive fame</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.690" end="00:07:24.690" style="s2">and then and then and then suddenly sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.940" end="00:07:26.910" style="s2">of this this this tragedy happening that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.690" end="00:07:29.340" style="s2">is a kind of archetypal kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.910" end="00:07:33.390" style="s2">thing in some kind of a way I I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.390" end="00:07:40.370" style="s2">that makes any sense I mean it does and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.910" end="00:07:40.370" style="s2">I it&#39;s unfortunate in a sense because</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.640" end="00:07:47.430" style="s2">you know Peterson the polarization of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:48.510" style="s2">the polarizing nature of Peterson will</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.430" end="00:07:50.190" style="s2">make it so that people don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.510" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">pay attention to the after Jenna thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.190" end="00:07:56.280" style="s2">that&#39;s right in the face which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:58.860" style="s2">if you hate Peterson then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.280" end="00:08:00.150" style="s2">read him as an addict or try which means</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.860" end="00:08:01.740" style="s2">that you can&#39;t see that all he was doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.150" end="00:08:03.479" style="s2">was following doctor&#39;s orders and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.740" end="00:08:06.660" style="s2">actually that it was the drug that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.479" end="00:08:10.050" style="s2">extremely dangerous right if you love</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.660" end="00:08:11.910" style="s2">Peterson then you can&#39;t see that story</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.050" end="00:08:13.560" style="s2">that the drug was dangerous right</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.910" end="00:08:14.820" style="s2">because now you&#39;re actually critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.560" end="00:08:16.289" style="s2">the whole medical system and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.820" end="00:08:17.250" style="s2">critiquing his judgment taking the drug</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.289" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">in the first place and you&#39;re critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.250" end="00:08:21.930" style="s2">his prior statements about the validity</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.640" style="s2">of taking psychiatric medications right</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.930" end="00:08:27.390" style="s2">which are running on the assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.640" end="00:08:28.950" style="s2">they don&#39;t do harm and so if you love</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.390" end="00:08:30.330" style="s2">them you can&#39;t say the hydrogenic thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.950" end="00:08:31.530" style="s2">and if you hate it we can&#39;t stay at</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.330" end="00:08:32.849" style="s2">regenexx things are actually he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.530" end="00:08:36.930" style="s2">actually got to obscure the issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.849" end="00:08:41.050" style="s2">unfortunately and now I believe that an</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.930" end="00:08:43.060" style="s2">important class of drug namely benzos</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:45.190" style="s2">which should be understood as very</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.060" end="00:08:47.890" style="s2">dangerous to use not because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.190" end="00:08:51.070" style="s2">addictive but because they cause certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.890" end="00:08:53.170" style="s2">forms of brain damage that these will be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.070" end="00:08:57.130" style="s2">misunderstood as only bad because</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.170" end="00:08:59.950" style="s2">they&#39;re addictive and or misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.130" end="00:09:02.860" style="s2">as only rarely rarely rarely are bad</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.950" end="00:09:06.040" style="s2">right on the whole he made the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.860" end="00:09:07.779" style="s2">choice which is the two sides of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.040" end="00:09:12.040" style="s2">so I&#39;m actually quite upset about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.779" end="00:09:13.720" style="s2">because I I mean honestly have never</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.040" end="00:09:16.870" style="s2">paid much attention to Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.720" end="00:09:18.370" style="s2">tried and but now I have because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.870" end="00:09:20.440" style="s2">caught up in the hydrogenic plague which</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.370" end="00:09:23.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve been tracking and I&#39;m seeing them</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.440" end="00:09:24.490" style="s2">actually becoming a distraction from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.110" end="00:09:27.550" style="s2">plague that people are caught up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.490" end="00:09:29.860" style="s2">it&#39;s simulation and now I caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.550" end="00:09:32.230" style="s2">the reality and the reality is actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.860" end="00:09:36.220" style="s2">quite scary which is that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.230" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">extremely common for there to be very</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.220" end="00:09:40.510" style="s2">adverse side effects from taking</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:44.250" style="s2">psychiatric medications as prescribed</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.510" end="00:09:47.020" style="s2">those SSRIs and benzos</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.250" end="00:09:49.480" style="s2">that&#39;s benzos being things like adderall</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.020" end="00:09:53.560" style="s2">and klonopin and SSRIs things like you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.480" end="00:09:55.420" style="s2">know classically Prozac and now just by</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.560" end="00:09:57.910" style="s2">saying that I can be like I know victims</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.420" end="00:10:00.700" style="s2">of Prozac right yeah so just by saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.910" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">that I would be labeled by the American</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.700" end="00:10:04.810" style="s2">Psychiatric Association as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.079" end="00:10:06.760" style="s2">Scientologist probably and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.810" end="00:10:10.390" style="s2">anti-psychiatry movement but in fact I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.760" end="00:10:14.170" style="s2">not I&#39;m simply a reasonable person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.390" end="00:10:15.670" style="s2">looking at evidence and Jordan Pearson</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.170" end="00:10:18.040" style="s2">some of the evidence if you can look</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.670" end="00:10:20.200" style="s2">past the simulation and to the reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.040" end="00:10:22.570" style="s2">of what actually happened to the man now</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.200" end="00:10:26.050" style="s2">it&#39;s all second my friend Dave who&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.570" end="00:10:28.120" style="s2">his on dialysis you know because he took</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.050" end="00:10:30.459" style="s2">Prozac for I don&#39;t know 20 years he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.120" end="00:10:34.120" style="s2">missed and and spent 20 years in bed and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.459" end="00:10:35.260" style="s2">you know yeah yeah I mean it&#39;s I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.120" end="00:10:35.529" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people out there like</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.260" end="00:10:38.860" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.529" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">yeah there are I mean it&#39;s very you said</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.860" end="00:10:42.940" style="s2">plague that&#39;s a very strong word it</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:44.470" style="s2">takes a strong word but it&#39;s a specific</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.940" end="00:10:46.029" style="s2">word and again back to the thirty years</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.470" end="00:10:48.550" style="s2">were back to that period when there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.029" end="00:10:50.260" style="s2">also plagues as part of civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.550" end="00:10:52.740" style="s2">transition which had to do with rapid</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.260" end="00:10:54.360" style="s2">urbanization without adjustment now</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.740" end="00:10:58.620" style="s2">and playing that actually has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.360" end="00:11:00.570" style="s2">the side effects of the whole industrial</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.620" end="00:11:04.110" style="s2">system and a certain approach to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.570" end="00:11:05.430" style="s2">handling disease from the industry</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.110" end="00:11:11.970" style="s2">perspective and a petrochemical</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.430" end="00:11:14.250" style="s2">perspective and so yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.970" end="00:11:17.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a complexity to the plague which</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.250" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">means that it is arbitrarily hitting is</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.220" end="00:11:25.410" style="s2">spreading wide is destabilizing economic</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:28.350" style="s2">and geopolitical and we&#39;re approaching</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.410" end="00:11:33.029" style="s2">it and it&#39;s invisible because no one</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.350" end="00:11:36.060" style="s2">wants to talk about it and so yeah we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.029" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">see where it goes and so so by your what</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.060" end="00:11:43.410" style="s2">you&#39;re describing is people being taking</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:46.529" style="s2">drugs for psychiatric illnesses take</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.410" end="00:11:48.899" style="s2">taking bad drugs for it is that what</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.529" end="00:11:51.390" style="s2">you&#39;re describing because you are much</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.899" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">more than that I&#39;m describing basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.390" end="00:11:57.420" style="s2">the the entire industrial complex of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:12:00.180" style="s2">late capitalist medical system</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.420" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">disgusting okay so I&#39;m describing a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.180" end="00:12:05.550" style="s2">system that has young children on</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:09.570" style="s2">multiple drugs at unprecedented rates</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.550" end="00:12:12.990" style="s2">and old people over 60 so-called poly</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.570" end="00:12:16.730" style="s2">drugged at unprecedented rates none of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.990" end="00:12:20.910" style="s2">which has been studied negative effects</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.730" end="00:12:22.350" style="s2">already being documented it&#39;s um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.910" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">like a massive experiment on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.350" end="00:12:28.589" style="s2">population like I study ADHD medication</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">situation very carefully and so I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.589" end="00:12:34.230" style="s2">speak to that other people can speak to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:38.310" style="s2">some of the other issues but yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.230" end="00:12:41.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a massive experiment on the human</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.310" end="00:12:43.950" style="s2">nervous system and you say something</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.250" end="00:12:45.779" style="s2">about ADHD can you say something about</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.950" end="00:12:48.029" style="s2">that that&#39;s I mean we&#39;re back to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.779" end="00:12:49.709" style="s2">dyslexia that right so we are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.029" end="00:12:51.930" style="s2">a typical nervous systems like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.709" end="00:12:53.520" style="s2">looking at kids each kid having a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.930" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">different nervous system that&#39;s the max</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.520" end="00:13:00.510" style="s2">each kid actually has a profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:13:01.829" style="s2">unique nervous system thank God and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.510" end="00:13:03.390" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a situation where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.829" end="00:13:06.019" style="s2">unique nervous system doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.390" end="00:13:10.220" style="s2">necessarily fit well in the standard</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.019" end="00:13:11.749" style="s2">container then you either need to blame</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.220" end="00:13:15.800" style="s2">the container or blame the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.749" end="00:13:19.309" style="s2">system right so a lot of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.800" end="00:13:20.779" style="s2">happening with the ADHD kind of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.309" end="00:13:22.850" style="s2">and if you look at the numbers of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.779" end="00:13:24.649" style="s2">kind of escalating diagnosis and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.850" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">diagnostic creep and numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.649" end="00:13:30.350" style="s2">prescriptions it&#39;s a large large number</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:32.360" style="s2">of kids over a short period of time and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.350" end="00:13:34.519" style="s2">the numbers are actually my book I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.360" end="00:13:36.649" style="s2">document the actual numbers and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.519" end="00:13:39.009" style="s2">billion the billions being made by</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.649" end="00:13:41.420" style="s2">companies selling ritalin</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.009" end="00:13:44.929" style="s2">direct-to-consumer have that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.420" end="00:13:46.489" style="s2">that due to the united states and but</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.929" end="00:13:50.410" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking at is a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.489" end="00:13:55.639" style="s2">want to avert attention from critique of</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.390" end="00:15:30.350" style="s2">get them out of there because if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.620" end="00:15:33.470" style="s2">don&#39;t then we&#39;re just gonna ad DS just</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.470" end="00:15:36.890" style="s2">will keep increasing there we give them</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.890" end="00:15:41.420" style="s2">then they&#39;ll have reactions both of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.300" end="00:15:46.670" style="s2">those suicides right and so it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.420" end="00:15:49.220" style="s2">being yeah the the the kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.670" end="00:15:51.470" style="s2">the externalities of the system are</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.220" end="00:15:54.640" style="s2">being displaced into the bodies of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.470" end="00:15:56.690" style="s2">youth and when I talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.640" end="00:15:58.970" style="s2">catastrophic bifurcation of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.690" end="00:16:00.500" style="s2">intergenerational transmission being a</p>

<p begin="00:16:00.500" end="00:16:07.580" style="s2">collapse those oh yeah it ends up well</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.770" end="00:16:10.990" style="s2">you know yeah you know and it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.580" end="00:16:10.990" style="s2">of generational warfare action</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.490" end="00:16:17.450" style="s2">generational warfare I mean look at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.140" end="00:16:20.060" style="s2">debt look at the debt and then now look</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.450" end="00:16:22.310" style="s2">at the iatrogenic burden being placed on</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.060" end="00:16:26.090" style="s2">the youth like what are we gonna expect</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.310" end="00:16:27.740" style="s2">them to do and what are we gonna expect</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.090" end="00:16:33.950" style="s2">them to think of us for leaving them in</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.740" end="00:16:37.700" style="s2">this situation and so yeah so that feels</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.950" end="00:16:39.500" style="s2">to me like rough the plague is here</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.700" end="00:16:41.540" style="s2">basically is what you&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.500" end="00:16:43.870" style="s2">plague is here I&#39;m saying something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.540" end="00:16:48.770" style="s2">the plague is approaching and we&#39;ve and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.870" end="00:16:55.820" style="s2">we are the cause and therefore the cause</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.770" end="00:16:57.590" style="s2">is unspeakable and as a Rastafari none</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.820" end="00:17:00.050" style="s2">you said he said look how Babylon works</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.590" end="00:17:02.030" style="s2">the school&#39;s make you stupid the money</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.050" end="00:17:06.800" style="s2">makes you pour the medicine makes you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.030" end="00:17:09.680" style="s2">sick yeah right and so this is it the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.800" end="00:17:13.850" style="s2">system has reached a point where now it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.680" end="00:17:15.470" style="s2">is turning into its opposite right the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.850" end="00:17:16.910" style="s2">system has grown to a point where now</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.470" end="00:17:20.900" style="s2">its internal contradictions are</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.910" end="00:17:22.790" style="s2">beginning to dissolve it but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.900" end="00:17:24.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the good news is it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.790" end="00:17:27.980" style="s2">reached a level of toxicity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.920" end="00:17:30.500" style="s2">becoming transparent like you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.980" end="00:17:32.750" style="s2">I hope so but before you it was harder</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.500" end="00:17:34.070" style="s2">see well it&#39;s getting harder to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.750" end="00:17:35.900" style="s2">because we&#39;re compromising our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.070" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">systems as a result of a I&#39;d reject</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.900" end="00:17:41.510" style="s2">playing right so this is the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:43.160" style="s2">main problems you have with certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.510" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">forms of our Genesis is that they affect</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.160" end="00:17:46.280" style="s2">the nervous system precisely in such a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:49.310" style="s2">way that you can&#39;t recognize that your</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.280" end="00:17:53.000" style="s2">conference the people on the Senate</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.310" end="00:17:57.380" style="s2">floor I think think they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.000" end="00:17:59.570" style="s2">clearly like I don&#39;t think they know</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.380" end="00:18:02.560" style="s2">that they&#39;re well they&#39;re in the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.570" end="00:18:02.560" style="s2">so correct</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.740" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">do you expect them to do but but you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.020" end="00:18:15.050" style="s2">know programmed so you know in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:17.780" style="s2">of in the fog of the time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.050" end="00:18:24.920" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s dicey right down to the level</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.780" end="00:18:26.750" style="s2">of the biological substrate and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.920" end="00:18:29.540" style="s2">we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see but yes so the at row</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.750" end="00:18:33.710" style="s2">genic term is very important and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.540" end="00:18:35.780" style="s2">know hopefully another person or group</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.710" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">will somehow very attention to the issue</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.780" end="00:18:38.930" style="s2">that is known as polarizing peterson so</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:43.700" style="s2">people can actually look through the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.930" end="00:18:47.630" style="s2">simulation of the reality and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.700" end="00:18:50.990" style="s2">around so that&#39;s the one narrative you</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.630" end="00:18:52.850" style="s2">will see in the culture about problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.990" end="00:18:57.560" style="s2">with the medical industry you will see</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.850" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">the addiction and exactly a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.560" end="00:19:03.170" style="s2">interesting narrative because it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:05.930" style="s2">in a sense placing responsibility on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.170" end="00:19:10.430" style="s2">individual who is actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.930" end="00:19:12.940" style="s2">receiving end of the system right most</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.430" end="00:19:15.890" style="s2">of the so-called addicts even on opiates</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.940" end="00:19:18.170" style="s2">were placed on them as part of surgical</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.890" end="00:19:18.860" style="s2">procedure or some other normal thing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.170" end="00:19:21.050" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking at is actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.860" end="00:19:24.860" style="s2">something like physical dependency which</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.050" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">is different than the patient and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.860" end="00:19:29.180" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing that&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:34.370" style="s2">interference between culture actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.180" end="00:19:37.860" style="s2">seeing that regenexx addiction</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.370" end="00:19:46.590" style="s2">mm-hmm of course very dangerous to even</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.860" end="00:19:47.909" style="s2">talk about this stuff this one is used</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.590" end="00:19:48.870" style="s2">when you start to talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.909" end="00:19:50.570" style="s2">things you&#39;re now you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.870" end="00:19:53.429" style="s2">illness you&#39;re talking about death</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.570" end="00:19:54.450" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about fear mmm I talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.429" end="00:19:59.010" style="s2">about a lot of things that actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.450" end="00:20:03.630" style="s2">drive our behavior away from engaging</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.010" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">the truth I&#39;m very difficult that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.630" end="00:20:07.220" style="s2">conversation I&#39;m glad we&#39;re having it</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:13.799" style="s2">but I don&#39;t anticipate it being</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.220" end="00:20:15.809" style="s2">well-received that kind of ties in to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.799" end="00:20:17.970" style="s2">the next question that&#39;s that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.809" end="00:20:20.850" style="s2">to me and that is I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.970" end="00:20:22.260" style="s2">media and I have you know I said</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.850" end="00:20:24.899" style="s2">initially you had this resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.260" end="00:20:26.460" style="s2">doing a podcast and I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.899" end="00:20:29.399" style="s2">that and I was thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.460" end="00:20:31.500" style="s2">there&#39;s all these podcasts everywhere um</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.399" end="00:20:33.809" style="s2">and I was thinking about how odd and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.500" end="00:20:35.909" style="s2">strange and bizarre this even just this</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.809" end="00:20:39.000" style="s2">kind of conversation is right you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.909" end="00:20:41.279" style="s2">we&#39;ve got earphones on and talking into</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.000" end="00:20:43.559" style="s2">a microphone and and and you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.279" end="00:20:46.770" style="s2">Vermont and and I&#39;m in like Avon France</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.559" end="00:20:50.669" style="s2">and the whole thing is it&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.770" end="00:20:52.620" style="s2">and I&#39;ve noticed that you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.669" end="00:20:54.360" style="s2">know what kind of media I used to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.620" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">consume but I&#39;m listening to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.360" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">conversations you know on with on</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:01.500" style="s2">podcasts or even conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:05.850" style="s2">aren&#39;t even at the level of podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.500" end="00:21:08.549" style="s2">right just between people on YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.850" end="00:21:11.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very odd what&#39;s what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.549" end="00:21:14.730" style="s2">on the fuck is going on with media like</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.640" end="00:21:16.140" style="s2">what is happening to us like on one</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.730" end="00:21:19.020" style="s2">level I feel like I&#39;m learning all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.140" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">of shit right like I&#39;m getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.020" end="00:21:27.480" style="s2">information in the rabbit hole so to</p>

<p begin="00:21:27.480" end="00:21:36.149" style="s2">overwhelmed it does I mean I have very</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.620" end="00:21:40.110" style="s2">different media consumption habits I</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.149" end="00:21:42.900" style="s2">mostly read books I spend very little</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.110" end="00:21:45.420" style="s2">time looking at the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.900" end="00:21:47.970" style="s2">and almost no time listening to podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.420" end="00:21:51.240" style="s2">or watching YouTube videos what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.970" end="00:21:55.050" style="s2">happening is that the new point of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.240" end="00:21:59.670" style="s2">extraction in the global economy is now</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.050" end="00:22:03.420" style="s2">your attention and so where it used to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.670" end="00:22:06.930" style="s2">be a cultural industry was relatively</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.420" end="00:22:10.440" style="s2">benign interesting compliment to things</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.930" end="00:22:13.560" style="s2">like steel and automobiles now it is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.440" end="00:22:18.840" style="s2">case that the Society of the spectacle</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.560" end="00:22:27.450" style="s2">runs on mining for your attention down</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.840" end="00:22:29.430" style="s2">to the micro broadcaster and so a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.450" end="00:22:33.570" style="s2">bit about what even-even Ilic was</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.430" end="00:22:36.420" style="s2">talking about how we would move away</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.570" end="00:22:39.060" style="s2">from from from schooling good and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.420" end="00:22:40.920" style="s2">opening up this sort of infinite educate</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.060" end="00:22:43.670" style="s2">you said you&#39;re confused you said you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.920" end="00:22:46.530" style="s2">just know that it&#39;s weird and alienating</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.670" end="00:22:49.320" style="s2">it could move us away from schooling and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.530" end="00:22:51.870" style="s2">it could be the concrete utopian dream</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.320" end="00:22:56.100" style="s2">of the early 90s where the internet</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.870" end="00:22:59.570" style="s2">began but it&#39;s an information ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.100" end="00:23:01.530" style="s2">is not an educational environment and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.570" end="00:23:03.540" style="s2">occasionally and an informational</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.530" end="00:23:05.670" style="s2">ecosystem that runs on it says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.540" end="00:23:08.580" style="s2">little corners of the internet like of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.670" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">course if you&#39;re a society listening to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.580" end="00:23:12.810" style="s2">somebody listening to this could could</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:15.240" style="s2">could get a lot of fantastic information</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.810" end="00:23:18.270" style="s2">right I mean and somebody who&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.240" end="00:23:20.580" style="s2">not as educated in you as you are and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.270" end="00:23:21.960" style="s2">not as gifted at reading books because a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.580" end="00:23:24.090" style="s2">lot of people don&#39;t even read books</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.960" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">these are correct correct a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.090" end="00:23:28.650" style="s2">people don&#39;t even talk to other real</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:29.910" style="s2">people if there&#39;s a huge loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.650" end="00:23:31.650" style="s2">epidemic so the other thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.910" end="00:23:34.140" style="s2">happening is the screen capturing</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.650" end="00:23:38.970" style="s2">attention moving us away from one</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.140" end="00:23:41.100" style="s2">another and towards the images and so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.970" end="00:23:43.380" style="s2">believe educational technology digital</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.100" end="00:23:47.010" style="s2">technology networked computers could</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.380" end="00:23:48.990" style="s2">make Gillis&#39;s vision possible but not</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.010" end="00:23:50.370" style="s2">the way it&#39;s currently being used in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.990" end="00:23:52.440" style="s2">book I lay out specific design</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.370" end="00:23:54.270" style="s2">principles for educational technologies</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.440" end="00:23:55.690" style="s2">that would potentially meet these</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.270" end="00:23:57.519" style="s2">standards and they would</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.690" end="00:24:02.080" style="s2">always move you away from the screen</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.519" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">towards other people so that actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.080" end="00:24:06.129" style="s2">issue but even you know I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:08.830" style="s2">sort of happening already</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.129" end="00:24:11.350" style="s2">you know example for example a nun</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.830" end="00:24:14.409" style="s2">meeting Alexander in Paris tomorrow and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.350" end="00:24:16.809" style="s2">you know he came here and we&#39;re meeting</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.409" end="00:24:19.779" style="s2">and we we met online so so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.809" end="00:24:21.639" style="s2">like that&#39;s like a next step right it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.779" end="00:24:23.799" style="s2">and I&#39;m not the only thing that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.639" end="00:24:25.899" style="s2">the only one noticing this but you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.799" end="00:24:27.940" style="s2">to understand that YouTube in particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.899" end="00:24:30.700" style="s2">and a lot of in Facebook in particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.940" end="00:24:32.379" style="s2">and Twitter&#39;s in particular this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.700" end="00:24:34.149" style="s2">about attention capture and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.379" end="00:24:34.750" style="s2">making money off of capturing your</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.149" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.750" end="00:24:39.759" style="s2">sure period and and if we if we keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:41.019" style="s2">glossing it over and saying oh but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.759" end="00:24:43.149" style="s2">has the benefits and we should be on</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.019" end="00:24:45.100" style="s2">Facebook anyway it&#39;s like no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.149" end="00:24:47.500" style="s2">misunderstanding that&#39;s like the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.100" end="00:24:48.909" style="s2">smoking cigarettes in the 50s you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.500" end="00:24:50.620" style="s2">I&#39;m saying like no we know that this</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.909" end="00:24:53.019" style="s2">shit that&#39;s actually disrupting our</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.620" end="00:24:55.960" style="s2">ability to conduct ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.019" end="00:24:58.000" style="s2">civilized manner and we also notice that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.960" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">we&#39;re talking and and you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.000" end="00:25:01.929" style="s2">very interesting and something&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:05.019" style="s2">on at the same time I mean I I agree</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.929" end="00:25:07.509" style="s2">with you I you know I probably become an</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.019" end="00:25:10.379" style="s2">addict of some kinds you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.509" end="00:25:16.299" style="s2">probably need to wean it off it often</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.379" end="00:25:17.879" style="s2">but okay I mean and the long-form</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.299" end="00:25:20.440" style="s2">conversation what we&#39;re doing now is</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.879" end="00:25:22.629" style="s2">different than asynchronous text-based</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.440" end="00:25:25.029" style="s2">exchange right so asynchronous allow</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.629" end="00:25:27.129" style="s2">anonymous text based exchange like</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.029" end="00:25:30.070" style="s2">Facebook posts right yeah and Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.129" end="00:25:32.529" style="s2">feeds oh that&#39;s not even synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.070" end="00:25:35.620" style="s2">text-based like what like and that these</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.529" end="00:25:38.110" style="s2">things capture the amygdala and capture</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.620" end="00:25:40.509" style="s2">so much time and attention and as they</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.110" end="00:25:43.179" style="s2">entrap us in that they&#39;re selling</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.509" end="00:25:44.529" style="s2">advertisements next oh yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.179" end="00:25:47.379" style="s2">they&#39;re actually making money off of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.529" end="00:25:49.090" style="s2">their ability to capture they make the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.379" end="00:25:51.220" style="s2">look through asynchronous text base</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.090" end="00:25:54.309" style="s2">exchange with a stranger who could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.220" end="00:25:57.909" style="s2">here&#39;s the killer a robot and not even a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.309" end="00:25:58.840" style="s2">real person so it&#39;s like why do people</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.909" end="00:26:01.870" style="s2">who have better things that could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.840" end="00:26:05.590" style="s2">writing spend a ton of time writing</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.870" end="00:26:08.110" style="s2">they&#39;re working for Facebook and working</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.590" end="00:26:09.730" style="s2">for Twitter this is interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.110" end="00:26:12.310" style="s2">and again part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.730" end="00:26:13.900" style="s2">we are in the simulation and how far</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.310" end="00:26:15.430" style="s2">away we are from actually looking at</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.900" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.430" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">we&#39;re all an acid or something it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:23.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the culture has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:25.810" style="s2">given us the whole culture has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.770" end="00:26:27.580" style="s2">given acid but I will dead now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.810" end="00:26:29.800" style="s2">back to the at reject lake yeah you know</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.800" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">bunch of complicated chemicals and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.630" end="00:26:38.410" style="s2">including the yes I&#39;m not going together</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.700" end="00:26:40.900" style="s2">alright yeah so now you&#39;ve got me down</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.410" end="00:26:45.580" style="s2">the rabbit hole of your critiquing the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.900" end="00:26:48.280" style="s2">sacred cow of social media uh-huh oh no</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.580" end="00:26:50.050" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s no question in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.280" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">mind that that&#39;s terrible that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.050" end="00:26:58.510" style="s2">you know I I don&#39;t know I think probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:27:01.930" style="s2">Facebook is the worst Facebook could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.510" end="00:27:05.830" style="s2">single-handedly the worst thing down the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.930" end="00:27:10.690" style="s2">America I mean any cuz you could say any</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.830" end="00:27:13.270" style="s2">extreme thing about Facebook every</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.690" end="00:27:14.370" style="s2">terrible thing that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.270" end="00:27:17.170" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.370" end="00:27:19.750" style="s2">that&#39;s how central what facebook has</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.170" end="00:27:21.430" style="s2">captured is is that you could speculate</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.750" end="00:27:23.740" style="s2">that as having impacts on basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.430" end="00:27:25.780" style="s2">everything it&#39;s the mental health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.740" end="00:27:27.880" style="s2">its socialization its nutrition its</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.780" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">health its politics it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.880" end="00:27:31.960" style="s2">because it what they&#39;ve done is captured</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:33.820" style="s2">our communicative infrastructure I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.960" end="00:27:36.670" style="s2">this would have elect rolling in his</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.820" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">grave right it&#39;s sort of like the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.670" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">subhuman subconscious being broadcast 24</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">hours 7 or so we&#39;ve so we keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:03.780" style="s2">due to this to this that&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:05.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not exactly where I you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.780" end="00:28:07.890" style="s2">thinking I&#39;m planning on going I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.730" end="00:28:09.750" style="s2">realize that sort of you&#39;re making me</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.890" end="00:28:12.780" style="s2">you&#39;re making me understand what a deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.750" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">issue this is this is what I didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.780" end="00:28:16.860" style="s2">to go on podcast right because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:19.799" style="s2">at a certain point we get past</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.860" end="00:28:22.110" style="s2">entertainment and we get into issues</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.799" end="00:28:24.900" style="s2">that actually make our heart go a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.110" end="00:28:26.970" style="s2">bit faster and we realize that we may be</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.900" end="00:28:29.340" style="s2">the ones in difficult situations</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.970" end="00:28:32.940" style="s2">deciding whether to stay or to leave</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.340" end="00:28:36.870" style="s2">right that will be thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.940" end="00:28:39.510" style="s2">basic needs and self regulation of our</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.740" end="00:29:33.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a resistance to hearing this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.260" end="00:29:37.049" style="s2">there&#39;s also the fact the feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.450" end="00:29:39.030" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary right so it&#39;s like how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.049" end="00:29:40.860" style="s2">we begin to talk about it like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.030" end="00:29:43.230" style="s2">begin to talk about it like I said what</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.860" end="00:29:45.000" style="s2">are the languages we can use so we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.230" end="00:29:46.590" style="s2">all say face together and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.000" end="00:29:48.270" style="s2">languages that we can discover that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.590" end="00:29:51.870" style="s2">would allow us to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.270" end="00:29:54.990" style="s2">unspeakable right like and I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.870" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">this before like when when billions</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.990" end="00:30:02.970" style="s2">watch millions die how will we handle</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:05.070" style="s2">that what will be on the news and on</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.970" end="00:30:09.500" style="s2">Twitter and we would behave ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.070" end="00:30:13.400" style="s2">right or will we spiral deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.500" end="00:30:15.980" style="s2">the performs of reactionary closed</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.400" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">mindedness that have driven us into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.980" end="00:30:20.180" style="s2">mental health crisis in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:25.150" style="s2">right this phrase the unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.180" end="00:30:28.160" style="s2">intimacy of planetary catastrophe mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.150" end="00:30:30.920" style="s2">closed back upon ourselves that there</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.160" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">are no escape hatches that every escape</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.920" end="00:30:36.980" style="s2">hatch goes in deeper and that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:42.980" style="s2">there left with the culture and one</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.980" end="00:30:45.380" style="s2">another yeah so you you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.980" end="00:30:50.270" style="s2">you&#39;ll be observing the plague like how</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.380" end="00:30:52.190" style="s2">do we react when the plague comes in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.270" end="00:30:56.270" style="s2">sense yeah and also trying to find ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.190" end="00:31:01.630" style="s2">to stop it you know trying to find ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.270" end="00:31:04.730" style="s2">to galvanize enough kind of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.630" end="00:31:06.560" style="s2">responsiveness capacity at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.730" end="00:31:07.520" style="s2">the individual in the community in time</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.560" end="00:31:10.400" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.520" end="00:31:16.100" style="s2">and so yeah at that point we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.400" end="00:31:18.350" style="s2">back to your utopias I think right well</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.100" end="00:31:22.040" style="s2">in certain innovations in civic process</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.350" end="00:31:24.440" style="s2">like if we could find ways to return to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.040" end="00:31:27.140" style="s2">having conversations this is some of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.440" end="00:31:30.290" style="s2">work I do with force Landry around</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.140" end="00:31:32.840" style="s2">civilizational design and thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.290" end="00:31:34.850" style="s2">civics work and then with Jonathan Ross</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.840" end="00:31:37.300" style="s2">and work I do with the transformational</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.850" end="00:31:40.280" style="s2">educational alliance right looking at</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.300" end="00:31:42.980" style="s2">actual concrete experimental work going</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.280" end="00:31:44.750" style="s2">on in education both in terms of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.980" end="00:31:47.330" style="s2">patching together the existing system</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.750" end="00:31:49.940" style="s2">which is the best of the best of today</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.330" end="00:31:52.490" style="s2">and what I call the first of the next</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.940" end="00:31:55.040" style="s2">right which are actually truly unique</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.490" end="00:31:57.170" style="s2">formers of Education that are responding</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.040" end="00:31:58.700" style="s2">directly to the fact that we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.170" end="00:32:02.510" style="s2">situation that we&#39;re in and there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.700" end="00:32:04.460" style="s2">examples of those and so yes these can</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.510" end="00:32:06.410" style="s2">you give some examples of those so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.460" end="00:32:13.820" style="s2">know so we can be more a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.410" end="00:32:15.350" style="s2">concrete like of which of this first</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.820" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">kind of education that you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.350" end="00:32:18.690" style="s2">this knit new forms of education new new</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:20.850" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.690" end="00:32:24.600" style="s2">forms of you know learning that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.850" end="00:32:26.670" style="s2">speaking of totally yeah I mean which</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.600" end="00:32:29.630" style="s2">one would be useful in a chat yes oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.670" end="00:32:32.430" style="s2">there&#39;s interesting stuff happening with</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.630" end="00:32:34.980" style="s2">integrated the integration of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.430" end="00:32:37.230" style="s2">cryptocurrency and kind of digital</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.980" end="00:32:39.270" style="s2">currencies with decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.230" end="00:32:42.780" style="s2">educational networks and accreditation</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.270" end="00:32:46.680" style="s2">right so this is the example of the work</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.780" end="00:32:48.510" style="s2">of Madhav&#39;s Amir who was a principal in</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.680" end="00:32:51.000" style="s2">New York City I&#39;m thinking after reading</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.510" end="00:32:55.980" style="s2">my book we&#39;ve been constructing</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.000" end="00:32:58.140" style="s2">basically a way to do like github for</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.980" end="00:33:00.750" style="s2">teachers and students that ends up</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.140" end="00:33:02.850" style="s2">allowing them to co-create curricula and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:05.790" style="s2">standards and then he&#39;s just wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.850" end="00:33:08.070" style="s2">compete eventually with the existing</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.790" end="00:33:11.430" style="s2">standardized testing infrastructures and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.070" end="00:33:15.000" style="s2">tie success within his system to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.430" end="00:33:17.940" style="s2">digital wallet right so he&#39;s rolling out</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.000" end="00:33:20.670" style="s2">a basic income guarantee to the next</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.940" end="00:33:23.010" style="s2">generation on the back of an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.670" end="00:33:25.980" style="s2">way of assessing their merit in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.010" end="00:33:28.590" style="s2">their creativity and trying to Wed this</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.980" end="00:33:30.300" style="s2">to the New York City kind of schooling</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.590" end="00:33:32.910" style="s2">crisis so that the kids who are falling</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.300" end="00:33:35.370" style="s2">between the cracks gets shuffled in and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.910" end="00:33:37.740" style="s2">brought up through his digital negative</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.370" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">accreditation system as he calls it so</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.740" end="00:33:42.600" style="s2">that&#39;s an example of like the first of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:44.430" style="s2">the next where I&#39;d you don&#39;t know his</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.600" end="00:33:46.710" style="s2">work is it&#39;s incredible but will the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.430" end="00:33:48.420" style="s2">will it be exactly that I don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.710" end="00:33:50.790" style="s2">something like that and something like</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.420" end="00:33:53.910" style="s2">that something like that is gonna need</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.790" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">to emerge where we decentralized the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.910" end="00:34:00.630" style="s2">schools and relate the kind of like but</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:02.040" style="s2">at this point not accredited forms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.630" end="00:34:03.330" style="s2">creativity that kids are doing which are</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.040" end="00:34:05.280" style="s2">actually going to be socially valuable</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.330" end="00:34:07.950" style="s2">in the future find those to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.280" end="00:34:10.080" style="s2">remunerate &#39;add through a currency</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.950" end="00:34:13.890" style="s2">that&#39;s not necessarily the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.080" end="00:34:16.050" style="s2">about to crash and so basically using</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.890" end="00:34:20.940" style="s2">the educational system to reboot the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.050" end="00:34:23.220" style="s2">whole economic system is is where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.940" end="00:34:26.640" style="s2">seeing that first as you said in your</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.220" end="00:34:28.620" style="s2">book something about like a konami being</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.640" end="00:34:29.640" style="s2">subservient to education like correct</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.620" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.640" end="00:34:34.100" style="s2">education is primary and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:36.950" style="s2">then economics comes comes next after</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.100" end="00:34:38.090" style="s2">that that&#39;s true and and that&#39;s back to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.950" end="00:34:40.340" style="s2">the fact that you can&#39;t even have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.090" end="00:34:44.149" style="s2">economy unless you&#39;ve educated the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.340" end="00:34:45.710" style="s2">workers and but it&#39;s also the case that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.149" end="00:34:49.070" style="s2">you know to what end is all of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.710" end="00:34:50.750" style="s2">economic production is to for</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.070" end="00:34:51.740" style="s2">subsistence with them beyond that we get</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.750" end="00:34:53.000" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.740" end="00:34:56.090" style="s2">remember religion that was all</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.000" end="00:34:59.330" style="s2">educational all stacked on top of and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.090" end="00:35:01.480" style="s2">ostensibly the purpose for the economy</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.330" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">itself was to channel upwards into these</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.480" end="00:35:08.120" style="s2">temples of learning and so yet there was</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:11.090" style="s2">a camp put on and we channeled to back</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.120" end="00:35:14.890" style="s2">up for it&#39;s God himself and for abstract</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.090" end="00:35:14.890" style="s2">numbers and endless accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.340" end="00:35:20.600" style="s2">capital basically what we could have</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.690" end="00:35:23.630" style="s2">been channeling it up and into basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.600" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">an infinite educational game and so if</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.630" end="00:35:29.060" style="s2">you place an infinite educational game</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:32.570" style="s2">on the top of what we know as now the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.060" end="00:35:33.830" style="s2">kind of economy then you end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.570" end="00:35:36.380" style="s2">something that runs a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.830" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">differently yeah so the educational hub</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.380" end="00:35:41.540" style="s2">network which I proposed in the book is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">actually something like that it&#39;s as you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.540" end="00:35:45.860" style="s2">mentioned the first sentence getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:48.590" style="s2">going something like the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.860" end="00:35:50.330" style="s2">frontier of human potential that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.590" end="00:35:52.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have an infinite frontier of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.330" end="00:35:55.580" style="s2">resources on the planet and I guess we</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.790" end="00:35:57.230" style="s2">can start mining asteroids but there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.580" end="00:35:59.690" style="s2">a way in which we do have an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.230" end="00:36:03.530" style="s2">frontier of human potential that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.690" end="00:36:07.550" style="s2">already here and so switching kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.530" end="00:36:09.830" style="s2">like commodity frontiers from the actual</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.550" end="00:36:11.720" style="s2">material resources to these resources</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.830" end="00:36:13.430" style="s2">within the human is already underway I</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.720" end="00:36:15.380" style="s2">remember there capturing your attention</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.430" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">so it was about actually leveraging the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.380" end="00:36:21.410" style="s2">move into new aspheric extraction and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:24.140" style="s2">actually transforming and actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.410" end="00:36:26.410" style="s2">transforming that into a net benefit by</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.140" end="00:36:30.860" style="s2">turning it into an education centric</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.410" end="00:36:33.950" style="s2">society and that was kind of a mouthful</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.860" end="00:36:35.600" style="s2">but that&#39;s in a sense division and when</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.950" end="00:36:37.490" style="s2">you think about you know what could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.600" end="00:36:41.300" style="s2">the thing that a civilization could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.490" end="00:36:44.620" style="s2">about in order to exist in perpetuity it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.300" end="00:36:46.600" style="s2">would need to be about finding ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.620" end="00:36:48.340" style="s2">to educate humans within the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.600" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">civilization order then make that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.340" end="00:36:52.930" style="s2">civilization better right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:55.720" style="s2">conveniences vision that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.930" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">civilization needs to teach all things</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.720" end="00:37:00.130" style="s2">to all people that the civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:02.650" style="s2">fundamentally that&#39;s what civilizing</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.130" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">means it means to be educating in such a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.650" end="00:37:08.050" style="s2">way that it can reproduce itself and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:10.270" style="s2">grow itself in an all-men&#39;s of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.050" end="00:37:11.620" style="s2">educational function of the civilization</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.270" end="00:37:13.390" style="s2">is the autopoietic function of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.620" end="00:37:14.950" style="s2">social critic you write that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.390" end="00:37:16.840" style="s2">educational function is the self</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.950" end="00:37:19.840" style="s2">maintaining and the self transforming of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.840" end="00:37:22.420" style="s2">the civilization which means that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.840" end="00:37:24.700" style="s2">need to make it in the sense to focus</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.420" end="00:37:27.580" style="s2">you can&#39;t have the education be about</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.700" end="00:37:29.230" style="s2">the civilization building capital you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.580" end="00:37:31.090" style="s2">can&#39;t have the education be about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.230" end="00:37:32.890" style="s2">civilization creating Wars you have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.090" end="00:37:36.460" style="s2">have the education be about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.890" end="00:37:37.870" style="s2">civilization being educational and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.460" end="00:37:40.540" style="s2">you&#39;re into the infinite frontier of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.870" end="00:37:42.580" style="s2">human potential and the temple of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.540" end="00:37:44.920" style="s2">learning stacked on top of the economics</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.580" end="00:37:50.200" style="s2">boy that&#39;s important that&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.920" end="00:37:51.700" style="s2">that&#39;s just that&#39;s so important I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.200" end="00:37:54.690" style="s2">it&#39;s just like it&#39;s just a total</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.700" end="00:37:57.460" style="s2">reorientation of you know how people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.690" end="00:37:59.530" style="s2">think of themselves as human beings but</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.460" end="00:38:01.420" style="s2">basically that&#39;s what you&#39;re this you</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.530" end="00:38:02.590" style="s2">know just that&#39;s one of our difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.420" end="00:38:05.080" style="s2">is that we&#39;re gonna have to reimagine</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.590" end="00:38:08.020" style="s2">ourselves beyond the category of wage</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.080" end="00:38:10.450" style="s2">labor for example yeah going to school</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.020" end="00:38:13.570" style="s2">and getting a job and all that crap is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.450" end="00:38:14.370" style="s2">like right that&#39;s not really what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.570" end="00:38:22.080" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.370" end="00:38:24.610" style="s2">yeah Wow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.080" end="00:38:27.190" style="s2">that blows me away and actually III</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.610" end="00:38:33.160" style="s2">think that the fact that you propose an</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.190" end="00:38:35.710" style="s2">idea like that it almost may</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.160" end="00:38:37.809" style="s2">it almost makes it possible when such an</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.710" end="00:38:40.690" style="s2">idea is being proposed does that make</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.809" end="00:38:42.130" style="s2">sense it could be I mean you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.690" end="00:38:43.809" style="s2">imagine it I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.130" end="00:38:46.030" style="s2">to say here I&#39;m trying to say that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.809" end="00:38:48.789" style="s2">it has to be imagined first has to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.030" end="00:38:50.799" style="s2">imagined first of course you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.789" end="00:38:53.559" style="s2">there&#39;s also the concrete utopian</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.799" end="00:38:55.299" style="s2">theorist is also always accused it and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.559" end="00:38:56.859" style="s2">have at a right right well I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.299" end="00:38:59.140" style="s2">get me excited when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.859" end="00:39:02.789" style="s2">this good and then I stop myself when I</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.140" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">think hmm am I being naive here right</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.789" end="00:39:07.750" style="s2">exactly the naivete and then also the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:08.950" style="s2">sense that of too much of a generalist</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.750" end="00:39:11.109" style="s2">that you&#39;re moving across too many</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:13.960" style="s2">fields and that you&#39;re seeing the force</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.109" end="00:39:16.150" style="s2">but not the trees and and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.960" end="00:39:21.220" style="s2">this is true but at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.150" end="00:39:23.710" style="s2">think that you know there&#39;s no escape</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.220" end="00:39:26.980" style="s2">from having some kind of articulate</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.710" end="00:39:30.339" style="s2">vision yeah like we need to have some</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.980" end="00:39:31.960" style="s2">language about the future you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.339" end="00:39:35.049" style="s2">the other thing I mean that&#39;s the social</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.960" end="00:39:38.799" style="s2">vision there&#39;s also a Cosmo vision there</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.049" end="00:39:40.900" style="s2">has Moe imagined all vision that is part</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.799" end="00:39:42.369" style="s2">of that new educational system because</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.900" end="00:39:43.779" style="s2">remember as we discussed if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.369" end="00:39:46.119" style="s2">have real living religion within the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.779" end="00:39:47.140" style="s2">educational system it&#39;s weird so so</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.119" end="00:39:49.450" style="s2">there&#39;s another piece to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.140" end="00:39:52.119" style="s2">reconstruction to get to the other world</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.450" end="00:39:54.849" style="s2">on the other the that reconstructing</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.119" end="00:39:57.760" style="s2">that involves rebuilding kind of Cosmo</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.849" end="00:39:59.950" style="s2">vision I&#39;d not so this is the work I do</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:03.480" style="s2">with Gaffney in a Cosimo neurotic</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.950" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">humanism right dandy needs to be a new</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.480" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">fundamental kind of way to craft</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">narratives not a new single narrative</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:13.930" style="s2">but a new language that&#39;s available so</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:17.609" style="s2">people can begin to construct narratives</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.930" end="00:40:22.270" style="s2">together and opening the possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.609" end="00:40:23.799" style="s2">new kind of Cosmo imaginal visions I</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.270" end="00:40:27.309" style="s2">like that word but it really just means</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.799" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">that your story of everything like what</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.309" end="00:40:33.839" style="s2">is your ultimate environment yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:36.700" style="s2">I was listening to an Orthodox Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.839" end="00:40:39.460" style="s2">person talk about the Messiah and he was</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.700" end="00:40:41.380" style="s2">just saying you know I got really caught</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.460" end="00:40:43.450" style="s2">up in what he was saying and it sounded</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.380" end="00:40:45.020" style="s2">so true it&#39;s like okay if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.450" end="00:40:47.390" style="s2">you&#39;re an orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.020" end="00:40:50.270" style="s2">Jew you would you would say the Messiah</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.390" end="00:40:52.040" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not that you you want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.270" end="00:40:53.660" style="s2">have faith in the Messiah he will come</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.040" end="00:40:57.260" style="s2">it&#39;s just like it&#39;s absolutely has to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.660" end="00:40:58.520" style="s2">come and it is it&#39;s almost like and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.260" end="00:41:02.420" style="s2">was like getting into this and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.520" end="00:41:06.050" style="s2">an orthodox you at all but but but I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.420" end="00:41:07.730" style="s2">thinking about about you know even you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.050" end="00:41:09.620" style="s2">could we get the darker we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.730" end="00:41:13.340" style="s2">all these things like the plague and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.620" end="00:41:15.650" style="s2">the extreme darkness at the same time as</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.340" end="00:41:18.500" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about this something else</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.650" end="00:41:20.840" style="s2">emerges you know it&#39;s like the two</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.500" end="00:41:23.570" style="s2">things arise simultaneously you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.840" end="00:41:25.160" style="s2">call it Messiah if you wanted or the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.570" end="00:41:27.320" style="s2">principle that&#39;s going to that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.160" end="00:41:28.460" style="s2">to save civilization all right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.320" end="00:41:31.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a saying in the Kabbalah</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.460" end="00:41:34.340" style="s2">something like greater is the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.310" end="00:41:36.890" style="s2">that comes from the light yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.340" end="00:41:39.620" style="s2">was actually like one of these Talmudic</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.890" end="00:41:41.270" style="s2">like you know double marginalia on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.620" end="00:41:42.860" style="s2">phrase from the Bible which is something</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.270" end="00:41:45.110" style="s2">like greater is the darkness than the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.860" end="00:41:46.520" style="s2">light but sound like well great is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.110" end="00:41:47.780" style="s2">darkness and the light that&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.520" end="00:41:50.150" style="s2">that&#39;s not why would you even write that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.780" end="00:41:52.190" style="s2">graters the darkness doesn&#39;t seem so</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.150" end="00:41:54.140" style="s2">then you reinterpreted graters is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.190" end="00:41:56.210" style="s2">darkness that comes from light which</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.140" end="00:41:57.650" style="s2">deepens it and it ends up being what</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.210" end="00:42:02.330" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about which is then yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.650" end="00:42:05.060" style="s2">precisely in the darkness that and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.330" end="00:42:07.370" style="s2">the broke and the broken shards that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.060" end="00:42:09.890" style="s2">lights gonna begin to shine through and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.370" end="00:42:11.780" style="s2">so that&#39;s why it&#39;s gonna be important as</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.890" end="00:42:15.260" style="s2">the things begin to break in that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.780" end="00:42:19.210" style="s2">that love becomes primary known again</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.260" end="00:42:23.090" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t become you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.210" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">ensnared and and and and in endless</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.090" end="00:42:28.640" style="s2">dystopian visions of you know and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:31.340" style="s2">unrealistic you know one that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:34.670" style="s2">turn away from each other and that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.340" end="00:42:36.230" style="s2">know what to do with the stranger you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.670" end="00:42:38.660" style="s2">know back to the Jewish tradition like</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.230" end="00:42:41.690" style="s2">the Old Testament is about the stranger</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.660" end="00:42:43.340" style="s2">what do you do with the stranger so</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.690" end="00:42:45.320" style="s2">Gaffney scholarship shows that the word</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.340" end="00:42:48.080" style="s2">stranger occurs in the text almost more</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.320" end="00:42:49.860" style="s2">than any other and so you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.080" end="00:42:52.110" style="s2">this complication around</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.860" end="00:42:54.090" style="s2">what do we do we meet the stranger on</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.110" end="00:42:57.030" style="s2">the road right in between civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.090" end="00:42:58.890" style="s2">in between law right in between rock and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.030" end="00:43:01.890" style="s2">story what do we do with the stranger on</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.890" end="00:43:07.050" style="s2">the road yeah you know how do we not</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.890" end="00:43:10.320" style="s2">turn away and you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.050" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s some of some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.320" end="00:43:15.660" style="s2">facets of the vision I have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">getting that language rebuilt that would</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.660" end="00:43:20.910" style="s2">allow us to have good reason and social</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:24.930" style="s2">sanction to deal with the strange on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.910" end="00:43:27.810" style="s2">road yeah no civilized way yeah I love</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.930" end="00:43:30.690" style="s2">the stranger how to love the stranger</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.810" end="00:43:34.740" style="s2">exactly I love the stranger yeah how do</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.690" end="00:43:38.520" style="s2">you love the stranger and according to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.740" end="00:43:42.120" style="s2">most of our kind of social science you</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.520" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">don&#39;t you can&#39;t you built your built not</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.120" end="00:43:46.950" style="s2">to whereas now there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:52.820" style="s2">different niche as possible but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.950" end="00:43:52.820" style="s2">requires these more robust languages and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.210" end="00:44:00.270" style="s2">requires probably it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.670" end="00:44:02.070" style="s2">like religion is coming back it is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.270" end="00:44:04.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s the opposite of what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.070" end="00:44:05.910" style="s2">would think if you are like a Marxist or</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.110" end="00:44:08.040" style="s2">something it&#39;s like we&#39;re get it or</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.910" end="00:44:11.850" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna become more and more just</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.040" end="00:44:14.580" style="s2">free of religion and more rational and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.850" end="00:44:16.590" style="s2">more yeah but it seems like it seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.580" end="00:44:20.370" style="s2">like religion is just gonna come back</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.590" end="00:44:22.230" style="s2">like like it for better and purer better</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.370" end="00:44:24.870" style="s2">exactly for better and for worse there</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.230" end="00:44:28.890" style="s2">could be and more crazy cults but also a</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.870" end="00:44:31.020" style="s2">more nor like you know and explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.890" end="00:44:32.550" style="s2">and implicitly so there&#39;ll be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.020" end="00:44:33.590" style="s2">things which are held with religious</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.550" end="00:44:36.180" style="s2">fervor</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.590" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">which are not technically religious but</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.180" end="00:44:40.530" style="s2">that&#39;s a religious thing happening right</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">there and as this situation heats up</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.530" end="00:44:44.580" style="s2">yeah the religiosity is going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:47.340" style="s2">intensify and so there will be new</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.580" end="00:44:51.020" style="s2">religions definitely and there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.340" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">return to religion and to the religious</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.020" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">pathos and ethos yeah even in things</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:58.650" style="s2">that are not technically religious so</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:44:59.250" style="s2">that that&#39;s is the some of the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.650" end="00:45:02.340" style="s2">we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.250" end="00:45:04.620" style="s2">turn to extremism has to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.340" end="00:45:09.210" style="s2">I think tendency of the human psyche to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.620" end="00:45:19.230" style="s2">find a way to to give something ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.210" end="00:45:21.090" style="s2">meaning mmm very interesting yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.230" end="00:45:22.470" style="s2">actually this kind of fanaticism you</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.090" end="00:45:27.180" style="s2">know if you if you look at it as the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.470" end="00:45:30.120" style="s2">shadow of something that that you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.180" end="00:45:38.690" style="s2">as you say that the ultimate that could</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.120" end="00:45:44.730" style="s2">be the of the ultimate meaning or yes I</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.690" end="00:45:46.440" style="s2">strange times the strangeness of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.730" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">hitting me in this conversation is just</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.440" end="00:45:52.050" style="s2">it&#39;s just the strangeness of the times</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:56.490" style="s2">that we&#39;re living in and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.050" end="00:45:58.230" style="s2">religion do we need I think we spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.490" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">it right yeah I think we need one that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.230" end="00:46:10.970" style="s2">allows us to to love the stranger and</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:14.220" style="s2">you know and to to I think provide non</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.970" end="00:46:16.170" style="s2">reciprocated care all right so we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.220" end="00:46:19.020" style="s2">to find a religion that can get us out</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.170" end="00:46:22.280" style="s2">of transactional zero-sum gaming and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.020" end="00:46:25.590" style="s2">into giving without thought or receiving</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.280" end="00:46:29.370" style="s2">that there needs to be profound</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.590" end="00:46:30.510" style="s2">generosity and compassion instilled in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.370" end="00:46:34.140" style="s2">the human heart and that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.510" end="00:46:37.500" style="s2">allows us to love the stranger the basic</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.140" end="00:46:41.340" style="s2">thing you know yeah and so so yeah in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.500" end="00:46:44.460" style="s2">sense I would like to see you know and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.340" end="00:46:46.350" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because I in my experience a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.460" end="00:46:49.190" style="s2">lot of the religion that we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.350" end="00:46:54.620" style="s2">saying has to do with state experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.190" end="00:46:57.840" style="s2">and kind of like in a sense the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.620" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">cultivation of personal meaning and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.840" end="00:47:04.820" style="s2">end the kind of like deepening of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:07.740" style="s2">intensity of impersonal meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.820" end="00:47:09.630" style="s2">which is important and so we&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.740" end="00:47:11.560" style="s2">and meditating and trying to attain</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.630" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">Satori or something high</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.560" end="00:47:16.810" style="s2">that&#39;s actually we&#39;re doing we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:19.450" style="s2">drugs right or doing psychedelics having</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.810" end="00:47:21.100" style="s2">all these incredible sort of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.450" end="00:47:23.800" style="s2">well there&#39;s something that&#39;s and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.100" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">maybe the ethical part of that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.800" end="00:47:29.020" style="s2">ethical part of that and and again</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:32.920" style="s2">having idle part of that do those things</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.020" end="00:47:36.910" style="s2">help you love the stranger and will</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.920" end="00:47:39.510" style="s2">those things allow you to give non</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.910" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">reciprocated care and concern to people</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.510" end="00:47:43.990" style="s2">and so that&#39;s just the question that</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:47.230" style="s2">needs to be asked and so I think yet</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.990" end="00:47:50.170" style="s2">there&#39;s an element of explicit emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.230" end="00:47:51.690" style="s2">on service and charity that one finds in</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.170" end="00:47:53.620" style="s2">some of the judeo-christian traditions</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.690" end="00:47:57.010" style="s2">which could give a shit if you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.620" end="00:47:58.420" style="s2">meditate and what your state experiences</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.010" end="00:48:01.000" style="s2">are and how many plant journeys you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.420" end="00:48:02.670" style="s2">been on yeah that&#39;s why the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.000" end="00:48:06.520" style="s2">East and the West have to kind of meet</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.670" end="00:48:09.400" style="s2">they do they do we knew we needed all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.520" end="00:48:11.260" style="s2">the yoga&#39;s from the east right we need</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.400" end="00:48:12.940" style="s2">we do because otherwise it&#39;s too hard to</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.260" end="00:48:14.110" style="s2">give otherwise it&#39;s too hard to give and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.940" end="00:48:15.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.110" end="00:48:17.710" style="s2">integrate we need to have wisdom right</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.970" end="00:48:20.320" style="s2">we need to but we also need to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.710" end="00:48:23.800" style="s2">history and the categories of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.320" end="00:48:27.940" style="s2">stranger which don&#39;t exists once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.800" end="00:48:29.890" style="s2">up and out and Satori and and and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.940" end="00:48:32.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s interesting too is that as</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.890" end="00:48:34.120" style="s2">history heats up the history those</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.200" end="00:48:36.700" style="s2">religions a deal with historicity become</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.120" end="00:48:38.410" style="s2">important but those religions that say</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.700" end="00:48:41.260" style="s2">that there is no history become</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.410" end="00:48:42.610" style="s2">attractive and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.260" end="00:48:44.950" style="s2">situations were anywhere that you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.610" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">see in a sense some of the religions as</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.950" end="00:48:48.040" style="s2">a way out because that is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:49.450" style="s2">the New Age is that what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.040" end="00:48:52.540" style="s2">about when you say that the religion</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.450" end="00:48:54.390" style="s2">that is in all this talk about being in</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.540" end="00:48:57.700" style="s2">the now and that sort of thing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.390" end="00:48:59.860" style="s2">some of the New Age stuff you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.700" end="00:49:02.980" style="s2">kind of like just it&#39;s experiencing at</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.860" end="00:49:07.480" style="s2">the moment and you know and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.980" end="00:49:09.610" style="s2">mindful when you eat your food and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.480" end="00:49:11.320" style="s2">what it&#39;s like give me something a</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.610" end="00:49:14.830" style="s2">little bit deeper than that please all</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.320" end="00:49:20.580" style="s2">right right and something with content</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.830" end="00:49:25.260" style="s2">of moral and ethical instruction</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.580" end="00:49:28.530" style="s2">and of sustenance for the soul and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.260" end="00:49:30.510" style="s2">tragedy there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.530" end="00:49:31.080" style="s2">getting that unbearable image out of</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.510" end="00:49:32.730" style="s2">your mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.080" end="00:49:34.320" style="s2">and getting the unbearable image out of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.730" end="00:49:35.160" style="s2">your mind and getting them bare and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.320" end="00:49:37.910" style="s2">that&#39;s out of your mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.160" end="00:49:41.220" style="s2">then holding the unbearable image and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.910" end="00:49:44.940" style="s2">finding ways to discuss with others and</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.220" end="00:49:46.770" style="s2">so again I like that at all that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.940" end="00:49:51.120" style="s2">that seems to me that that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.770" end="00:49:53.100" style="s2">like so holding the unbearable image</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.120" end="00:49:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s the phantom and again that&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.100" end="00:49:57.600" style="s2">the alchemical tradition and has to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.470" end="00:50:00.300" style="s2">with a process of purification kind of</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.930" end="00:50:17.340" style="s2">into situation ala day and that is so</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.080" end="00:50:20.310" style="s2">the religions that allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.340" end="00:50:25.040" style="s2">characterize those intimate spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.310" end="00:50:28.050" style="s2">to place the heroic within the personal</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.040" end="00:50:29.730" style="s2">as opposed to the heroic and the</p>

<p begin="00:50:37.500" end="00:50:42.870" style="s2">work that&#39;s done right here between</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.730" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">people in actual conversation and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.870" end="00:50:49.830" style="s2">again as things unfold and heat up</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:52.290" style="s2">there&#39;s this question of can we stay</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.830" end="00:50:53.310" style="s2">with one another and not turn away from</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.290" end="00:50:55.940" style="s2">each other now generally from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.310" end="00:50:59.900" style="s2">stranger and then feel the reality of</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.900" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">and that it is not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.060" end="00:51:10.590" style="s2">simulation and this happens of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:12.180" style="s2">when there&#39;s natural disasters and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.590" end="00:51:15.120" style="s2">always kind of commented upon like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.180" end="00:51:18.020" style="s2">way like after 9/11 for example the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.120" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">number of people who were spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.020" end="00:51:21.990" style="s2">talking to one another trying to take</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:23.480" style="s2">care of one another looking after one</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.990" end="00:51:25.610" style="s2">another in the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.480" end="00:51:27.910" style="s2">who on any other given day would have</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.610" end="00:51:30.530" style="s2">just walked by one another not even</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.910" end="00:51:32.780" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a tricky to do that in an</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.530" end="00:51:35.000" style="s2">ordinary day when you&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.780" end="00:51:37.190" style="s2">through your ordinary day right it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.000" end="00:51:40.100" style="s2">but it&#39;s also that we&#39;re not subject to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.190" end="00:51:42.890" style="s2">tragedy right now as we&#39;re speaking you</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.100" end="00:51:47.630" style="s2">know right and we are sort of leaning</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.890" end="00:51:49.550" style="s2">into into that a little bit like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.630" end="00:51:51.500" style="s2">where whereas if there was some tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.550" end="00:51:53.900" style="s2">yes well you know our hearts would would</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.500" end="00:51:55.910" style="s2">explode open and you know we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.900" end="00:51:58.520" style="s2">breathe you know we would want to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.910" end="00:52:00.560" style="s2">something in and but but in its it may</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.520" end="00:52:02.030" style="s2">be in the most banal States that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.560" end="00:52:04.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s but that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.030" end="00:52:06.920" style="s2">that where does the doctor you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.400" end="00:52:08.600" style="s2">there&#39;s no like day to day or every day</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.920" end="00:52:10.160" style="s2">right now in those parts of Australia</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.600" end="00:52:11.870" style="s2">like there&#39;s not like a daily routine</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.160" end="00:52:13.430" style="s2">that people are stuck in like I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.870" end="00:52:16.340" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to find it and get in it</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.430" end="00:52:18.980" style="s2">yeah though again we&#39;re back to out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.340" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">the simulation into the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.980" end="00:52:23.450" style="s2">fact that a lot of people in the West</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:24.980" style="s2">are gonna have their day-to-day routines</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.450" end="00:52:29.240" style="s2">completely disrupted in the coming</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.980" end="00:52:33.650" style="s2">decade and and and so that&#39;s this issue</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.240" end="00:52:35.390" style="s2">of what how will we respond and do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.650" end="00:52:39.290" style="s2">have the cultural resources to respond</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.390" end="00:52:43.490" style="s2">in the civilized way and back to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.290" end="00:52:45.650" style="s2">educational and a hydrogenic crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.490" end="00:52:50.600" style="s2">yeah but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.650" end="00:52:55.360" style="s2">intensity to to the focus that&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.600" end="00:52:58.040" style="s2">on the part of I think educators and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.360" end="00:53:01.100" style="s2">artists and people of that ilk because</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.040" end="00:53:04.990" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be on them who it falls to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.100" end="00:53:07.790" style="s2">create the contexts and languages</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.990" end="00:53:13.070" style="s2">symbols by which we start to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.790" end="00:53:15.730" style="s2">of this and I&#39;m trying to draw more and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.070" end="00:53:20.420" style="s2">more people up to that level of creative</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.730" end="00:53:21.800" style="s2">endeavor and need because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.420" end="00:53:25.100" style="s2">existing out and the culture is just not</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.800" end="00:53:26.270" style="s2">enough for people to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.100" end="00:53:28.490" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s happening in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.270" end="00:53:29.690" style="s2">no there&#39;s nothing there right so they</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.490" end="00:53:31.730" style="s2">look for more and more and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.690" end="00:53:33.890" style="s2">and more so they get many many many</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.730" end="00:53:35.540" style="s2">hours of content but never actually the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.890" end="00:53:36.829" style="s2">thing that&#39;s gonna get them something</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.540" end="00:53:40.809" style="s2">that would allow them to step away</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.829" end="00:53:45.670" style="s2">from a Content and solve a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.809" end="00:53:49.969" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s a shitload of work to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.670" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">and so many unique individual gifts to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.969" end="00:54:03.049" style="s2">be given all that to be galvanized yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:05.299" style="s2">yeah I again had this sort of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.049" end="00:54:07.819" style="s2">of the apocalypse right I keep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.299" end="00:54:09.469" style="s2">of all these biblical things to them but</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.819" end="00:54:11.420" style="s2">the apocalypse red isn&#39;t it mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.469" end="00:54:14.690" style="s2">something like the revealing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.420" end="00:54:16.849" style="s2">what&#39;s there what&#39;s what&#39;s it does what</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.690" end="00:54:18.619" style="s2">do you do when when this happens when</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.849" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">the apocalypse come is like that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.619" end="00:54:24.799" style="s2">you know if we&#39;re if we&#39;re in this sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:26.660" style="s2">of place like what do you do it at that</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.799" end="00:54:30.670" style="s2">point and that&#39;s that&#39;s the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.660" end="00:54:33.829" style="s2">issue right right totally totally I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.670" end="00:54:35.180" style="s2">that&#39;s why often I&#39;m like I&#39;m not super</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.829" end="00:54:37.999" style="s2">interested in saving the world but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.180" end="00:54:42.289" style="s2">super interested in saving souls right</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.999" end="00:54:44.269" style="s2">but when you are thinking opposed be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.289" end="00:54:45.890" style="s2">soul is more important than the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.269" end="00:54:47.390" style="s2">though yeah that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying so</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.890" end="00:54:50.109" style="s2">think about hospice care like we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.390" end="00:54:52.489" style="s2">situation of civilizational hospice care</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.109" end="00:54:55.069" style="s2">again even if something new emerges this</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.489" end="00:54:56.959" style="s2">one&#39;s still dying so we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.069" end="00:54:59.989" style="s2">situation of needing to allow something</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.959" end="00:55:03.049" style="s2">to die and actually hopefully finding a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.989" end="00:55:06.319" style="s2">way to save the soul of the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.049" end="00:55:08.809" style="s2">dying and not like I&#39;m not trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.319" end="00:55:11.989" style="s2">into ontology or anything yeah trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.809" end="00:55:14.660" style="s2">get into the way that you can relate to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.989" end="00:55:17.269" style="s2">something that needs to pass but still</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.660" end="00:55:21.940" style="s2">needs to be cared for and that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.269" end="00:55:24.499" style="s2">actually be brought to a kind of view</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:27.349" style="s2">beautification it&#39;s brought to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.499" end="00:55:29.539" style="s2">self clarity right so if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.349" end="00:55:31.880" style="s2">Erikson Erik Erikson&#39;s developmental</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.539" end="00:55:34.339" style="s2">model his final stage of adult</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.880" end="00:55:37.279" style="s2">maturation involved this crisis between</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.339" end="00:55:39.400" style="s2">integrity and despair and it had to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.279" end="00:55:42.440" style="s2">with how can you make sense of your life</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.400" end="00:55:44.059" style="s2">in the face of death right and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.440" end="00:55:47.420" style="s2">either despair that you can&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.059" end="00:55:50.210" style="s2">of that it was all just senseless or you</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.420" end="00:55:52.130" style="s2">find a way to integrity&#39; Slee I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.210" end="00:55:54.710" style="s2">integrity hold the meaning of your life</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.130" end="00:55:58.550" style="s2">and so this is what you do when you face</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.710" end="00:56:01.400" style="s2">the apocalypse that happens in every</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.550" end="00:56:03.380" style="s2">moment also it&#39;s like it can or you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.400" end="00:56:04.940" style="s2">feel a sense of despair in every moment</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.380" end="00:56:07.670" style="s2">and you can also find this</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.940" end="00:56:10.339" style="s2">openings but at the same time it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.670" end="00:56:11.990" style="s2">possible to get to ericksonian integrity</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.339" end="00:56:15.349" style="s2">without actually confronting death if</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.990" end="00:56:17.660" style="s2">you&#39;re able to be aware and against burn</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.349" end="00:56:20.300" style="s2">in the tragedy of all of life which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.660" end="00:56:23.660" style="s2">saturated with death and see the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.300" end="00:56:25.160" style="s2">transience so this is where you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.660" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">again you can&#39;t throw the meditative</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.160" end="00:56:28.790" style="s2">traditions out because they bring</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">certain things in which is the ability</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.790" end="00:56:36.830" style="s2">to look carefully an experience and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:39.050" style="s2">so I my sense is that the state of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.830" end="00:56:41.990" style="s2">Apocalypse is one where precisely that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.050" end="00:56:45.290" style="s2">you and face the integrity versus</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.990" end="00:56:49.760" style="s2">despair and integrity doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.290" end="00:56:51.890" style="s2">fixing it integrity it means living it</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.760" end="00:56:54.410" style="s2">grappling with it making meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.890" end="00:56:55.849" style="s2">basically again the beautification and</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.410" end="00:56:57.619" style="s2">the self clarification that can only</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.849" end="00:57:00.380" style="s2">happen as some things come to an end</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.619" end="00:57:02.450" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting that you you you</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.380" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">bring the word beautification together</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.450" end="00:57:09.380" style="s2">with with death yeah totally there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:58:26.920" end="00:58:30.520" style="s2">displacement again back to the purser</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.750" end="00:58:31.840" style="s2">news ever watch it really religiosity</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:45.430" style="s2">it was a religious idea and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.570" end="00:58:47.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve invested it with infinite Worth</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.430" end="00:58:51.490" style="s2">even though it&#39;s not infinite</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.290" end="00:58:54.700" style="s2">and so that&#39;s idolatry which is a form</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.490" end="00:58:56.620" style="s2">of sin which was plaguing the simulation</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.700" end="00:58:59.590" style="s2">right now because we&#39;re loading a bunch</p>

<p begin="00:58:59.590" end="00:59:05.260" style="s2">things with profound and almost infinite</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.160" end="00:59:09.160" style="s2">worth not realizing that actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.260" end="00:59:10.810" style="s2">not going to be there very soon and or</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.160" end="00:59:12.490" style="s2">by the way it&#39;s a scientific finding in</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.810" end="00:59:13.930" style="s2">scientific findings change that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.490" end="00:59:15.880" style="s2">scientific findings do that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.930" end="00:59:17.350" style="s2">science works so if you invested all in</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.880" end="00:59:20.650" style="s2">that that means we can&#39;t have science</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.350" end="00:59:23.980" style="s2">grow and learn because this way viewing</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.650" end="00:59:26.410" style="s2">the reality of science has become idle</p>

<p begin="00:59:26.410" end="00:59:31.290" style="s2">science is infused with religiosity so</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.480" end="00:59:33.730" style="s2">it&#39;s correct in our to the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.290" end="00:59:36.250" style="s2">to the blue churches who would string me</p>
