<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">brain supplementation and i tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">stuff is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">out of this world i mean it it truly</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">what you expect it to do and it really</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">is just taking the brain to a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">of optimization we found this</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">after i had referred several patients to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">it to try it out because it really had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">mix</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">of nutrients that i said you know this</p>

<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">and so it led down the road to several</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">with the company and eventually um i had</p>

<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">and the guy is absolutely fascinating so</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">i asked him to come on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">and to talk about the whole neurohacker</p>

<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">and he agreed to do so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">interview that is really out of this</p>

<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">schmoktenberger is</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">so what i did is i asked him to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">tell us about himself</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">and about the company and their mission</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">agreed to come on and talk to us</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">about various topics but most</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">importantly we want to focus</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">on the company that is part of his</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">and some of the products that they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">but let&#39;s start off uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">daniel talking about who you are just</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">give us some background and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">about what makes you you</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">hmm very open question</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">so i think a meaningful place to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">is i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">fortunate to be home educated as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">in a way that was kind of a an</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">educational experiment that my parents</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.080" style="s2">wanted to run</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">which was uh what happens if you give a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">kid no</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">curriculum at all expose them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">everything you can see what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">interested in and facilitate the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">interests</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">so i didn&#39;t have a fixed amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">social studies and english and etc</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">and what was really interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">that of course it means that there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">certain things that are part of normal</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">general education that i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">interested in and just didn&#39;t get so</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">my my handwriting is illegible my</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">spelling is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">bad but uh but i go very deeply into all</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">the sciences early on</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t even think of them as</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">separate divisions because</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">the division between biology and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">chemistry and physics are</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">useful for us for trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">but obviously universe is radically</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">integrated and you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">causal arrows pointing in uh up and down</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">directions</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">and so studying it that way it was just</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">the study of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">universe works and so all the areas of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:46.639" style="s2">all of the philosophic disciplines that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:48.479" style="s2">created context for maybe why is science</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.639" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">that way why is the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.479" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">the way that it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">and then all the different areas of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">activism how can we</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">understand the nature of reality better</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">so we can participate in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">alleviating suffering making a higher</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">quality of life experience possible for</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">so that braid of activism science and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">is kind of core to who i am and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.479" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">all of the various endeavors fit within</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">it yeah and that&#39;s why i wanted to bring</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">that up because</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">looking at your background i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">have a very diverse</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">kind of entrepreneurial background and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">activism background can you tell us</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">about some of the projects that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">they came from that yeah so working in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">activism early on</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">this was everything from ecological work</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:33.199" style="s2">to uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">civil rights work to animal rights work</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.199" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">one of the things that i saw also having</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">a background in interdisciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">ended up leading fortunately to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">background in system science</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">seemingly different things actually fit</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">together into self-organizing holes into</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">and so taking a system science approach</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">activism i saw okay here&#39;s an area where</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">say protect an animal from poaching and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">say it was an elephant we&#39;re gonna put</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">bigger fences around the preserves and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">create harsher sentencing for poachers</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">but we&#39;re not addressing the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">poverty of the people that can&#39;t meet</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">their needs</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">any other way adequately other than</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:15.919" style="s2">poaching we&#39;re not addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">value system and why it&#39;s conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.919" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">that way towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">animals not addressing macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">that leads to poverty we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">addressed like there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">that aren&#39;t being addressed</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">that if we succeed at getting the fences</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">up then the poachers move to some other</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">animal somewhere else or</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">you know some other problem and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">starting to look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">what would it take to actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">meaningfully address all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">that need addressed from a system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">point of view what would a whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">system&#39;s design upgrade for humanity</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">look like so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">relatively early on that became my</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">primary inquiry and so this was</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">maybe we actually can&#39;t change the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">future of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:53.120" style="s2">education to be optimal education that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">brings forth the uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.120" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">the full potential and capability of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">humans if we don&#39;t change macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">to where we&#39;re not having to prepare</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">those kids for a workforce in the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:02.400" style="s2">that we are now but we&#39;re preparing them</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.400" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">a different macroeconomic structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">where the facilitation of their unique</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">genius capabilities is you know is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">supported in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">the system they&#39;re coming into et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">right so start looking at what is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">future of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">macroeconomics what&#39;s the future of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">governance what&#39;s the future of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">education of healthcare that are optimum</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">factoring the interconnectivity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">all of those things upgrading so this</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">was the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">starting a think tank that then worked</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">with a number of other</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">leading edge think tanks on the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">fundamental restructure of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">in ways that could prevent current</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">that really must be prevented</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">catastrophic and existential risks that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">otherwise have too high of a probability</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">that could address the underlying causes</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">of so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">unnecessary human induced suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">that could produce highest quality of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">for the highest potential quality of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">life for all life</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">and so then it&#39;s just really been a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">refinement</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">of this process of what really needs to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">and how do we go about doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">for a while i worked with</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">large ngos and companies and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">implement some of the ideas through</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">through those vehicles until realizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">that those vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">really couldn&#39;t do the things that were</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">the groups that were working on hunger</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">were quite happy</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">to address starvation in areas of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">extreme poverty</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">by bringing industrial agriculture to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">the area to be able to create more food</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">production there</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">even if that meant more nitrogen runoff</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">leading to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.519" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">faster dead zones in the ocean because</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">those weren&#39;t the metrics they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">tasked with</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t mean they were really</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">happy it just means that the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">here&#39;s the metrics you&#39;re tasked with</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">and they are they are inter</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">connected with other things but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">not they&#39;re the focus of how that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">interconnectivity is addressed</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:56.640" style="s2">is just outside of the macro systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">that uh you know those structures are</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">part of and so eventually</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">said all right well let&#39;s just actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">look at how to build things from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">that can obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">the things that need obsoleted well</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">that&#39;s uh you know there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">behind why i wanted you to go into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">story i i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked previously and and i know</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">the story and i&#39;ve read some background</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s also one of the approaches we</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">use in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">our new paradigm of medicine of human</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">potential medicine where we look at this</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">entire biospherical approach so we look</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">at the interactions of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">all aspects of the human being including</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">environmental interactions and sleep</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">stress</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">thoughts brain function all of that so</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken this into just this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">think take process and here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">what i&#39;m leading to</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">is the the creation of neurohacker</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">that neurohacker collective actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">came from this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">think tank and i think that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">fascinating the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">the the organization i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">people will look at neurohacker</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">and they&#39;ll see the quality of product</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">and they&#39;ll think oh they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">supplement company but</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s far from even close to what</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">neurohacker collective is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">two things one is you said the approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">that we&#39;re describing for</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">civilization design and the approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">that you advocate for medicine</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">are very related they are very related</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">because the human</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">body and the human mind body environment</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">is a complex system and so if you try</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">and do</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">you know reductionist parts based</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">it just it works for acute things it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for complex things</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">and so all right there is too much ldl</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:41.839" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to give a statin but we</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">didn&#39;t really ask why there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.839" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">ldl</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">and what the externalities side effects</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">of the statin are going to be and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">know that approach just doesn&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">complex illness and it doesn&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">comprehensive wellness optimization so</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.279" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">across all of the different body systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">are there ways that the gut affects</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">the brain yes through the entire nervous</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">system through</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:06.440" style="s2">uh the microbiota through you know so</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">the division between neurology and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.440" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">gastroenterology</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">we just can&#39;t you can&#39;t maintain</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:14.240" style="s2">specialism across those boundaries you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">can&#39;t maintain specialism across</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">the genetic bottom-up organization and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.200" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">the connectomic</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">top-down organization because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">influencing each other in real time</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">and so you look at the body as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">complex adaptive system regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">system and then you say</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">our goal is to increase the resilience</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">of the entire system the homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.279" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">capacity of the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">how do we go about doing that and to see</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:40.959" style="s2">disease as</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">where some deviations from homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">exceeded</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">the homeostatic capacity of the system</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:48.639" style="s2">leading to pathophysiology and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">then bring that back and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.639" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">restore system resilience</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking at an ecosystem or</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">human civilization systems they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">complex adaptive systems where</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:02.399" style="s2">the goal similarly the economics and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">environment are inter-affecting each</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.399" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">inexorably right the all the social</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">governance law or inter-affecting</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">and so you have to say well again</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">what would a really resilient system</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">look like and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to look like exponential</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">growth of a materials economy on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:26.560" style="s2">finite planet there&#39;s just no way</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">that could ever be resilient right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.560" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">not going to look like for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">a military-industrial complex while</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:34.399" style="s2">trying to create peace or for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">sick care while trying to create health</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.399" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">was not going to look like places where</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">the incentives are misaligned with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">and so you say well what would a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">resilient system look like</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">and so very like why humanitarian aid</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">why all of our approaches to peace and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">security and global problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">haven&#39;t been working</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">is the exact same reason allopathic</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">medicine doesn&#39;t work for complex issues</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:14:00.000" style="s2">i mean we very much have an allopathic</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">system of governance</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:03.920" style="s2">that is dealing with symptoms rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">than causes dealing with things as</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.920" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">separate issues that really are</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">interconnected issues so</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">you know we apply the same systems for</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">looking at medicine in the body</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">because they are complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">optimization</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">now why we started focusing on bringing</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">solutions for future of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">science which would include what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">called medicine in the past</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:27.360" style="s2">how to move from disease states to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">wellness states but</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.360" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">also how to maintain and optimize and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">continuously evolve states of higher and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">well-being higher and higher system</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">resilience and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">starting not in the medicine space but</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">in the optimization space with neural</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">hypercollective and specifically in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">mind brain space how do we optimize the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">mind brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">interface for optimally sovereign humans</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">humans whose agency whose intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">whose sentience are all</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">you know evolving and interconnectedly</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">evolving</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">the reason why that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">critical things that has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">for all of the meaningful shifts that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">have to happen on the planet-wide level</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">when we look at all of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:09.199" style="s2">we want to change whether we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">about violence</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.199" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">you know at a crime level or violence at</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">a war level</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.480" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">or violence against nature at a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">biodiversity loss level</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">or like all of those issues that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">trying to address</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2">are caused by human behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">all of the solutions we want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">about have to come from human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">so then the question becomes</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">what are all the things that influence</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">human behavior and that can influence it</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">in destructive or constructive</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">directions</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">and obviously economics influences human</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">behavior if if you create an economic</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:42.639" style="s2">where war is profitable or an economic</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">system where a whale</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.639" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">is worth a million dollars dead on</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">a fishing boat but is worth nothing</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">and you can keep throwing them but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.440" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">never going to reach for them because</p>

<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:41.679" style="s2">no matter how hard you try so i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">you know there is a role for that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.679" end="00:18:46.000" style="s2">disease model aspect but</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">you know we&#39;re with the advances we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.000" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">i mean this is something that we need</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">this new approach to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">and you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve ventured into</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">realm with the neurohacker collective</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.039" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">qualia product that you have created</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">with that is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">an amazing product to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">uh human function yeah so we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">the future of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">well-being science more than we talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">about the future of medicine because</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">is the system of uh how do we deal</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">with illness and of course once illness</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">is there</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">our well-being science system already</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">failed</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">our goal is to maintain and optimize and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.919" style="s2">evolve well-being</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">and then of course there there will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.919" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">times where something happens right</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">there&#39;s some deviation from homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond the system&#39;s capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">so we come in to help</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">bring you know help resolve it but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">goal is recognizing that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">the system&#39;s own self-organization that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">is what makes the person better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">just now what things do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">help supply the system with so it can do</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">that so coming to uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">jumping forward and if if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">interesting to get into how we define</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">and well-being how we define illness how</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">we define aging</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">we can do that in pretty formal ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">that are useful so we can come back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">okay the goal qualia specifically was</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">it&#39;s the first product</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">that we brought to the market as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">of well-being enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">support and specifically well-being</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">in the direction of increasing quality</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">of subjective experience and</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">certain aspects of performance</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">capability that are aligned with what</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">would traditionally think of associated</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">with cognitive enhancement but</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">take it a step up we think of what we</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">call sovereignty enhancement we define</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">sovereignty in a bigger way than i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">most people are used to thinking of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">we define sovereignty as the product</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">of three orthonormal vectors x y z</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">axis so one of them is intelligence one</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">is sentience one is</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">agency so intelligence is one&#39;s ability</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">process all kinds of information so</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">critical thinking and systemic thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">and total body of knowledge and memory</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">focus information</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">uh speed of processing is all things</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:08.640" style="s2">associated with intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">sentience is one&#39;s depth and subtlety</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.640" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">and robustness of uh feeling right of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">sensing of experiencing so</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">empathy and mindfulness and awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">self and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">other you know all those things live in</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">sentience</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">ability to maintain their integrity as</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">an individual and then act in the</p>

<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">in the universe functionally so will</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">drive responsibility follow through all</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">those things so if you think of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.039" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">three as x y z axes and you think of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">kind of whichever the shortest one is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">defines volume of a sphere</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to grow that sphere and uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">so when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">think of the fact that you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:51.200" style="s2">know very well</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">someone&#39;s certain hormones being out of</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">mindfulness can affect their</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">cognition you know various aspects of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">addressing the physiology of it is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">sufficient we also have to address the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:11.360" style="s2">psychology of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:12.960" style="s2">and the you know what we kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.360" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">of as the human software side but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.960" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">human hardware side is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">and so we&#39;re saying what can we do to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">support the underlying aspects of human</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">physiology that are involved in all of</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">to optimize uh and involve human</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">sovereignty so quality is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">first thing we brought to market to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">support those</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:33.760" style="s2">processes and you know it was several</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">years of r d where we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.760" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">personalized versions of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">in clinical settings i&#39;m sure similar to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">how you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">and then realizing that when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">when we were looking at complex you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">blood chemistry genomes etc</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">there were some things that were very</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">different from one person to the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">and how to bring that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">personalized well-being science to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">masses</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">is in our uh goal set but there were</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">many things that were common across</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">most people that were key to systems</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">optimization and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:05.919" style="s2">those were the early products were able</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">to start uh developing</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.919" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">well the thing that really impressed me</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">about this i mean you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">we do epigenetics and we do</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">nutrigenomics in our practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">and you know this is basically a bottle</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">full of uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">of nutrigenomic modifiers i had looked</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">into developing</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">a powder that included some of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">but what excited me was when i&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">through this i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:33.919" style="s2">you you had taken what was the concept</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">in my mind and taken it to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">just a whole new level with with what</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">you put in this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">and it was not only a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">but the actual dosages which you rarely</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">see in supplements at dosage levels that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">are equivalent to what the research is</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">showing i mean when i saw acetyl</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">l-carnitine at 800 milligrams algal dha</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">at 200 milligrams even bacopa monaria</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:02.799" style="s2">which is one of my favorite supplements</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">at 300 milligrams ben fatia mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.799" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">mucuna to help boost dopamine in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">brain all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">were just really impressive for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">to to see that even adding the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">uridine</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">to the supplement in order to help with</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">the choline utilization</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">boost choline i mean you just don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">that in supplements</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">and it was exciting to see this and when</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">i started recommending it to my clients</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">and i hadn&#39;t even taken it yet they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">reporting back to me how</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">outstanding they felt on this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">i have to say there&#39;s one thing though</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:41.279" style="s2">that i would love to see in it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s holy basil which uh if i could</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.279" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">say there&#39;s one thing that would make</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">this thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">just perfect it would be holy basil</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">the process of how we developed it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">actually really fun i think you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">appreciate so we started from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">cognitive science point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">saying all right so what are all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">these subjective states</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">and capabilities cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">you know other neurologically related</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:05.200" style="s2">capabilities that</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">we&#39;re wanting to affect for people here</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.200" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">and that people are wanting when they go</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">energy drinks or off-label smart drugs</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">or uh whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:15.279" style="s2">so we we modeled that out it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">with short-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">and speed of memory and long-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">and verbal fluency</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">and digit span and arithmetic processing</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">and analytic thinking and synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">thinking and creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">focus and attention span you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">those cognitive metrics</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">and things like drive and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">resilience</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">with increased presence and subjective</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:40.240" style="s2">flow state and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to get that right</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.240" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">first because if you have just a subset</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">of it you&#39;re seeking to optimize a</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">subset of that it&#39;ll usually be at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">cost of some of the other important</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">metrics so</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">this is what&#39;s so commonly reported when</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">someone is using</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">a smart drug like adderall for off-label</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">purposes they&#39;ll increase</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">a part of their dopamine pathway without</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">the rest of the aspects of their</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">dopamine pathway or any of the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">neurotransmitter or other</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">you know kind of key neurologic pathways</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">such that they do have increased</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">say focus but maybe at the cost of other</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">important cognitive metrics like</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">aspects of memory and processing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">definitely at the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">you know say the ability for task</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">switching which can lead to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">more aggravation irritability anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">and then of course you also have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">ability to i mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">if you use a exogenous override of an</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">endogenous regulatory system</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to decrease the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">regulatory capacity of that system i.e</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">dependence down regulation and addiction</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">and so our goal was how do we work</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">through the endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">pathways such that if someone used this</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">for some period of time and then stopped</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">rather than be down regulated and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">addicted they would actually have their</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">baseline elevated</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">and so we&#39;re really supporting you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">endogenous regulatory capacity so we</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">started with modeling</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">all right here&#39;s all the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">wanting to affect subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">performatively</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">then we went through all the literature</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.559" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">of all the various sciences that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">could and said</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">what do we know across all the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">of which</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:08.720" style="s2">aspects of physiology mediate and relate</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.720" end="00:27:14.559" style="s2">those aspects of psychology and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">you know if we&#39;re talking about memory</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.559" end="00:27:17.279" style="s2">there&#39;s asp you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that we know about</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">acetylcholine about glutamate about</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">catecholamines about specific receptor</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">sites about</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">specific kinds of synaptic processes so</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">we started modeling all of that out to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">develop the whole interconnected set of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">underlying physiology that we&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:37.200" style="s2">be up regulating and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">the whole regulatory pathways associated</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.200" end="00:27:42.320" style="s2">to say we&#39;re wanting to up regulate</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">these biosystems right and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:46.320" style="s2">that&#39;s going to get all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">the whole system but in a weighted</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.320" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">and then we looked at what chemistries</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">mapped to being able to support those</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">systems and we got</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">a list of 500 or so chemicals that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">we had a lot of data on and then we</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">started looking at which ones</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">are safe across the other systems you</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">know have good safety data which ones</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">have synergistic effects across multiple</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">and then we paired it down to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">particular 42</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">ingredients and those specific doses</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">and the doses for some things seem high</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">compared to other supplements sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">they seem lower than someone would want</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">it&#39;s on purpose because say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">looking at the macuna for the l-dopa</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:30.799" style="s2">well we&#39;ve got dlpa so you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">phenylalanine which will be converting</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.799" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">into tyrosine</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">and then acetyl tyrosine and then l-dopa</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.559" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">and then dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">so if you look at the fact that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">got the phenylalanine and acetyl</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">tyrosine and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">l-dopa and the you know p5p that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">of the conversion process and some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">minerals and vitamins are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">conversion process and then things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">are going to support</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">synaptic transporter proteins endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">mao b</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:57.279" style="s2">inhibitors things that will sensitize d1</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">d2 receptors</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.279" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">you can&#39;t use the same dose of each of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">those things that were effective in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">isolation when you start having</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">synergies across the whole pathway so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">started really</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">looking at how do we have you know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">effective doses for optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">flow through pathways and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">interaction between pathways like</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.679" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">dopamine with the rest of catecholamines</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">with acetylcholine and glutamate with</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">the underlying cell energy processes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:23.039" style="s2">and then deeper things like neurogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">and synaptogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.039" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">with regard to holy basil holy basil is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">a beautiful herb obviously</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">adaptogenically especially for</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:33.679" style="s2">ubiquitous adrenal stress you&#39;ll notice</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">that we have the phosphatidylserine</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">which has many of the similar effects in</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">hpa adaptogenic effects on</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">you know serotonin acth et cetera we</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">actually found</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">enough people that did not respond well</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">to holy basil that it didn&#39;t make it in</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">the were the kinds of people that were</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:53.760" style="s2">looking for the effects primarily that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">we&#39;d have here</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.760" end="00:29:57.120" style="s2">that it didn&#39;t make it in this final cut</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">but it was definitely used in many of</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.120" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">the versions and we will have products</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">coming out that will include it</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">yeah one of the the the aspect i like</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:07.120" style="s2">about holy basil</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">is that the neuroplasticity and the bdnf</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.120" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">increases that you get with the holy</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">basil and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">that&#39;s been my finding with it in</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">clinical practice as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s anecdotal but</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">the cool thing about it is it raises it</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">causes increased expression of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">fndc5 in the muscle which goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:29.840" style="s2">liver and gets converted to irisin which</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">goes to the brain and boosts bdnf</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.840" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">which is the main purpose that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">typically focus in on</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">with the with the holy basil but i</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">love this this whole approach that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">have with</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">looking at enhancing existing systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:47.039" style="s2">supplanting the system and i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.039" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">a lot of medicine has gone awry is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:53.200" style="s2">in medicine</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2">we focus and even in in wellness in</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.200" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:58.640" style="s2">i mean we focus on trying to supplant</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">the body&#39;s a beautiful system the body</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.640" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">is an amazingly complex system that</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">for us to even have the concept that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">can micromanage it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">is is just mind-blowing and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">so even with with like all these</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">antioxidants that people take i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:15.360" style="s2">come on</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re producing uh what one times</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.360" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">10 to the 24th free radicals a day and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">you think that taking vitamin c and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">these high doses is going to make that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">big of a difference in that system</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">is just ludicrous i mean you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">and you say well it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">system&#39;s broken it&#39;s not the free</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">radicals are bad i mean we produce free</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">radicals for a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">so what we need to do is boost the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">body&#39;s management capabilities of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">so boost the system that actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">handles it</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">give it that that little kick to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">i&#39;m going to keep you in a healthy state</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">so that you can do this rather than me</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">trying to micromanage it and i love the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">way you&#39;ve done that with this product</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">yeah so there you know if you say how do</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">we can giving glutathione have benefit</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">for people totally does boosting</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">endogenous glutathione production have</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">more benefit</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">obviously then is there an excessive</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">need on glutathione</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">as a whole because of you know some</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">increased toxic exposure or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">that we could address or</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">or you know chronic subclinical</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.600" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">pathogens so we can do things to help</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:13.120" style="s2">of course so it&#39;s it is a very deep and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:14.240" style="s2">nuanced thing i think the thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.120" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.240" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">you know i really love hearing you say</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">the respect and reverence for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">intelligence of the body and nature and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">universe rather than it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a dumb system and so we have to fix</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">it you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">when you mention 10 to the 24th free</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">radicals per day and what is what do we</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">really think it means to manage that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">when we think about a trillion metabolic</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">functions per second per cell give or</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">right and and the synchrony of all those</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">there is just radical parallel</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">processing happening every</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">cell having its own internal processing</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:49.120" style="s2">dynamics that then are interacting and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">not just every cell but every organelle</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.120" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">all the way down to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">fundamental physics of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">and so there is no way to top down</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">manage that</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">in fact we can mathematically prove it</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">right we can prove that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">that it is an np complete issue that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:06.399" style="s2">non-computable</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">so then we say well how do we support</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.399" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">those endogenous regulatory systems and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">that is a very different approach to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:14.320" style="s2">well-being science</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">you&#39;re listening to the iron man</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.320" end="00:33:18.279" style="s2">executive with dr daniel stukler</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">be sure to check out the ironman</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">now back to the ironman executive show</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.559" end="00:33:33.279" style="s2">well i want to shift gears a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">because i wanted to get to this during</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">this interview but</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">talking about most of my listeners are</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.519" style="s2">major biohackers uh they&#39;re all about</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">you know trying different things uh the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.519" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">n equals one</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">approach and i don&#39;t actually prefer</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">that term biohacking i</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">i prefer optimizing human potential in</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">uh biohacking just seems almost in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">hedonic realm</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">but um you guys use the the term</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">neurohacking</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">and where do you see this this</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">neurohacking going i mean what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">what&#39;s the future process of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">neurohacking that you see</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">so just two quick little philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">you mentioned a couple times uh that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">goal of future medicine is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">purely hedonic or the future of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">optimization</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">that old split between haydon and daemon</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:24.960" style="s2">is actually one of the nonsense things</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">we have to dichotomies we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.960" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">reconcile so when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">optimizing human</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">experience and human capability</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">having a underlying philosophic model</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">shows that the way that people</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">contribute to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">is actually optimal for their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">quality of life experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">and as their quality of life goes up</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">it increases their capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">predisposition to contribute to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:51.440" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">very much in the same way that a cell</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">relates to the whole body right the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">human relates to humanity and to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">universe and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">we would not throw out hedonism we would</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">include and transcend it</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">right and i think when you said</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">eudemonia that&#39;s a good word for include</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">and transcend</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:11.200" style="s2">that people&#39;s own experience their</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">experiential tone being optimized is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.200" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">absolutely useful</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">for then optimizing their capability and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">predisposition for serving meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">and vice versa without deep meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">service their qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">personal subjective experience that just</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">don&#39;t happen and so i just</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">i just wanted to mention that real quick</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">the interview i did</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:35.480" style="s2">just uh just two weeks ago with</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">steve cole who is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.480" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">psychoneuroimmunologist at ucla</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">he did a study on hedonism</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:46.960" style="s2">versus eudemonic well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:47.599" style="s2">it blew me away they went into the study</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">him and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.599" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">barbara friedrichson went into the study</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">thinking you know they&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:57.920" style="s2">similar outcomes of positive</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">physiological responses and they found</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">on the psychological scales the hedonics</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">and the eudemonics scored</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">equally well on well-being scores but</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">then when they looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">health of the immune system they started</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:13.520" style="s2">looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">deeper into these epigenetic marks and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.520" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">and blood biomarkers and they found</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:22.480" style="s2">this this is just amazing the hedonic</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">well-being group actually scored lower</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.480" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">than people that had</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">low well-being to begin with while the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">eudemonic groups scored</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">off the chart and in the health of their</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">immune system</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">and yet they appeared the same on</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">psychological tests of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">what that means is that the decreased</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">immunity is going to lead to decreased</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">psychological scores over time</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">right right and so some of the team at</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">neural hacker wrote a really brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">paper on this i think it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">publish soon</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:55.440" style="s2">but um if one is</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">pursuing states of experience that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.440" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">through processes that create momentary</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">spikes but end up eroding baseline then</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">you can have elevated state on the short</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">term and eroded baseline long term</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">if you are pursuing states of experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">where you actually want to evolve the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">baseline</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:14.320" style="s2">itself then it&#39;s a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">approach and this is the two marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.320" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">experiment right we all</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">we all know this but it is very</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">meaningful to say it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:24.240" style="s2">anti-addictive what it ends up creating</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">the highest quality of life which you</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.240" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">could say would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">smart hedonism if someone wants to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">really have highest quality of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">experience that gets higher over time</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:34.400" style="s2">then it&#39;s not about short-term spikes</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s about the evolution of baseline</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">and the evolution of baseline means what</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">actually builds the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">system enduringly</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of confused on that one can you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">explain that one just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">more time somebody goes for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">chocolate cake they feel good in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:49.599" style="s2">moment they feel shitty</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">over time as they eat a lot of chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.599" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">cake because</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">they got a dopamine spike but they got a</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">dopamine spike in a way that affected</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">the rest of their physiology</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">such that it&#39;s going to lead to an</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">imbalance in their dopamine opioid axis</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">and a bunch of other systems so then of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">course as they feel shittier than they</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">crave more</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">dopamine spikes because their baseline</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">is lower</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">right their baseline well-being is lower</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">which then</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">wants to feel better more quickly and as</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">it wants to feel better quickly than</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going to go for whether it was the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.079" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">chocolate cake the cocaine or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">whatever it is that creates a hit</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">and so we can think of addiction as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">eroding base</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">you know some process to increase</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">subjective well-being quickly</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">that actually decreases the integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">the system that lowers the baseline</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">it creates more desperation to then feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">better which</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">leads to doing the same process you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">i got you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">yeah so you&#39;re you were referring to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">the short-term aspects of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">and and how that responds yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">even pursuing hedonism intelligently</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">which says i actually want to feel good</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">but i want to feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">continuously good and progressively more</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">so over a long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">a fundamentally different approach has</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">to be taken i still think that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">to come down to though</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">you know like they they&#39;ve found i mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">in psychological well-being scores the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">people who pursued hedonism on a regular</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">basis they scored very well</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">on that psychological well-being just as</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">well as the ones that were</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">you know living life with a purpose per</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">se but</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">you know i i just i think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">there is some aspects that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">going to experience that hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:27.200" style="s2">approach but i think if we have that</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">overriding purpose</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">that vision of where where we want</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">things to be and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re living towards i mean just you</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">know one of the examples that dr cole</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">used was</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">you know the person who climbs mount</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">everest i mean sure you can look at that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">as potentially a hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">aspect but if they&#39;re doing it to show</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">humanity that that it can be done then</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">psychological aspect to their well-being</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">that they&#39;re utilizing there okay the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">dichotomy that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">speaking to that is worth reconciling is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">there is an</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">old puritan distinction</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">where pleasure is a bad thing and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">particular interpretation and so really</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">we&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">pleasure in the afterlife or something</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:15.040" style="s2">right sacrifice is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">and purpose and meaning end up not being</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:20.079" style="s2">associated with pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">and that distinction is</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">an obsolete one right we can say that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">the highest kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">the pleasure that are very real because</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:30.880" style="s2">like you said you have some</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">psychological scores from people who are</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.880" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">who are focused on their own state</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:36.880" style="s2">versus focused on some larger things</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">that include their own state</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.880" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">and the key is focused on larger</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">purposes but that will end up</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">including their state rather than</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">excluding it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:51.359" style="s2">so as people pursue being of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">use to larger than themselves that will</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.359" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">end up</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:54.800" style="s2">inexorably leading to them feeling</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.800" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">and as to the degree that people</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">actually feel better they will have more</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.720" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">resources to show up more</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">so we would just like i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">have people think about</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">advancing their own subjective quality</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">of life</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">and advancing their utility to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">as being inner symbiotic with each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:15.359" style="s2">i completely agree with that i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:16.640" style="s2">that uh that kind of brings it all</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">together there and uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.640" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">and makes a lot of sense to me you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">my goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">get to the point where we can reverse</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.839" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">age and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">and obviously it does have a hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">component to it but in</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">in a sense it&#39;s more about an</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">over overriding uh for</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">me to be helping to create this new</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.440" style="s2">paradigm and to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">advance humanity in that regard because</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">i see it as possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:46.400" style="s2">and people will look at it and say you</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:49.280" style="s2">know it&#39;s hedonistic to want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.400" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">live forever well no not necessarily i</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.280" end="00:41:52.000" style="s2">can see that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">in that and what you just used as the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.000" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">example there maybe we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:58.319" style="s2">an opportunity a show to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">approaches to the future of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.319" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">anti-aging sometimes that would be cool</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that is my uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">my passion for sure so going down that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.440" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">road a little bit and uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">and i know we&#39;re running a little short</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">on time but i want to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">what your vision is to take a look at 10</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">years down the road</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">where do you see medicine and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">just life in general</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">i mean we&#39;re at this exponential growth</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">phase of technology and science</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">and 10 years is a is a millennium</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">what can we achieve in that amount of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:32.240" style="s2">time if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">think not just about individual</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.240" end="00:42:36.720" style="s2">technologies but we think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">technological ecosystems that create</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">synergistic capacities across the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.480" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">ecosystem i think it&#39;s that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">meaningful thing to think about for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">next 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">because we could just talk about robots</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">that do surgery better and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">individual diagnostic technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">individual therapeutic technologies but</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">it&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">that entire system&#39;s capability that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">i think we will see some</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">radical progress in diagnostic and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">assessment technologies</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">that&#39;ll be things like the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">mass spec for metabolomics and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">home metabolomics so the quantified self</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:13.520" style="s2">devices move from</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">relatively small number of metrics to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.520" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">lot of metrics and a lot of fidelity of</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">information that leads to big data</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">at the level of individuals i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">that&#39;ll be a huge</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">thing i think we&#39;ll probably even do</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">some further out stuff like laser</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">interferometry</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">for testing more blood metrics without</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:31.119" style="s2">even pricking the blood we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.119" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">like you know nanobiosen technologies</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:37.760" style="s2">for being able to do advanced pcr-like</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">technology from a single drop of blood</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">so i think ubiquitous data</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">bio data about people and then cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">and psychological data</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">will lead to our ability to do of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">assessment across lots of people but</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.400" end="00:43:53.920" style="s2">also even big data</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">on a single individual because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.920" end="00:43:57.920" style="s2">frequency of testing and all the things</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">that we get a test that will lead to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">you know early disease indicators also</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:02.880" style="s2">what we would call</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">you know need for support system</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.880" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">resilience indicators</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">but that tremendous amount of data will</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">have to be processed on</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.040" style="s2">different kinds of processing platforms</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.839" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">so i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.040" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">combinatorial ai</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">interpretive platforms are going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">really key thing to be able to say all</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">right so we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:23.440" style="s2">inflammatory metrics we have nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">metrics we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.440" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">you know proteomic transcriptomic</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">metabolomic etc all this data</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">how do we look at each of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">biometrics not just in relationship to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">reference range but in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:37.359" style="s2">all the other metrics</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">and see how those metrics are affecting</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.359" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">each other and how the causal cascades</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">which things move first in response to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">behaviors or environmental stimuli that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">then lead to other things moving that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:49.839" style="s2">lead to recursive effects</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">and so and this is a this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.839" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">unique kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:55.520" style="s2">ai and it will actually require the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:58.880" style="s2">evolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.520" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">understanding of the of the ontology</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:04.240" style="s2">of human physiology how the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:06.319" style="s2">regulatory systems interact so we take</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">kind of a complex adaptive systems and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.319" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">cybernetic view of the human as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">as a complex regulatory system adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:15.599" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">and it allows us to then not just be</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.599" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">machine learning on big data but</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">actually knowing what to look for for</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.960" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">complex causal</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">dynamics so that it actually drops that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">nearly infinite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">information back into computable sets</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">and then i think therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">technologies will be getting better</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">on the medicine side in terms of i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">already seeing immuno oncology it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the first things coming out</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:45.520" style="s2">what we call traditional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">pharmaceutical medicine that is for</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.520" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t acute that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">actually great right so really</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">happy to see that i think there will be</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:55.359" style="s2">a lot in terms of therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">technologies for</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">infection many different kinds mucosal</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">infection</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.760" style="s2">humeral cellular infection for toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">and subclinical kind of detox</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.760" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s another key thing is the really</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">understanding subclinical pathology</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">and how to assess it and address it</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">and then of course how to prevent it</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">understanding more about</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:21.040" style="s2">genetic expression and how to modulate</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:22.880" style="s2">genetic expression</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">so there will be therapeutic dynamics at</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:27.760" style="s2">each of those levels and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">the key of what we&#39;ll be coming to is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.760" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">moving towards personalized medicine not</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">at a personalized towards a few snips in</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:38.240" style="s2">someone&#39;s genome or even common torques</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:40.480" style="s2">of the genome but personalized to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:42.400" style="s2">all of that data that we have so we stop</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">thinking about ms as a disease or</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">rheumatoid arthritis as a disease</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">we start and we stop even thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">cognitive enhancement as a thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">optimized a certain way give them a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:52.800" style="s2">rassa tamar</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">we start thinking about all of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.800" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">different pathways that are involved</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">and the causal cascades the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">multifactorial causal cascade so we see</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">someone&#39;s ms there might be thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">pathways that can contribute to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">deviation from homeostasis that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">ms and anyone&#39;s ms might be some</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">weighted subset and when i say ms i</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">could mean anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">alzheimer&#39;s anything right some weighted</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">subset of those factors that led to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">pathophysiology so then we</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">can know how to do differential</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">diagnosis across the whole underlying</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">causal set</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">possible causal set right the causal</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">phase base see what specific things are</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">and then not be treating a disease</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">cluster but treating</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">the specific pathways that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">and again where sometimes we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">specifically reversing some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">pathology</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">but we&#39;re primarily focused on</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">increasing</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">system resilience and homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">capacity for the body to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">that across</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">all kinds of dynamics and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">increasing efficiency of cellular</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:59.760" style="s2">function increasing efficiency of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:00.800" style="s2">mucosal membranes you know etc yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.760" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">agree with you and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.800" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">i would even take it a step further i</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">mean i in 10 years i mean with what</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:08.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve got going on right now with crispr</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">technology and you know i&#39;m interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.319" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">a lot of the people in the field right</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:16.000" style="s2">crispr the nanobots uh all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:17.480" style="s2">i think within 10 years i mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.000" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">it absolutely is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.480" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">bioinformatics</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">field no doubt about that but i i</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">really do see that we are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:28.960" style="s2">stepping away from disease models</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">it&#39;s just not going to exist i mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.960" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to take care</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">of cancers we&#39;re going to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">heart disease before it even</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">comes about and if it does come about</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;ll be something that they can go in</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">and do some editing on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">on the immune system and create a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">response that is ideal</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">and we have a tool right now with crispr</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s like given this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">being given a uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">teleporter and not have and not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">how it&#39;s used or or anything like that i</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a technology that is ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">our knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.440" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">and i think once we start to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.000" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">to use this</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">i mean this technology i mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">crispr for your home basement to do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:11.920" style="s2">do lab work in your basement i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">that&#39;s how simple this technology is but</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.920" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">amazing what comes out of this and</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:19.119" style="s2">nanotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">on top of that i mean i just uh i really</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.119" end="00:49:23.839" style="s2">see a whole new realm</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">of of health uh and i think physicians</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.839" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">a little need for physicians most of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">time i mean you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2">looking at computer ai bioinformatics</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">systems you&#39;re going to be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:38.720" style="s2">that can compute much greater amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">details than the human brain can</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.720" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">process as a clinician so you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">them running the show for these things</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:49.040" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s going to be an exciting</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">time yeah so when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">exponential technology and medicine</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:56.960" style="s2">so thing technology that enables more</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">technology of its kind on exponential</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.960" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">curves so we think of nanotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">synthetic biology crispr genome editing</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">ai et cetera one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">things is of course</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">you&#39;re getting so much more rate of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">change right so much more change per</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:11.839" style="s2">unit time and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">continuously so that we can&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.839" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">same adaptive time periods we&#39;ve had in</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:16.079" style="s2">the past and our intuitions from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:18.800" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.079" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">are less and less adequate at the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.800" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">our chance of things up</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">increases exponentially too because</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">any increased power and we&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">all of the major environmental problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:35.359" style="s2">that we see in the world or the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:38.079" style="s2">application of humans using technology</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.359" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">and even you know so many of them in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.079" end="00:50:40.480" style="s2">biotech right that we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">health issues</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">technology has increased power</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:47.040" style="s2">especially if it&#39;s not already</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">a self-organizing system has the ability</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">to have positive and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">destructive applications and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">destructive not intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">but because we just didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">the full causal dynamics that were</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">and so with crispr for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:04.880" style="s2">reductionist approach of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">single nucleotide polymorphism does this</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.880" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">thing so we&#39;re going to remove it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">you know from the genome let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.599" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">take apoe4 but then we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">get indication of the role of apoe4 and</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">immune function and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.960" style="s2">automatically lead to alzheimer&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">leads to increased predisposition if</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.960" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">environmentally triggered in some way so</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:26.640" style="s2">i it&#39;s not that i&#39;m not you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">fascinated by crispr we we</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.640" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">spend a lot of time with it but i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">that it is critical that we come to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">complex systems dynamics much much</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">better than we are even currently close</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">before we think we understand them well</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">enough to</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">edit the self-organizing code itself and</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">so in</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.200" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">as we are working towards that affecting</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">genetic expression through epigenetic</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">switches and through neutrogenomics</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">is awesome and genome editing requires</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">us increasing our level of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:00.720" style="s2">well and i think even when we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:03.839" style="s2">point of the genome editing</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.720" end="00:52:06.400" style="s2">you&#39;re still going to be having to deal</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.839" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">with this whole biospherical system</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">of the body interacting i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.640" end="00:52:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">the expression of 23 000 genes to make</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.240" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">over a million proteins</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot going on between the code</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.760" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">itself and the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:22.160" style="s2">and and i think that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:24.480" style="s2">epigenetics is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">going away we may get better at it but</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.480" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">it&#39;s still going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:32.319" style="s2">major network of complex interactions</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">that just basically will come down to</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.319" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:36.079" style="s2">living the lifestyle that that promotes</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">the most optimal</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">function of the human being yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">more thing i&#39;ll say about the future of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">medicine and well-being that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:46.240" style="s2">mentioned but that i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">critical and i&#39;m sure you talk with your</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">audience about it often is</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:53.920" style="s2">if we see before someone is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">would normally be diagnosed with lupus</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.920" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">or some kind of rheumatism or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">we see certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">autoimmune antibodies expressing we see</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:02.559" style="s2">certain cytokines expressing well we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">say okay so</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.559" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">this inflammatory marker causes this</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">illness or we see</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">certain hormones out of balance before</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">another illness</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">obviously what that means is that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">inflammatory marker</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">that hormone was part of a causal</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">cascade but it was not the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">the causal cascade</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">right those are messenger molecules</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">there&#39;s something upstream from that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">we can go all the way upstream and say</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">what would the tier one</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">deviation from the homeostatic integrity</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">of the system b</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">that leads to that process and you say</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">all right well</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">health is defined as the homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:39.599" style="s2">capacity not being in homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">but the total homeostatic capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.599" end="00:53:43.119" style="s2">the system and more robust health means</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:44.800" style="s2">more homeostatic resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.119" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">ability to handle larger stressors</p>
