<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">oh man yeah I mean typically the only</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">framing of my work</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">that seems sustainable is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">having conversations with people that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">find fascinating that I&#39;m curious about</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">and increasingly that I experience some</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">kind of like erotic pull towards not</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">sexual but just like I want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:54.509" style="s2">know what it is that they how they see</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">the world and as soon as I put any kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.509" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">of like loftier vision of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:00.810" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing I noticed that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:02.820" style="s2">excitement for myself around the project</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.810" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">starts to dry up so I try to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.820" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">pretty simple like that and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">what I hope it accomplishes I mean my</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:20.910" style="s2">dream my dream would be that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">listen to it and like have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.910" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">taking greater responsibility for their</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:31.770" style="s2">life that&#39;s not yeah since you have an</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:33.560" style="s2">obvious spiritual or religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.770" end="00:02:35.670" style="s2">orientation do you think of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.560" end="00:02:41.490" style="s2">conversations when they work well as</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.670" end="00:02:43.980" style="s2">being a kind of extended Sangha for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.490" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">certainly yeah I mean the network that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.980" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">found myself embedded in since I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">started the emerge project is profound</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">and and you know I just came out of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">seventy five day retreat and it was it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">was interesting because on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:02:58.470" style="s2">I came out into my physical community</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:00.510" style="s2">here at the monastic Academy I was kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.470" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2">of received and I got to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.510" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">reintegrate into that whole and at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">same time I started to kind of enter</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:11.310" style="s2">back into this online new sphere this</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">global or planetary Sangha that I found</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.310" end="00:03:16.440" style="s2">myself now to be a part of and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">been very interesting to have those two</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.440" end="00:03:20.880" style="s2">reentry&#39;s happen side by side so it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">certainly functions as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.880" end="00:03:24.870" style="s2">extended Sangha for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t know to what degree it does for</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.870" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">others you know the unfortunate fact is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">that podcasting is a broadcast medium</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:37.500" style="s2">and Sangha for me I think has to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">two-way or you know omnidirectional to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.500" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">really be Sangha so yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2">something like that in myself which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:47.160" style="s2">what I asked you know I I&#39;m split</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:49.700" style="s2">between on the one hand thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.160" end="00:03:52.320" style="s2">Dharma its broadest sense as being an</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.700" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">existing body of wisdom to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.320" end="00:03:58.950" style="s2">receive and on the other hands a set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:01.170" style="s2">conversational skills that allows wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.950" end="00:04:03.390" style="s2">to be regenerated within any cultural or</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.170" end="00:04:08.370" style="s2">historical context as long as the my</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.390" end="00:04:10.920" style="s2">conversations are going on hmm beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.370" end="00:04:13.800" style="s2">yeah I mean I love that one of one of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.920" end="00:04:16.100" style="s2">teachers Rob birdy who just recently</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.800" end="00:04:19.350" style="s2">passed away talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.100" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">simultaneity of creating and discovering</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.350" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">right so we&#39;re constantly creating and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">discovering they&#39;re not actually set</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve got word really that means both of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:27.180" style="s2">those things at once so we have to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">create and discover</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.180" end="00:04:33.090" style="s2">and that that for me is very much a part</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:37.380" style="s2">of call it a religious movement but what</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.090" end="00:04:47.160" style="s2">this is all about for me why call it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.380" end="00:04:48.449" style="s2">emerge the honest answer is that I used</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.160" end="00:04:50.009" style="s2">to work for a company called Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.449" end="00:04:53.970" style="s2">geeks which was like a kind of og</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.009" end="00:04:57.180" style="s2">podcasting media company and my friend</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.970" end="00:05:03.599" style="s2">Vince horn who started it I was with him</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.180" end="00:05:06.810" style="s2">as he explored the limits of Buddhism as</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.599" end="00:05:08.729" style="s2">a container for his inquiry and ran up</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.810" end="00:05:10.470" style="s2">against the limits of that and started</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.729" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">to kind of almost represent Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.470" end="00:05:15.720" style="s2">even though when he started it he loved</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.330" end="00:05:18.870" style="s2">Buddhism it was the love of his life</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.720" end="00:05:21.449" style="s2">and so I very conspicuously and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.870" end="00:05:25.860" style="s2">intentionally picked a kind of container</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.449" end="00:05:30.660" style="s2">or a title or framing that would never</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.860" end="00:05:32.789" style="s2">feel constraint and so emerge is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.660" end="00:05:35.639" style="s2">kind of sense of like oh there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.789" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">something new there&#39;s always some new</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.639" end="00:05:40.169" style="s2">way of seeing there&#39;s always some new</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:44.820" style="s2">way of being in relationship to life or</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.169" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">to the world or to others that I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.820" end="00:05:48.210" style="s2">explore and that&#39;s calling me forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:49.889" style="s2">there&#39;s always some new complexities and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.210" end="00:05:50.940" style="s2">they&#39;re nuanced and I don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.889" end="00:05:53.729" style="s2">that&#39;s going to come from you know it</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.940" end="00:05:57.860" style="s2">might come from sociology it might come</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.729" end="00:06:00.539" style="s2">from primitive skills it might come from</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.860" end="00:06:02.699" style="s2">philosophy it might come from theology</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.539" end="00:06:05.310" style="s2">it might come from technology it might</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.699" end="00:06:07.289" style="s2">come from some emerging discipline I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.310" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">don&#39;t even know about yet and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.289" end="00:06:15.030" style="s2">be free to explore them all nice very</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:17.400" style="s2">open yeah yeah there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.030" end="00:06:19.800" style="s2">philosophies around emergence as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.400" end="00:06:21.419" style="s2">the leading edge of the development of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:24.900" style="s2">the universe but there&#39;s also this sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.419" end="00:06:26.970" style="s2">in which emerging is the alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.900" end="00:06:28.949" style="s2">asserting something where if you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.970" end="00:06:31.139" style="s2">sort of inspect what&#39;s there and see</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.949" end="00:06:34.050" style="s2">what you can find in it then what</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.139" end="00:06:37.169" style="s2">emerges is something more pure more</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.050" end="00:06:39.270" style="s2">embodied richer than if you&#39;ve just made</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.169" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">an assertion and I think I heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.270" end="00:06:42.590" style="s2">somewhere that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:45.500" style="s2">you sort of have an allergy to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.590" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">totalizing narratives we can makes me</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.500" end="00:06:49.310" style="s2">think of you you know working in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:52.009" style="s2">medium where you&#39;re open to organic</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.310" end="00:06:53.780" style="s2">richness and deviance and complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.009" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">plurality in the conversation what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.780" end="00:06:59.539" style="s2">wonder is has that always been an</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">attitude you&#39;ve had or is that a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.539" end="00:07:07.250" style="s2">a the result of some insights that</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:09.110" style="s2">you&#39;ve developed over time as a result</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.250" end="00:07:11.270" style="s2">of insights I&#39;ve had over time I used to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.110" end="00:07:14.150" style="s2">be a very totalizing kind of in my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.270" end="00:07:16.100" style="s2">way fundamentalist sort of personality I</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.150" end="00:07:21.860" style="s2">was kind of known for it actually I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.100" end="00:07:23.570" style="s2">in I was a first ranked member of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.860" end="00:07:25.490" style="s2">debate team in my college and I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.570" end="00:07:28.190" style="s2">kind of intellectually humiliate people</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.490" end="00:07:30.100" style="s2">through my kind of like almost looking</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.190" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">back on a kind of authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.100" end="00:07:33.830" style="s2">perspective-taking and I was very good</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:37.340" style="s2">at that and I actually got rewarded for</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.830" end="00:07:39.620" style="s2">it and I was you know I kind of loved it</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.340" end="00:07:42.530" style="s2">because I valid validated in some kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.620" end="00:07:44.750" style="s2">of my intellectual identity I had but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.530" end="00:07:47.180" style="s2">think really once I started meditating</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.750" end="00:07:52.039" style="s2">in earnest and and that their theory of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.180" end="00:07:54.919" style="s2">mind and kind of really contemplated how</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.039" end="00:07:57.740" style="s2">I want to be alive then that quickly</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.919" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">fell away it became obvious that taking</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.740" end="00:08:03.470" style="s2">a totalizing perspective or reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:06.919" style="s2">way things are into any single narrative</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.470" end="00:08:11.690" style="s2">or conceptual vision is just a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.919" end="00:08:15.849" style="s2">violence on life that not only isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.690" end="00:08:19.479" style="s2">true but for me more importantly just</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.849" end="00:08:22.010" style="s2">destroys beauty and aliveness which are</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.479" end="00:08:27.320" style="s2">to a large degree what I want to uplift</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.010" end="00:08:31.130" style="s2">I in everything I do nice what do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.320" end="00:08:34.580" style="s2">think are the skills required to have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.130" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">good conversation that&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.580" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">beautiful question</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.400" end="00:08:43.690" style="s2">first impulse is to just put back on you</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.020" end="00:08:46.020" style="s2">and ask you where your you&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.690" end="00:08:48.400" style="s2">from with that I mean there&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.020" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">dialogical is this meant to be actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.400" end="00:08:54.760" style="s2">I&#39;d like to know oh we could go as far</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:56.590" style="s2">as you like in either direction hmm okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.760" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">I mean if you want to go back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.590" end="00:09:02.050" style="s2">I&#39;m fine with it to really answer that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:03.790" style="s2">question I would have to know what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.050" end="00:09:05.080" style="s2">mean by good conversation like what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.790" end="00:09:07.720" style="s2">what&#39;s in that for you what&#39;s wrapped up</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.080" end="00:09:10.150" style="s2">in that yeah I would kind of think of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.720" end="00:09:12.310" style="s2">in two senses on the one hand like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.150" end="00:09:15.730" style="s2">colloquial sense of a good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.310" end="00:09:17.800" style="s2">where when you&#39;re done you feel richer</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.730" end="00:09:20.440" style="s2">you feel more energized you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.800" end="00:09:22.630" style="s2">waste your time in predictable modes</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.440" end="00:09:25.180" style="s2">nobody would suck anybody else&#39;s energy</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.630" end="00:09:27.910" style="s2">or sabotage did and it got somewhere you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.180" end="00:09:30.870" style="s2">didn&#39;t expect but on the other hand hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.910" end="00:09:34.330" style="s2">you know Plato talks with Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.870" end="00:09:36.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense that a conversation can</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.330" end="00:09:39.730" style="s2">sometimes get you to a place that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.150" end="00:09:41.890" style="s2">transcendental wherein equivalent or</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.730" end="00:09:45.130" style="s2">even exceeds sometimes your own personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.890" end="00:09:49.540" style="s2">practice so both of those is what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.130" end="00:09:53.110" style="s2">either mmm yeah yeah and I would add a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.540" end="00:09:54.820" style="s2">third to and sometimes a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.110" end="00:09:56.380" style="s2">conversation completely destroys you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.820" end="00:09:58.810" style="s2">like it precipitates an existential</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.380" end="00:10:01.750" style="s2">crisis right and I think those that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.810" end="00:10:05.770" style="s2">that&#39;s one that I&#39;m longing to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.750" end="00:10:10.900" style="s2">better at personally but so if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.770" end="00:10:12.820" style="s2">consider those three well I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.900" end="00:10:14.050" style="s2">I mean this is an ongoing and open</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.820" end="00:10:16.120" style="s2">inquiry for me and a lot to a large</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.050" end="00:10:19.660" style="s2">degree it&#39;s why I started the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.120" end="00:10:21.820" style="s2">was to learn better how to have good</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.660" end="00:10:25.660" style="s2">conversations of least of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.820" end="00:10:33.840" style="s2">variety good intellectual conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.660" end="00:10:33.840" style="s2">I think the grounded and embodied I hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.060" end="00:10:41.790" style="s2">I&#39;ll say that for the purposes of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.830" end="00:10:49.070" style="s2">podcast I know but I&#39;m having a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.790" end="00:10:49.070" style="s2">conversation because my energy body is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.540" end="00:10:56.700" style="s2">progressively harmonized over the course</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.130" end="00:10:59.640" style="s2">of the dialogue we&#39;re bye-bye to the end</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.700" end="00:11:01.610" style="s2">I&#39;m basically a hair&#39;s breadth away from</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.640" end="00:11:04.140" style="s2">the state of Samadhi or concentration</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.610" end="00:11:06.330" style="s2">like I could sit down and everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.140" end="00:11:08.510" style="s2">would just be flowing and I think part</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.330" end="00:11:11.010" style="s2">of the reason that that happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.510" end="00:11:13.250" style="s2">and and part of what constitutes a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.010" end="00:11:16.470" style="s2">conversation is that I&#39;m constantly</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.250" end="00:11:18.990" style="s2">speaking on behalf of that which seems</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.470" end="00:11:22.590" style="s2">most meaningful and relevant to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.990" end="00:11:24.570" style="s2">discursive the dialogical space and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.590" end="00:11:28.050" style="s2">to the degree that you don&#39;t do that or</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.570" end="00:11:30.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t do that that seems to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.050" end="00:11:32.460" style="s2">ossify my energy and then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.840" end="00:11:35.130" style="s2">conversation doesn&#39;t feel as good and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.460" end="00:11:37.770" style="s2">whatever is meant to be said in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.130" end="00:11:39.510" style="s2">service it doesn&#39;t get fed and it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.770" end="00:11:41.210" style="s2">can kind of feel it in that field and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.510" end="00:11:43.800" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t feel good</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.210" end="00:11:46.670" style="s2">so you&#39;re navigating by feeling and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.800" end="00:11:49.020" style="s2">trying to serve the context and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.670" end="00:11:51.060" style="s2">remembering the the opening that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.020" end="00:11:53.100" style="s2">available for what this conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.060" end="00:11:56.280" style="s2">supposed to become like leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.100" end="00:11:57.660" style="s2">space for it totally yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.280" end="00:12:00.540" style="s2">the most important thing is that I I</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.660" end="00:12:02.850" style="s2">don&#39;t I do what I can to try not to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.540" end="00:12:04.140" style="s2">too much in my head which is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.850" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">I think because people listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.140" end="00:12:08.310" style="s2">podcast the conversations I have my</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:10.050" style="s2">podcast and they it seems very heady a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.310" end="00:12:11.610" style="s2">lot of people tell me they can&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.050" end="00:12:13.830" style="s2">to it because it&#39;s like too intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.610" end="00:12:15.570" style="s2">but the actual experience for me of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.830" end="00:12:20.310" style="s2">participating in the conversations is</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.570" end="00:12:22.770" style="s2">one of deep embodiment typically where</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.310" end="00:12:26.250" style="s2">I&#39;m actually just like feeling my way</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.770" end="00:12:28.260" style="s2">like I will feel like I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.250" end="00:12:30.510" style="s2">something and there oh what don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.260" end="00:12:32.700" style="s2">understand my body will tell against</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.510" end="00:12:34.290" style="s2">something and then the words will come</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.700" end="00:12:35.910" style="s2">into my head and then I&#39;ll speak them</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.290" end="00:12:37.260" style="s2">but it comes from the body it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.910" end="00:12:38.490" style="s2">come from like the head out of my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.260" end="00:12:40.040" style="s2">it comes like I think it comes from my</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.490" end="00:12:42.810" style="s2">body up into my head and out my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.040" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">and as soon as I make it like head to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.810" end="00:12:46.140" style="s2">mouth just head to mouth the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:49.410" style="s2">conversation gets real</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.140" end="00:12:51.870" style="s2">I feel and yeah boring and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.410" end="00:12:53.730" style="s2">interesting to me when when a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.870" end="00:12:56.400" style="s2">embodied conversation is perceived by</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.730" end="00:12:58.650" style="s2">someone else to be too heady and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.400" end="00:13:00.990" style="s2">often tells you more about the listener</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.650" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">about the speaker title they remember</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.990" end="00:13:03.960" style="s2">hearing a poet say that he became a poet</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">because he didn&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.960" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2">imagination to do mathematics you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:14.430" style="s2">going at ideas with heart and body then</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:15.780" style="s2">you can take heart and body up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.430" end="00:13:17.280" style="s2">an amazing idea around this but if</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.780" end="00:13:19.410" style="s2">someone else isn&#39;t doing that they just</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.280" end="00:13:22.710" style="s2">hear amazing idea realms and kind of gap</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.410" end="00:13:24.450" style="s2">out totally I know I know yeah I got</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.710" end="00:13:28.530" style="s2">like chills all over my body and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.450" end="00:13:33.000" style="s2">something that I am so alive with is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.530" end="00:13:36.660" style="s2">that ideas can be this erotic landscape</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.000" end="00:13:38.280" style="s2">of embodied experience but so many</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.660" end="00:13:41.580" style="s2">people especially in the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.280" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">circles of the modern West I think tend</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.580" end="00:13:48.180" style="s2">to just be like concepts are anti</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:49.950" style="s2">spiritual antibody and if you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.180" end="00:13:52.380" style="s2">in that kind of world then you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.950" end="00:13:54.210" style="s2">not practicing or that&#39;s that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.380" end="00:13:56.730" style="s2">this is all about that&#39;s problem you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.210" end="00:13:58.680" style="s2">know get away from concepts and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.730" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">been one of the kind of baselines of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.680" end="00:14:04.680" style="s2">podcast is basically trying to disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:07.080" style="s2">that I think really naive perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.680" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">concepts the problem is that typically</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.080" end="00:14:10.200" style="s2">the way you disrupt that astute concepts</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:13.260" style="s2">and the people that are really holding</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.200" end="00:14:16.200" style="s2">to that perspective I suspect really</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.260" end="00:14:18.780" style="s2">encounter you know these these very</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.200" end="00:14:21.240" style="s2">persuasive in my opinion and and well</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.780" end="00:14:23.280" style="s2">thought through lines of arguments but</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.240" end="00:14:26.100" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s to their own detriment because</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.280" end="00:14:29.790" style="s2">honestly like the landscape of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.100" end="00:14:34.200" style="s2">that conceptuality opens up is enormous</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.790" end="00:14:35.700" style="s2">I mean and it&#39;s such a such a tragedy I</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.200" end="00:14:39.990" style="s2">think that so many people in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.700" end="00:14:41.430" style="s2">spiritual world act you have a concept</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.990" end="00:14:44.340" style="s2">that tells them that concepts are not</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.430" end="00:14:48.870" style="s2">relevant to spirituality it&#39;s very sad</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.340" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">to me yeah self-sabotage at every level</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.870" end="00:14:55.710" style="s2">is possibly yeah you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:58.080" style="s2">wanting to get into conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.710" end="00:14:58.740" style="s2">precipitate a crisis and maybe destroy</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.080" end="00:14:59.970" style="s2">you hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.740" end="00:15:02.279" style="s2">now were you thinking more</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.970" end="00:15:04.230" style="s2">terms of your skill of destroying</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.279" end="00:15:08.910" style="s2">someone in a conversation or reopening</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.230" end="00:15:12.389" style="s2">together oh oh I would love to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.910" end="00:15:13.800" style="s2">destroyed I mean both you know I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.389" end="00:15:16.199" style="s2">think that&#39;s really what I had a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.800" end="00:15:17.610" style="s2">conversation with Andrew Taggert on my</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.199" end="00:15:19.439" style="s2">podcast one last conversations I</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.610" end="00:15:23.990" style="s2">recorded and we talked about this but</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.439" end="00:15:29.220" style="s2">essentially there&#39;s a way I think of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.990" end="00:15:30.930" style="s2">speaking to each other that doesn&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.220" end="00:15:32.699" style="s2">your conversational partner turn away</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.930" end="00:15:36.269" style="s2">from the truth and integrity of their</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.699" end="00:15:38.339" style="s2">heart and often if somebody like manages</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.269" end="00:15:40.290" style="s2">holds your holds your face in it for</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.339" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">long enough you&#39;ll you&#39;ll you&#39;ll you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.290" end="00:15:47.009" style="s2">often break open to new understandings</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:48.089" style="s2">of how your life how you typically how</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.009" end="00:15:51.569" style="s2">you&#39;ve been living out of integrity with</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.089" end="00:15:53.009" style="s2">what you know to be true and I I&#39;ll of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.569" end="00:15:54.600" style="s2">it when that happens I mean part of me</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.009" end="00:15:56.220" style="s2">hates it you know part of me does not</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.600" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">want to do that but I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.220" end="00:16:00.750" style="s2">appreciative in the from a longer longer</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:01.980" style="s2">term perspective when somebody does that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.750" end="00:16:04.139" style="s2">and I&#39;d like to get better at that</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.980" end="00:16:07.230" style="s2">myself with supporting people and not</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.139" end="00:16:11.250" style="s2">looking away from their integrity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.230" end="00:16:15.809" style="s2">it&#39;s a fine line because there are seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.250" end="00:16:18.139" style="s2">like a lot of people who their ego</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.809" end="00:16:20.250" style="s2">prides themselves on their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.139" end="00:16:24.389" style="s2">interfere with others for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.250" end="00:16:26.610" style="s2">what they think is the truth mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.389" end="00:16:31.410" style="s2">yeah right well that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.610" end="00:16:33.480" style="s2">makes it such a let&#39;s say artful process</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.410" end="00:16:37.949" style="s2">right because if you do that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.480" end="00:16:41.309" style="s2">that&#39;s just more there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.949" end="00:16:43.800" style="s2">thing obviously Zen history is full of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.309" end="00:16:49.620" style="s2">these fragments of conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.800" end="00:16:51.660" style="s2">were thought to have facilitated made</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.620" end="00:16:56.100" style="s2">non-duality visceral and contagious</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.660" end="00:16:57.990" style="s2">let&#39;s say what what have you noticed</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.100" end="00:17:00.750" style="s2">about conversations that you&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.990" end="00:17:02.759" style="s2">in your life we&#39;re in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.750" end="00:17:10.740" style="s2">you felt like some other transmission</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.759" end="00:17:12.360" style="s2">came across to you but one place where</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.740" end="00:17:14.970" style="s2">that happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.360" end="00:17:16.350" style="s2">quite often for me is here at the Manasa</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.970" end="00:17:18.030" style="s2">Academy in the interview room you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.350" end="00:17:20.189" style="s2">when I&#39;m working with the teacher here</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.030" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">so are you for all and he would be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.189" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">great person to have on some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:34.460" style="s2">podcast to ask that question to he comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:37.950" style="s2">from a Zen background and more generally</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.460" end="00:17:44.429" style="s2">it seems to be the case that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.950" end="00:17:49.620" style="s2">happens to the degree that both parties</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.429" end="00:17:52.410" style="s2">are holding this stance of being more or</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.620" end="00:17:57.720" style="s2">less unwilling to look away from what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.410" end="00:18:02.490" style="s2">true now true is a very difficult word</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.720" end="00:18:04.410" style="s2">to use with a straight face but to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.490" end="00:18:09.450" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.410" end="00:18:11.790" style="s2">both parties are really I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.450" end="00:18:13.710" style="s2">it better PI better to put them in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.790" end="00:18:17.130" style="s2">negative and unwilling to each</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.710" end="00:18:19.320" style="s2">other yeah and then something something</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.130" end="00:18:22.440" style="s2">can sometimes arise there is my</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.320" end="00:18:25.049" style="s2">experience but man if I could make it</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.440" end="00:18:27.179" style="s2">happen more often I would love to know</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.049" end="00:18:29.309" style="s2">exactly how that meat gets made what do</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.179" end="00:18:29.669" style="s2">you what do you think I know you got me</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.309" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.669" end="00:18:34.049" style="s2">yeah well I mean if I look at that Zen</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:36.270" style="s2">history there&#39;s obviously a peculiar</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.049" end="00:18:39.090" style="s2">style of phrasing that they&#39;re using the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.270" end="00:18:42.090" style="s2">people have to have the degree of being</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.090" end="00:18:44.070" style="s2">that enables that to have it but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.090" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">sure then about that we call it</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.070" end="00:18:49.530" style="s2">paradoxical or whatever but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:51.150" style="s2">something about putting putting focus on</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.530" end="00:18:54.330" style="s2">something where there&#39;s no room to move</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.150" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">and also suspecting all the answers</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.330" end="00:18:59.970" style="s2">might be in that trap and on so I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.840" end="00:19:02.700" style="s2">shifting context if you read all those</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.970" end="00:19:04.290" style="s2">Zen parable cases very often the next</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.700" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">person who speaks comes at it from a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.290" end="00:19:07.590" style="s2">completely different angle</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">then they get hit by another angles in</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.590" end="00:19:11.100" style="s2">this kind of radical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:16.020" style="s2">shifting I was gonna ask about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.100" end="00:19:18.360" style="s2">because I wonder about the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.020" end="00:19:21.929" style="s2">which moving among different types of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.360" end="00:19:23.850" style="s2">truths facilitates the Harmonized</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.929" end="00:19:25.470" style="s2">experience and the higher possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.850" end="00:19:27.780" style="s2">of discourse like it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.470" end="00:19:30.690" style="s2">person is bringing sensations and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.780" end="00:19:33.210" style="s2">feeling and ideas or moving back and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.690" end="00:19:35.400" style="s2">forth between spiritual and material or</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.210" end="00:19:39.450" style="s2">or whatever the domains are the moving</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.400" end="00:19:44.370" style="s2">among domain and facilitated yep I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.450" end="00:19:48.260" style="s2">so I think so I mean that is fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.370" end="00:19:51.270" style="s2">to my you know spirituality I suppose is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.260" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">really playing with different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.270" end="00:19:57.510" style="s2">looking or different ways of relating to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:20:00.630" style="s2">whatever it is right but understanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.510" end="00:20:03.380" style="s2">that the way of looking itself the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.630" end="00:20:07.799" style="s2">object whatever it is the idea the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.380" end="00:20:10.650" style="s2">situation arises dependently with how</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.799" end="00:20:12.780" style="s2">you look at it and so by kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.650" end="00:20:15.090" style="s2">shifting perspectives or shifting ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.780" end="00:20:16.890" style="s2">of looking shifting ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.090" end="00:20:19.770" style="s2">relating we actually give rise I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.890" end="00:20:23.010" style="s2">to a richer thing whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.770" end="00:20:25.140" style="s2">we&#39;re playing with right and so in terms</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.010" end="00:20:26.730" style="s2">of building a rich conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.140" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s indispensable if you&#39;re locked into</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.730" end="00:20:35.730" style="s2">one perspective I mean I hope it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:37.409" style="s2">good one yeah I don&#39;t have a question</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.730" end="00:20:38.820" style="s2">about this but I just wanted to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.409" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">up because it&#39;s something that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.820" end="00:20:43.830" style="s2">at the edge of my thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:46.230" style="s2">conversations which is a moment or a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.830" end="00:20:48.809" style="s2">degree to which that richness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.230" end="00:20:51.179" style="s2">been built up or discovered starts to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.809" end="00:20:53.370" style="s2">become a layer as if it was a third</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.179" end="00:20:55.770" style="s2">participant in the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.370" end="00:20:58.289" style="s2">whether I have a responsibility to sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.770" end="00:21:03.140" style="s2">of shift into a relationship to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.289" end="00:21:06.419" style="s2">once it&#39;s there mmm that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.140" end="00:21:10.500" style="s2">yeah I find it very useful teacher to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.419" end="00:21:11.940" style="s2">bring to presence that personally how do</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.500" end="00:21:14.490" style="s2">you how do you usually work with that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.940" end="00:21:16.200" style="s2">question or that tension well it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.490" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">don&#39;t I&#39;m not satisfied with the degree</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.200" end="00:21:20.789" style="s2">to which I work with it because usually</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">I it&#39;s clear to me in retrospect after</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.789" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">the conversation I think oh it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:27.480" style="s2">definitely never I&#39;m walk away with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">afterwards but I think what could I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.480" end="00:21:30.030" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:32.610" style="s2">in the speech other than be peripherally</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.030" end="00:21:34.289" style="s2">aware of it you know calling out mention</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.610" end="00:21:38.850" style="s2">it is that enough what would the next</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.289" end="00:21:41.130" style="s2">step be yeah my sense is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.850" end="00:21:46.550" style="s2">really powerful move if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.130" end="00:21:49.860" style="s2">attempting to kind of create this third</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.550" end="00:21:51.810" style="s2">almost like biological entity amongst</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.860" end="00:21:54.600" style="s2">the participants because what I notice</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.810" end="00:21:56.760" style="s2">is that if I&#39;m feeling it if I&#39;m sensing</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.600" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">it and then I name it the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.760" end="00:22:01.140" style="s2">participant can also then name it sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">it and we can actually develop some more</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.140" end="00:22:07.230" style="s2">coherence around the naming of it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:09.390" style="s2">that if if we&#39;re all Co sensing it then</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.230" end="00:22:16.410" style="s2">that is typically what takes the whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.390" end="00:22:19.890" style="s2">thing to another octave usually away</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.410" end="00:22:22.850" style="s2">from a little bit it dampens though our</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.890" end="00:22:25.770" style="s2">my experience it dampens our individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.850" end="00:22:28.640" style="s2">like agency perspective a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.770" end="00:22:31.500" style="s2">though it tends to start amplifying this</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.640" end="00:22:33.420" style="s2">it tends towards more like unity</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.500" end="00:22:37.080" style="s2">consciousness and things like that which</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.420" end="00:22:39.690" style="s2">is great you know you have choices to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.080" end="00:22:42.510" style="s2">make I suppose yeah I&#39;m always concerned</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.690" end="00:22:46.590" style="s2">about the what the relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.510" end="00:22:48.560" style="s2">between the structural capacity of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.590" end="00:22:51.930" style="s2">relationship or a group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.560" end="00:22:53.790" style="s2">versus their ability to get into higher</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.930" end="00:22:55.530" style="s2">mutual harmonies with each other because</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.790" end="00:22:57.810" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen a lot of groups get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.530" end="00:23:00.570" style="s2">that is amazing in their interest</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.810" end="00:23:02.250" style="s2">subjective communion but then I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.570" end="00:23:05.130" style="s2">it not necessarily become anything in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.250" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">any of their lives and I know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.130" end="00:23:09.300" style="s2">lot of groups that can function together</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.260" end="00:23:10.890" style="s2">in very intelligent ways that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.300" end="00:23:14.850" style="s2">necessarily get that experience with</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.890" end="00:23:17.580" style="s2">each other hmm yeah what do you make up</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.850" end="00:23:19.500" style="s2">that discrepancy I mean I I sort of have</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.580" end="00:23:21.420" style="s2">to just imagine they&#39;re two different</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.500" end="00:23:24.270" style="s2">epistemological domains with their own</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.420" end="00:23:25.920" style="s2">sets of practices and procedures but in</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.270" end="00:23:28.830" style="s2">my heart I feel like there&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.920" end="00:23:31.890" style="s2">interface and I feel like it&#39;ll be a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.830" end="00:23:34.950" style="s2">of of holding and questioning the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.890" end="00:23:36.750" style="s2">emergent mutual field in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.950" end="00:23:40.050" style="s2">it would be predisposed to become</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.750" end="00:23:41.400" style="s2">structured and embodied more so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.050" end="00:23:44.730" style="s2">saying that there&#39;s some way of holding</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.400" end="00:23:48.360" style="s2">those kind of like peak experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.730" end="00:23:50.940" style="s2">would help it to embody into the life</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.360" end="00:23:52.380" style="s2">beyond that peak experience is that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.940" end="00:23:57.180" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.380" end="00:24:00.600" style="s2">like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.180" end="00:24:02.070" style="s2">well you know speaking it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.600" end="00:24:03.660" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of running an experiment here</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.070" end="00:24:06.030" style="s2">where I live at the monastic Academy</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.660" end="00:24:07.320" style="s2">because we do circling retreats and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.030" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">circling practice are you familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.320" end="00:24:13.500" style="s2">circling is it yeah yeah so it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:16.560" style="s2">of inner subjective conversational</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.500" end="00:24:19.230" style="s2">meditation style and you know we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.560" end="00:24:23.850" style="s2">do week-long retreats where all we do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.230" end="00:24:26.160" style="s2">circle together and we definitely reach</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.850" end="00:24:29.430" style="s2">states of kind of collective coherence</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.160" end="00:24:32.100" style="s2">that are peak experiences and outside</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.430" end="00:24:33.720" style="s2">the norm of what we experienced in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.100" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">week-to-week day-to-day but then we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.720" end="00:24:37.410" style="s2">immediately go back into our work life</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:40.440" style="s2">our practice life together here at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.410" end="00:24:47.700" style="s2">center and what I notice is that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.440" end="00:24:50.130" style="s2">definitely impacts the the kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.700" end="00:24:52.920" style="s2">the kind of like psychic social</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.130" end="00:24:56.100" style="s2">infrastructure of trust and love and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.920" end="00:24:57.540" style="s2">patience and willingness to do things</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.100" end="00:24:59.220" style="s2">that you don&#39;t want to do for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.540" end="00:25:00.870" style="s2">of the whole and all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.220" end="00:25:04.230" style="s2">make a community like this actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.870" end="00:25:06.780" style="s2">flourish and I wonder the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.230" end="00:25:08.820" style="s2">which the but you what you notice about</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.780" end="00:25:12.660" style="s2">how these peak experiences don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.820" end="00:25:14.940" style="s2">necessarily then land in the world so to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.660" end="00:25:17.340" style="s2">speak is due to the fact that so many</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.940" end="00:25:19.170" style="s2">people do that kind of work in drop-in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.340" end="00:25:20.490" style="s2">groups right where they&#39;re just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.170" end="00:25:22.200" style="s2">encountering each other for a brief</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.490" end="00:25:24.990" style="s2">period of time for a weekend or a week</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.200" end="00:25:27.030" style="s2">and then they kind of my experiences you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.990" end="00:25:29.400" style="s2">then try to like make it work using</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.030" end="00:25:33.720" style="s2">online communications or maybe you even</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.400" end="00:25:35.880" style="s2">do like a semi-regular group if you all</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.720" end="00:25:38.460" style="s2">live in the same place but that is not</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:40.500" style="s2">the same as living together in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.460" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">community where you&#39;re you know just</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.500" end="00:25:48.600" style="s2">have to make it work because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:51.530" style="s2">escape and so I I haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.600" end="00:25:53.780" style="s2">noticed as much of a discrepancy here</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.530" end="00:25:55.980" style="s2">the the one that you referred to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.780" end="00:25:57.480" style="s2">probably though because of the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.980" end="00:26:00.500" style="s2">of you know the structure and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.480" end="00:26:03.090" style="s2">schedule and fact we all live together</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.500" end="00:26:05.610" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s interesting that could</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.090" end="00:26:06.119" style="s2">be make a big difference I think to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.610" end="00:26:09.049" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.119" end="00:26:11.729" style="s2">a bit of an analogy to the question of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.049" end="00:26:15.439" style="s2">personal experiences and assimilation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.729" end="00:26:18.389" style="s2">those experiences I live in a horror of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.439" end="00:26:21.899" style="s2">getting at the end of my life and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.389" end="00:26:23.759" style="s2">the peaks all the insights they all just</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.899" end="00:26:27.209" style="s2">were for a moment and fell away I never</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.759" end="00:26:29.519" style="s2">kept any now pardon likes the surrender</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.209" end="00:26:31.199" style="s2">and gliese but another part of me thinks</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.519" end="00:26:34.199" style="s2">yeah my job is not to get into</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.199" end="00:26:40.679" style="s2">epiphanies my job isn&#39;t something back</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.199" end="00:26:43.199" style="s2">from epiphanies mm-hmm yeah poof yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.679" end="00:26:46.079" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s real tough yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.199" end="00:26:48.839" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s as the teacher here at</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.079" end="00:26:51.749" style="s2">Maple Banasik Academy says that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.839" end="00:26:56.699" style="s2">the rub of the spiritual path to a large</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.749" end="00:27:00.149" style="s2">degree is letting letting go of your</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.699" end="00:27:03.989" style="s2">insights without forgetting them yes you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.149" end="00:27:07.799" style="s2">and I struggle with that pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.989" end="00:27:09.719" style="s2">every day I&#39;m not very good at yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.799" end="00:27:11.699" style="s2">like breathing I mean something comes in</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.719" end="00:27:13.649" style="s2">and then you let it go back out but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.699" end="00:27:17.369" style="s2">hope you got something in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.649" end="00:27:21.059" style="s2">what you released yeah but it&#39;s so easy</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.369" end="00:27:23.129" style="s2">to have an insight and and then it just</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.059" end="00:27:25.199" style="s2">completely evaporates and doesn&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.129" end="00:27:28.379" style="s2">a mark on your life yeah I&#39;ve had it</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.199" end="00:27:29.909" style="s2">happen to myself many many times and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.379" end="00:27:34.079" style="s2">then I almost have to have that insight</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.909" end="00:27:35.909" style="s2">again and I was and and I know lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.079" end="00:27:38.219" style="s2">people I mean lots of people who come</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.909" end="00:27:40.349" style="s2">here have insights and then just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.219" end="00:27:42.329" style="s2">like nothing happened but something did</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.349" end="00:27:45.059" style="s2">happen but nothing happened really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.329" end="00:27:46.439" style="s2">a there&#39;s a beautiful tragic moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.059" end="00:27:47.849" style="s2">where you have an epiphany and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.439" end="00:27:54.569" style="s2">like oh and you realize you&#39;ve had that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.849" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">epiphany before and so what yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.569" end="00:27:58.289" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I mean though with</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:28:01.199" style="s2">the good conversations and I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.289" end="00:28:03.089" style="s2">to me why the a form of good</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.199" end="00:28:05.909" style="s2">conversation is the kind of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.089" end="00:28:09.689" style="s2">where we hold each other accountable to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.909" end="00:28:12.059" style="s2">our realizations right that like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.689" end="00:28:15.259" style="s2">you a part of the way that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.059" end="00:28:17.579" style="s2">forget our insights is is through</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.259" end="00:28:19.890" style="s2">accountability and through community and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.579" end="00:28:23.700" style="s2">through naming it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.890" end="00:28:28.410" style="s2">people that we want the respect of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.700" end="00:28:30.270" style="s2">know things like that and so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.410" end="00:28:32.900" style="s2">a big part of where I think like my</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.270" end="00:28:36.810" style="s2">solitaire practice kind of grounds into</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.900" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">my life in community the social aspect</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.810" end="00:28:44.070" style="s2">is is definitely one of the features</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:46.770" style="s2">that helps the anchoring process what</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.070" end="00:28:49.020" style="s2">about what about your family do you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.770" end="00:28:53.000" style="s2">good family conversations what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.020" end="00:28:53.000" style="s2">childhood background in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.050" end="00:29:01.710" style="s2">well I&#39;ll state you know my family</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.210" end="00:29:04.590" style="s2">nobody and my feelings interested in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.710" end="00:29:07.080" style="s2">these topics it&#39;s like I had my mom</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.590" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">who&#39;s like an incredibly intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.080" end="00:29:10.410" style="s2">woman you know professor</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:13.130" style="s2">well everybody my family is a professor</p>

<p begin="00:29:13.130" end="00:29:17.730" style="s2">I had my mom she listened to one of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.930" end="00:29:19.770" style="s2">podcast episodes and it just did not get</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.730" end="00:29:21.900" style="s2">anything she was like that this all</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.770" end="00:29:23.580" style="s2">sounds like nonsense to me basically but</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.900" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">I&#39;m happy that you&#39;re that you enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.580" end="00:29:28.710" style="s2">these conversations and so the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:32.370" style="s2">of content wise there&#39;s not much of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.710" end="00:29:37.670" style="s2">there&#39;s not much symmetry of interest I</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.370" end="00:29:39.960" style="s2">guess you could say but you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.670" end="00:29:42.420" style="s2">certainly I grew up given that my</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.960" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">parents were both perfect they would</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.420" end="00:29:47.060" style="s2">often talk about ideas at the dinner</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:53.190" style="s2">table and so there was this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.060" end="00:29:55.340" style="s2">just love of concepts I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.190" end="00:29:59.310" style="s2">implanted in me is from a very young age</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.340" end="00:30:01.830" style="s2">that I&#39;ve struggled with because like</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.310" end="00:30:03.570" style="s2">spiritual people quote-unquote aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.830" end="00:30:07.460" style="s2">all wrong like obviously concepts are a</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.570" end="00:30:10.950" style="s2">problem if they&#39;re held incorrectly but</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.460" end="00:30:11.700" style="s2">but I also you know it&#39;s that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.950" end="00:30:13.710" style="s2">let throw the baby out with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.700" end="00:30:15.000" style="s2">bathwater and so that was definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.710" end="00:30:17.460" style="s2">big part of my childhood and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.000" end="00:30:19.290" style="s2">probably a large degree to why I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.460" end="00:30:23.580" style="s2">kind of swim in these multi-perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.290" end="00:30:27.920" style="s2">waters the way I can spiritual people</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.580" end="00:30:27.920" style="s2">are all wrong says Daniel Thorson</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.470" end="00:30:37.900" style="s2">when you say like that oh geez I&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.610" end="00:30:50.470" style="s2">one of those things at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.900" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">screen where it quotes you in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">like who do you admire who do you</p>

<p begin="00:31:00.909" end="00:31:05.980" style="s2">who do you listen to yeah I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.940" end="00:31:09.909" style="s2">terms of like professionalism obviously</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">it seems like Peter Lindbergh with what</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:45.070" style="s2">pushed the whole field forward is the</p>

<p begin="00:31:51.970" end="00:31:59.380" style="s2">money as far as I&#39;m concerned I do</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.760" end="00:32:02.370" style="s2">though think that in general oh how can</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.380" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">I say this in a way that&#39;s not annoying</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.370" end="00:32:09.220" style="s2">I wish I wish people in our in our in</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:13.809" style="s2">our neck of the woods were a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.220" end="00:32:17.650" style="s2">more earnest in our media ecology you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.809" end="00:32:19.210" style="s2">know I find today my earnest I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.650" end="00:32:24.730" style="s2">like to wear my heart on my sleeve like</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.210" end="00:32:27.870" style="s2">this is this is all about being of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.730" end="00:32:31.830" style="s2">service to the world to sentient beings</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.870" end="00:32:37.419" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s Buddhist parlance but like</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.830" end="00:32:38.289" style="s2">coming out of retreat I feel like why</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.419" end="00:32:41.679" style="s2">are we having some of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.289" end="00:32:45.100" style="s2">conversations I think for me if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:47.080" style="s2">about either be</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.100" end="00:32:50.950" style="s2">coming more able to be of service or of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.080" end="00:32:58.240" style="s2">directly serving the world then what</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.950" end="00:33:00.250" style="s2">what is this and maybe this is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.240" end="00:33:02.020" style="s2">saying you know in meta modern terms</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.250" end="00:33:05.860" style="s2">there&#39;s the irony and sincerity kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.020" end="00:33:08.010" style="s2">like oscillation I wonder if we&#39;re if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.860" end="00:33:11.549" style="s2">haven&#39;t yet found our way to a real</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.010" end="00:33:14.860" style="s2">grounded sincerity that we can trust and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.549" end="00:33:17.950" style="s2">I wonder where that will come from and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.860" end="00:33:19.929" style="s2">how we can rely on that and take that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.950" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">seriously and be willing to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.929" end="00:33:26.280" style="s2">have these conversations with our heart</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.000" end="00:33:29.710" style="s2">open maybe and yeah something like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.280" end="00:33:32.740" style="s2">yeah I do think this sincerity side lags</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.710" end="00:33:36.130" style="s2">little on the sister irony I part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.740" end="00:33:39.880" style="s2">that is probably because just the long</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.130" end="00:33:42.280" style="s2">history of pre-modern especially but</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.880" end="00:33:45.730" style="s2">pre-modern and modern forms of sincerity</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.280" end="00:33:49.000" style="s2">so like it&#39;s hard to be ironic in terms</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.730" end="00:33:50.740" style="s2">of flexible and meta and you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.000" end="00:33:52.990" style="s2">you can post metaphysical things like</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.740" end="00:33:54.400" style="s2">that to do that and really feel like</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.990" end="00:33:55.900" style="s2">you&#39;re taking things seriously when</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.400" end="00:33:58.330" style="s2">everybody whoever took anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.900" end="00:34:02.409" style="s2">seriously was doing it with these huge</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.330" end="00:34:04.120" style="s2">totalizing assertions yeah well so</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.409" end="00:34:06.669" style="s2">what&#39;s your what&#39;s your take on how you</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.120" end="00:34:08.770" style="s2">discover a kind of I love that term post</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.669" end="00:34:12.129" style="s2">metaphysical sincerity like what&#39;swhat&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.770" end="00:34:14.470" style="s2">all wrapped up in that I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.129" end="00:34:15.879" style="s2">probably two things and one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.470" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">just the emotional component is if</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.879" end="00:34:19.300" style="s2">you&#39;re better with your emotions or if</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:22.210" style="s2">you skew conversations like I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.300" end="00:34:24.669" style="s2">asking people what they hope is a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.210" end="00:34:26.909" style="s2">way to getting their earnestness but</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.669" end="00:34:29.619" style="s2">another part of it is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.909" end="00:34:31.750" style="s2">foreground background flip where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.619" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">tended to think there&#39;s viewpoints and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.750" end="00:34:36.040" style="s2">then there&#39;s some kind of space between</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:37.780" style="s2">the viewpoints that maybe we tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.040" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">maybe we don&#39;t but if we thought of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.780" end="00:34:42.190" style="s2">space between the viewpoints if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:45.730" style="s2">thought of the inter perspectival space</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.190" end="00:34:49.330" style="s2">as the real solid grounds not the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.730" end="00:34:51.010" style="s2">mysterious airy in between that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.330" end="00:34:53.320" style="s2">we all know it&#39;s solid we can have</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.010" end="00:34:56.169" style="s2">confidence in that we can go forward and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.320" end="00:34:58.450" style="s2">then we can tell each other that we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.169" end="00:35:01.540" style="s2">have all the profundity of the past</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.450" end="00:35:06.310" style="s2">maybe more from that space of not having</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.540" end="00:35:08.109" style="s2">to believe in insist yeah yeah that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.310" end="00:35:13.900" style="s2">resonates yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.109" end="00:35:15.910" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s some kind of like that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.900" end="00:35:17.890" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s the trick is there</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.910" end="00:35:20.920" style="s2">some kind of sincerity in emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.890" end="00:35:22.750" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of sincerity in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.920" end="00:35:27.579" style="s2">theater like nature of the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.750" end="00:35:28.810" style="s2">that I hope we all can turn into because</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.579" end="00:35:30.730" style="s2">I think it&#39;s actually really an</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.810" end="00:35:37.960" style="s2">important part of these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.730" end="00:35:40.990" style="s2">having a potency yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.960" end="00:35:43.839" style="s2">hugely important to me but I&#39;m seldom in</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.990" end="00:35:45.030" style="s2">discussions where it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.839" end="00:35:48.700" style="s2">bring it forward</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.030" end="00:35:51.220" style="s2">I&#39;m very often it&#39;s such a arcane or</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.700" end="00:35:53.470" style="s2">contentious topic that you get derailed</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.220" end="00:35:56.140" style="s2">into weird considerations which aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.470" end="00:35:58.150" style="s2">that&#39;s not a bad thing to do but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.140" end="00:36:00.310" style="s2">it&#39;s only seems like it&#39;s a space where</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.150" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">somebody who already basically gets it</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.310" end="00:36:03.430" style="s2">can talk to somebody else who already</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:05.980" style="s2">basically gets it and that&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.430" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">go yet we&#39;re both right here this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.980" end="00:36:12.069" style="s2">this is really something we can work</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">with this it spread nonsense I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.069" end="00:36:14.950" style="s2">sure I&#39;m not sure I understand like</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:17.859" style="s2">where how does it derail typically or</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.950" end="00:36:21.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the here&#39;s the thing I was uh I</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.859" end="00:36:24.130" style="s2">was the guest on a philosophy salon a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.280" end="00:36:25.569" style="s2">few days ago I wanted me to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.130" end="00:36:27.130" style="s2">post metaphysical spirituality I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.569" end="00:36:28.690" style="s2">actually wanted to get into my theory of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.130" end="00:36:33.960" style="s2">the dynamics of spirituality but we</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.690" end="00:36:37.180" style="s2">never got there because the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.960" end="00:36:40.450" style="s2">spiritual experience and practice versus</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.180" end="00:36:42.220" style="s2">belief was such an interesting concept</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.450" end="00:36:43.720" style="s2">that everybody wanted to weigh in and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.220" end="00:36:44.470" style="s2">wonder about it and they hadn&#39;t heard it</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.720" end="00:36:47.829" style="s2">that way before</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.470" end="00:36:50.230" style="s2">some people had it as aggressively like</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.829" end="00:36:52.599" style="s2">how can you say that the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.230" end="00:36:56.829" style="s2">spiritual traditions is that belief is</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.599" end="00:36:58.660" style="s2">what works there&#39;s just a lot of issues</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.829" end="00:37:01.810" style="s2">for people and also it&#39;s a very new</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.660" end="00:37:04.390" style="s2">concept for a lot of people yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.810" end="00:37:08.680" style="s2">yeah railing but there&#39;s a lot of prep</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.390" end="00:37:11.980" style="s2">work yeah yeah well that&#39;s I mean oh boy</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.680" end="00:37:15.010" style="s2">so within one of the approach</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.980" end="00:37:18.730" style="s2">spiritual practice that I do is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.010" end="00:37:20.859" style="s2">a emerging spiritual approach called the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.730" end="00:37:24.340" style="s2">soul making Dharma created by Rob rupiah</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.859" end="00:37:26.200" style="s2">they talk about they call it feminist or</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.340" end="00:37:27.850" style="s2">Temenos which is a kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.200" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">container where you can actually have</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.850" end="00:37:32.920" style="s2">these deep experiences of sincerity and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:35.080" style="s2">beauty and divinity and sacredness with</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.920" end="00:37:36.910" style="s2">other participants but in order to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.080" end="00:37:40.119" style="s2">create that container you actually need</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.910" end="00:37:42.430" style="s2">a whole list of prerequisites everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.119" end="00:37:44.830" style="s2">from emotional sensitivity and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.430" end="00:37:48.130" style="s2">capacity and energy body sensitivity all</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.830" end="00:37:50.250" style="s2">the way to act to ontological symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.130" end="00:37:54.280" style="s2">right you need actual epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.250" end="00:37:55.930" style="s2">coherence in order to have these</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.280" end="00:37:59.800" style="s2">experiences and have them be held in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.930" end="00:38:02.950" style="s2">way that allows them to flourish and not</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.800" end="00:38:06.010" style="s2">be taken advantage of or derailed as you</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.950" end="00:38:11.410" style="s2">say and so I hear you there&#39;s like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.010" end="00:38:14.109" style="s2">that goes in to having the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.410" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">experiences that I longed for and that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.109" end="00:38:18.760" style="s2">hope that we can somehow they can</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:22.660" style="s2">somehow find their way into into media</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.760" end="00:38:27.420" style="s2">then for me I&#39;m interested in yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.660" end="00:38:30.010" style="s2">sense of energy sensitivity of a somatic</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.420" end="00:38:32.109" style="s2">generalized somatic interoception or</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.010" end="00:38:33.100" style="s2">whatever we might want to call it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.109" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">that&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.100" end="00:38:38.200" style="s2">to me that&#39;s you know a very route</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:41.320" style="s2">practice for establishing a container</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.200" end="00:38:42.730" style="s2">that works and takes me forward Lee now</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.320" end="00:38:44.440" style="s2">I get a whole series of interviews with</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.730" end="00:38:46.750" style="s2">people on spiritual transmission and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.440" end="00:38:49.960" style="s2">most of them sort of ignored my</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.750" end="00:38:51.880" style="s2">questions about that and felt like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.960" end="00:38:53.650" style="s2">know the higher consciousness is given</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.880" end="00:38:55.960" style="s2">by grace and it doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.650" end="00:38:57.490" style="s2">specific requirements and some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.960" end="00:39:00.220" style="s2">have that somatic sensing and some</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.490" end="00:39:02.980" style="s2">people don&#39;t and I&#39;m like okay look I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.220" end="00:39:06.040" style="s2">gonna ponder that but in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.980" end="00:39:07.900" style="s2">you don&#39;t get very far or or if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.040" end="00:39:10.260" style="s2">don&#39;t have that and you go forward you</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.900" end="00:39:13.810" style="s2">go forward with only part of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.260" end="00:39:15.250" style="s2">yeah yeah 100% agree with you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.810" end="00:39:17.619" style="s2">know if you noticed my slight kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.250" end="00:39:21.850" style="s2">like I felt taken aback that people</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.619" end="00:39:23.530" style="s2">would but you can I mean that&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.850" end="00:39:25.720" style="s2">not inconsistent with my experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.530" end="00:39:28.180" style="s2">all about this energy</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.720" end="00:39:32.200" style="s2">body this body of energy whose body or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.180" end="00:39:34.390" style="s2">soma soma is where this all goes down</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.200" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">I mean but then again you know varieties</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.390" end="00:39:38.609" style="s2">of human experience who knows maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:45.670" style="s2">there&#39;s other ways to go about it but I</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.609" end="00:39:47.140" style="s2">don&#39;t think so that I mean hang my hat</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.670" end="00:39:48.310" style="s2">somewhere I feel that so yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.140" end="00:39:53.020" style="s2">pretty that&#39;s a pretty defensible place</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.310" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">to hang it what about politics what do</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.020" end="00:39:59.080" style="s2">you think are the social analogies to</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.070" end="00:41:54.050" style="s2">much more personally sympathetic today I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.530" end="00:41:58.130" style="s2">think the liberal argument that you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.050" end="00:42:00.200" style="s2">stated I would say for my piece to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.130" end="00:42:03.170" style="s2">something that perhaps isn&#39;t as commonly</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.200" end="00:42:07.210" style="s2">said in these kinds of arenas is that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.170" end="00:42:10.040" style="s2">think one of the things that is hmm</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.210" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">might help this along is if we start</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.040" end="00:42:16.430" style="s2">revivifying concepts like the soul and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:21.020" style="s2">like God and the sacred and finding ways</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.430" end="00:42:25.940" style="s2">to hold them in this irony ironic</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.020" end="00:42:29.690" style="s2">sincerity such that they can have power</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.940" end="00:42:34.010" style="s2">again so that nature can be sacred and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.690" end="00:42:36.260" style="s2">so that life can be sacred so the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.010" end="00:42:43.670" style="s2">can be sacred you know and and that as</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.260" end="00:42:47.330" style="s2">we empower those and kind of find our</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.670" end="00:42:50.410" style="s2">desire to live in a way that creates a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.330" end="00:42:53.210" style="s2">beautiful soul then I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.410" end="00:42:55.130" style="s2">social systems will start to it will</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.210" end="00:42:58.700" style="s2">start to become clearer which social</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.130" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">systems in social context are anathema</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.700" end="00:43:03.800" style="s2">to this whole like if you if you walk</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:06.230" style="s2">into a modern hospital with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.800" end="00:43:09.260" style="s2">perspective of what amplifies and what</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.230" end="00:43:12.200" style="s2">dampens this it&#39;s a terrible place to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.260" end="00:43:14.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a terrible place to be even though</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.200" end="00:43:17.030" style="s2">death is right there next to this all</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.420" end="00:43:19.730" style="s2">it&#39;s very confusing and you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.030" end="00:43:22.970" style="s2">imagine reconstituting or just even</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.730" end="00:43:24.500" style="s2">making all kinds of shapes to a hospital</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.970" end="00:43:26.390" style="s2">to make it a little bit more soulful and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.500" end="00:43:29.060" style="s2">for me that that would feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.390" end="00:43:31.070" style="s2">know it&#39;s just an interesting way into</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.060" end="00:43:33.250" style="s2">thinking about what you what you brought</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.070" end="00:43:33.250" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.910" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">they just make me think of the last time</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.050" end="00:43:47.950" style="s2">I was in a hospital which was my father</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:51.080" style="s2">was in a coma</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.950" end="00:43:52.610" style="s2">around Christmas he&#39;s he&#39;s with my</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.080" end="00:43:55.880" style="s2">brother in Indonesia now so his</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.610" end="00:43:58.730" style="s2">recoveries been terrific but he was dead</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.880" end="00:44:00.710" style="s2">ish but it&#39;s interesting to be in those</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.730" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">hospital room spaces and to see what</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.710" end="00:44:06.230" style="s2">your actual options are for creating a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:12.620" style="s2">change in mood and bit of the case in</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.230" end="00:44:14.360" style="s2">there yeah not much knowledge a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.620" end="00:44:16.250" style="s2">bit I mean most people do nothing so you</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.360" end="00:44:18.770" style="s2">have you can bring in color you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.250" end="00:44:21.110" style="s2">bring in sound you can bring in love but</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.770" end="00:44:25.430" style="s2">the structure itself places a lot of any</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.110" end="00:44:28.360" style="s2">conditions on that yeah yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.430" end="00:44:31.220" style="s2">just making making making room for soul</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.360" end="00:44:34.250" style="s2">both in our own minds and hearts but</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.220" end="00:44:37.250" style="s2">also like in conversation and in systems</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.250" end="00:44:38.690" style="s2">when we can I think that&#39;s a big part or</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.250" end="00:44:40.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a big part for me it&#39;s a big part</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.690" end="00:44:42.770" style="s2">of where my I think passion is moving</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.220" end="00:44:45.590" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s a tricky one because</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.770" end="00:44:49.730" style="s2">there may be other dynamics in other</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.590" end="00:44:51.800" style="s2">zones you know if I it&#39;s a big part for</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.730" end="00:44:54.500" style="s2">me too but it sometimes I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.800" end="00:44:56.600" style="s2">that&#39;s just my specialization you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.500" end="00:44:59.060" style="s2">and what would be how would you rewrite</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.600" end="00:45:02.600" style="s2">the rules of a legislature to make its</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.060" end="00:45:04.730" style="s2">outputs more soulful regardless of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.600" end="00:45:09.500" style="s2">people who were involved I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.730" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">yeah totally uh and and I would not at</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.500" end="00:45:14.390" style="s2">all suggest that this is like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:17.000" style="s2">totalizing narrative right it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.390" end="00:45:19.550" style="s2">not all about soul but for me I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.000" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a leverage point that I&#39;m I&#39;m keen</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.550" end="00:45:22.930" style="s2">to get more familiar with because I</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.960" end="00:45:25.100" style="s2">partly because I grew up as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.930" end="00:45:27.110" style="s2">non-religious and spend a lot of time as</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.100" end="00:45:29.300" style="s2">an atheist and so even the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.110" end="00:45:34.900" style="s2">looking in this way is quite new to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.300" end="00:45:37.310" style="s2">and is is very rich and opening a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.900" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">beauty and meaningfulness in my life and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.310" end="00:45:40.420" style="s2">so I think I&#39;m most it&#39;s mostly a</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:46.280" style="s2">reflection of where I&#39;m not personally</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.420" end="00:45:47.540" style="s2">not that it&#39;s a panacea a means the you</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.280" end="00:45:49.190" style="s2">know spiritual religious life is</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.540" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">interesting to me I&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.190" end="00:45:55.100" style="s2">skeptical and upset</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:57.290" style="s2">with it and at this point I&#39;m I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.100" end="00:45:59.050" style="s2">of agnostic about whether anything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.290" end="00:46:01.610" style="s2">really there I actually don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.050" end="00:46:04.580" style="s2">whether there&#39;s any prior realities that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.610" end="00:46:06.230" style="s2">I&#39;m dealing with it would work on it but</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.580" end="00:46:09.290" style="s2">it also works fine if there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.230" end="00:46:12.260" style="s2">because there&#39;s a very easy model in</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.290" end="00:46:15.050" style="s2">which the integration of different parts</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.260" end="00:46:17.180" style="s2">of myself builds up into a surplus</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.050" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">resonance that I can then relate to in</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.180" end="00:46:22.420" style="s2">some fashion as a higher sample higher</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:24.920" style="s2">other a higher energy or whatever and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.420" end="00:46:27.500" style="s2">integrating me it produces a wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.920" end="00:46:29.450" style="s2">that is equivalent of my soul and I can</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.500" end="00:46:31.370" style="s2">also see there&#39;s a subtle analogy where</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.450" end="00:46:33.320" style="s2">if people come together and different</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.370" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">genres of culture come together they get</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.320" end="00:46:37.340" style="s2">a similar effect and they call it</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">religion they they divinized something</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.340" end="00:46:41.120" style="s2">about their culture right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">that we&#39;re absolutely fine with no</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.120" end="00:46:45.950" style="s2">pre-existing ontological necessities now</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:48.050" style="s2">they may or may not be there that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.950" end="00:46:49.970" style="s2">different discussion right it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.050" end="00:46:52.550" style="s2">have to be a god we need to experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.970" end="00:46:55.750" style="s2">God but I&#39;ve experienced God and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.550" end="00:46:55.750" style="s2">looked like he was really there</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.750" end="00:47:00.590" style="s2">yeah well also looks like these these</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.090" end="00:47:02.210" style="s2">trees outside my window are really there</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.590" end="00:47:04.550" style="s2">but they&#39;re not they&#39;re empty and any</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.210" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">god that exists is empty too is so yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.550" end="00:47:10.850" style="s2">also no I am NOT I guess see this is why</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:13.940" style="s2">you create containers in which there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.850" end="00:47:15.740" style="s2">ontological clarity when I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.940" end="00:47:18.830" style="s2">soul when I use that word I do not mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.740" end="00:47:20.270" style="s2">a self existing entity but there&#39;s none</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.830" end="00:47:25.370" style="s2">of that to be found as far as I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.270" end="00:47:28.130" style="s2">anywhere but we can still just like all</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.370" end="00:47:30.890" style="s2">these other non self existing entities</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.130" end="00:47:34.220" style="s2">that impact us Phoebe we can still play</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.890" end="00:47:37.010" style="s2">with the ideas hold them in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.220" end="00:47:38.660" style="s2">impact us deeply and open up landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.010" end="00:47:41.420" style="s2">of meaningfulness and beauty and soul</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.660" end="00:47:43.250" style="s2">even though that isn&#39;t a thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.420" end="00:47:44.990" style="s2">apparently there doesn&#39;t seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.250" end="00:47:47.240" style="s2">thing baby</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.990" end="00:47:48.980" style="s2">you know agnostic about whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.240" end="00:47:52.310" style="s2">the thing it was very at least yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.980" end="00:47:54.740" style="s2">agnosticism real nor not real well they</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.310" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">say in Buddhism this is they say they</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.740" end="00:47:59.810" style="s2">say the middle path is it&#39;s neither real</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:02.750" style="s2">nor not real that&#39;s the razor&#39;s edge and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.810" end="00:48:04.369" style="s2">I mean that is a that opens up into a</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.750" end="00:48:06.349" style="s2">very broad highway</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.369" end="00:48:08.930" style="s2">experimentation in clay I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.349" end="00:48:12.259" style="s2">if you walk it carefully so that got a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.930" end="00:48:16.219" style="s2">middle path approach you know Anna</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.259" end="00:48:18.440" style="s2">Garden is turning of the wheel yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.219" end="00:48:20.930" style="s2">really profound it&#39;s the grandfather of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.440" end="00:48:23.239" style="s2">Sam the thing I like I&#39;ve heard people</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.930" end="00:48:25.190" style="s2">try to analyze Arjuna&#39;s form of logic</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.239" end="00:48:27.469" style="s2">compared to Aristotle&#39;s form of logic</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.190" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">and I feel like they&#39;re missing points</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.469" end="00:48:32.119" style="s2">in it I feel like what he&#39;s doing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:34.940" style="s2">taking his feeling attention back and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.119" end="00:48:37.569" style="s2">forth over a distinction until that</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.940" end="00:48:40.430" style="s2">distinction transcendentally blurs out</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.569" end="00:48:42.499" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to see that the descendant</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.430" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">of that kind of cognitive approach in</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.499" end="00:48:47.029" style="s2">the Zen tradition where you do go man</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:48.920" style="s2">and forth across a distinction where</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.029" end="00:48:50.930" style="s2">it&#39;s almost seems impossible that these</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.920" end="00:48:52.729" style="s2">two things should coincide but as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.930" end="00:48:58.390" style="s2">keep going back and forth something</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.729" end="00:49:01.640" style="s2">happens to you hmm I love that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.390" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">that seems true or useful way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.640" end="00:49:08.269" style="s2">at it yeah right well a podcast again</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">what would you what would you love to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.269" end="00:49:14.779" style="s2">like what if your resources to make</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:15.979" style="s2">online content were suddenly doubled or</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.779" end="00:49:21.380" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.979" end="00:49:33.769" style="s2">Wow except for you suddenly doubled</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.380" end="00:49:35.539" style="s2">would not actually be that much well</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.769" end="00:49:39.019" style="s2">imagine a number that actually provides</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.539" end="00:49:42.849" style="s2">a significant number of some kind yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.019" end="00:49:46.489" style="s2">yeah I would love to travel to different</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.849" end="00:49:49.729" style="s2">you know emerging experimental neo</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.489" end="00:49:52.969" style="s2">monastic communities and make like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.729" end="00:49:56.779" style="s2">video series about what I find there and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.969" end="00:49:58.999" style="s2">kind of try to weave a network between</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.779" end="00:50:00.469" style="s2">those spaces particularly like people</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.999" end="00:50:02.089" style="s2">that are experimenting with Ecology&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.469" end="00:50:03.589" style="s2">practice and a really deliver away like</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.089" end="00:50:06.019" style="s2">we hear it we are here at the monastic</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.589" end="00:50:07.549" style="s2">Academy my sense is that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.019" end="00:50:09.890" style="s2">we&#39;re at the very beginning of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.549" end="00:50:14.239" style="s2">planetary Renaissance when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.890" end="00:50:16.969" style="s2">those sorts of spaces and I would love</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.239" end="00:50:17.390" style="s2">to open up pathways of learning between</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.969" end="00:50:20.690" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.390" end="00:50:23.930" style="s2">nodes you know Jim refers to them as</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.690" end="00:50:28.400" style="s2">kind of like proto B communities proto</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.930" end="00:50:31.730" style="s2">game B communities and I yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.400" end="00:50:33.290" style="s2">sometimes dream about you know somehow</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.730" end="00:50:36.470" style="s2">moving from community to community</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.290" end="00:50:39.740" style="s2">learning and sharing best practices</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.470" end="00:50:42.770" style="s2">between all of them and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.740" end="00:50:44.060" style="s2">wonderful but besides that I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.770" end="00:50:46.670" style="s2">nice thing about what I could do is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.060" end="00:50:49.460" style="s2">very low low costs so I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.670" end="00:50:53.600" style="s2">that I&#39;d want to make it much bigger in</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.460" end="00:50:56.150" style="s2">any way yeah it would be nice to travel</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.600" end="00:50:58.010" style="s2">in a different context with it I go to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.150" end="00:51:00.710" style="s2">visit my mother in Puerto Rico and her</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.010" end="00:51:03.050" style="s2">husband was in a Gurdjieff Ian group</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.710" end="00:51:04.670" style="s2">that lived in the tropics for equal they</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.050" end="00:51:06.890" style="s2">were part of the people cool eyes her</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.670" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">project together back in the day right</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.890" end="00:51:13.400" style="s2">on the people who were in the community</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:15.800" style="s2">and who&#39;ve left they stay in touch but</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.400" end="00:51:17.900" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re like post community</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.800" end="00:51:19.220" style="s2">they&#39;ve all got reflections now and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.900" end="00:51:20.660" style="s2">they&#39;ve balanced it with other parts of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.220" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">their lives those people really</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.660" end="00:51:25.100" style="s2">intrigued me you know when they get</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:26.660" style="s2">together at for dinner saying I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.100" end="00:51:28.970" style="s2">love to be able to record and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.660" end="00:51:31.880" style="s2">orchestrate that dinner a little bit hmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.970" end="00:51:33.770" style="s2">the people who&#39;ve blossomed out of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.880" end="00:51:36.830" style="s2">specific context they were in but still</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.770" end="00:51:38.240" style="s2">bring all that stuff with them what</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.830" end="00:51:40.070" style="s2">would intrigues you about that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.240" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">perspective or that um here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.070" end="00:51:44.810" style="s2">love but I&#39;m fascinated by the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:48.740" style="s2">of the communities I&#39;m fascinated by the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.810" end="00:51:51.140" style="s2">practices effectiveness I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.740" end="00:51:53.570" style="s2">about the limitations of groupthink in</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.140" end="00:51:56.630" style="s2">particular languaging and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.570" end="00:51:58.670" style="s2">interested in how specific bodies of</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.630" end="00:52:00.670" style="s2">teaching and practice rub up against the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.670" end="00:52:03.350" style="s2">complexity of the rest of our lives</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.670" end="00:52:04.970" style="s2">yeah people who&#39;ve come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.350" end="00:52:06.740" style="s2">context but are still connected to it</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.970" end="00:52:12.440" style="s2">are in a real nice position to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.740" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">something yeah so true I mean I&#39;ll tell</p>

<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:20.660" style="s2">I lived here about four years ago for</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.740" end="00:52:22.540" style="s2">two years and then I left and moved back</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.660" end="00:52:25.370" style="s2">to Boulder where I&#39;ve lived off and on</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.540" end="00:52:27.620" style="s2">for two years before I came back and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.370" end="00:52:29.360" style="s2">that that time in between I actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.620" end="00:52:31.160" style="s2">recommend that people who have been here</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.360" end="00:52:34.340" style="s2">for some years I recommended</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.160" end="00:52:36.890" style="s2">leave because it&#39;s like you say leaving</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.340" end="00:52:38.930" style="s2">space like this just completely</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.890" end="00:52:41.150" style="s2">transforms your relationship with it</p>

<p begin="00:52:41.150" end="00:52:45.830" style="s2">just yeah you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:47.390" style="s2">maybe that would be fascinating to talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.830" end="00:52:48.920" style="s2">to get it gathered with the people who</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.390" end="00:52:50.780" style="s2">had spent significant time in community</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.920" end="00:52:51.350" style="s2">and have them reflect on and what that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.780" end="00:52:53.720" style="s2">was like</p>

<p begin="00:53:01.820" end="00:53:10.850" style="s2">that I do I can see all the ways they</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:13.190" style="s2">disagree with each other some</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.850" end="00:53:15.620" style="s2">communities think that the the fourth</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.420" end="00:54:26.210" style="s2">curious about your perspective I I know</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.180" end="00:54:30.410" style="s2">that you written for the interval review</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.210" end="00:54:32.300" style="s2">and you had a couple I think articles in</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.210" end="00:54:45.240" style="s2">and in particular like I have a personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:49.619" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.240" end="00:54:52.770" style="s2">in drawing connections between that way</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.619" end="00:54:54.480" style="s2">of looking and the approach that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.770" end="00:54:55.980" style="s2">mentioned before the soul making Dharma</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:54:59.940" style="s2">because I see that as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.980" end="00:55:03.150" style="s2">paradigmatic post metaphysical spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.940" end="00:55:09.060" style="s2">praxis and so I am I&#39;m very curious</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.150" end="00:55:10.230" style="s2">about what symmetries exists there but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.060" end="00:55:16.830" style="s2">also don&#39;t know that make for very</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.230" end="00:55:18.450" style="s2">compelling media content well anybody</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.830" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">could stop listening at this point if</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.450" end="00:55:34.050" style="s2">they want to it&#39;s interesting stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:36.060" style="s2">like to go into it you know briefly and</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.050" end="00:55:38.880" style="s2">intensely and come back out and I like</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.060" end="00:55:42.140" style="s2">to dwell too long in that really there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.880" end="00:55:44.190" style="s2">just some intense beautiful Byzantine</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.140" end="00:55:46.560" style="s2">philosophical and logical approaches</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.190" end="00:55:48.780" style="s2">involved you know trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.560" end="00:55:51.780" style="s2">the relationship between whether things</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.780" end="00:55:53.609" style="s2">have the equivalent of an inherent</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.780" end="00:55:55.500" style="s2">essence despite the fact that all our</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.609" end="00:55:56.390" style="s2">experience of them is relative and</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.500" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.390" end="00:56:02.190" style="s2">you know how much what can you take as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:04.830" style="s2">given even even given that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.190" end="00:56:06.810" style="s2">approaching the world through the types</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.830" end="00:56:08.369" style="s2">of meditative contemplative and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.810" end="00:56:10.530" style="s2">spiritual techniques that people have</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.369" end="00:56:12.300" style="s2">used throughout history and they&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.530" end="00:56:15.090" style="s2">them in the context of assuming all</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.300" end="00:56:18.480" style="s2">these Givens that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.090" end="00:56:22.460" style="s2">question to me but I&#39;m focused on most</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.480" end="00:56:25.580" style="s2">is how do you describe the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.460" end="00:56:28.230" style="s2">phenomenological validity and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.580" end="00:56:29.850" style="s2">effectiveness of practice found in</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.230" end="00:56:31.980" style="s2">spiritual and religious traditions</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.850" end="00:56:39.330" style="s2">without making any assumptions about</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.980" end="00:56:43.230" style="s2">what exists oh that&#39;s so good yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.330" end="00:56:47.850" style="s2">do you well my my tendency is to think</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.230" end="00:56:49.980" style="s2">of it as an orchestration of functional</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.850" end="00:56:52.200" style="s2">sub components to produce a surplus</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.980" end="00:56:53.910" style="s2">resonance which we can then interact</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.200" end="00:56:56.490" style="s2">with well as we&#39;ve produced it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.910" end="00:56:58.920" style="s2">that&#39;s individually that looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.490" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">higher thing about</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.920" end="00:57:04.320" style="s2">collectively it looks like thing about a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:05.910" style="s2">community and we can look at an extra</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.320" end="00:57:07.380" style="s2">thing through different lenses we could</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.910" end="00:57:10.050" style="s2">look at it through a first-person lens</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.380" end="00:57:12.360" style="s2">and say well that&#39;s my higher or deeper</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.050" end="00:57:15.540" style="s2">experience of myself we look in a second</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.360" end="00:57:17.970" style="s2">person lens and say it was as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.540" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">a higher person or entity that I related</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.970" end="00:57:23.100" style="s2">to look at it objectively and say it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.640" end="00:57:25.830" style="s2">as if it was a higher energy or</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.100" end="00:57:28.410" style="s2">experience I was drawn into hmmm these</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.830" end="00:57:30.360" style="s2">options but they all play off this thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.410" end="00:57:32.790" style="s2">that can be produced in our experience</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.360" end="00:57:35.910" style="s2">by certain kinds of practices and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.790" end="00:57:38.610" style="s2">think it&#39;s plausible to find the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.910" end="00:57:41.340" style="s2">through-line in very diverse spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.610" end="00:57:45.690" style="s2">practices of of combining our subjective</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.340" end="00:57:48.120" style="s2">systems by like my body or the chakras</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.690" end="00:57:49.800" style="s2">or left and right or our perception of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.120" end="00:57:52.050" style="s2">ourself and our perception of the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.800" end="00:57:53.670" style="s2">or our perception of the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.050" end="00:57:56.220" style="s2">and our perception of the world like</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.670" end="00:57:58.860" style="s2">these are all subjectively active</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.220" end="00:58:01.260" style="s2">systems that we have within us and most</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.860" end="00:58:03.090" style="s2">cheerful practices involve some enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.260" end="00:58:05.970" style="s2">coordination between these subjective</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.090" end="00:58:08.550" style="s2">systems to the point where it succeeds</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.970" end="00:58:28.950" style="s2">into a numinous extra that we then have</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.550" end="00:58:38.010" style="s2">valuable seems so pleasant for me I</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.950" end="00:58:43.470" style="s2">guess if we wanted that correspond to my</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.010" end="00:58:46.950" style="s2">understanding in in my world of one type</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.470" end="00:58:50.700" style="s2">of practice of like Samadhi practiced I</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.950" end="00:58:54.030" style="s2">had harmonized all of the systems as you</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.700" end="00:58:56.370" style="s2">say and that in the retreat I just did</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.030" end="00:58:58.530" style="s2">the I was practicing with the approach</p>

<p begin="00:58:58.530" end="00:59:03.570" style="s2">like numinous experience of the jhanas</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.470" end="00:59:04.940" style="s2">perhaps although in buddhism obviously</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.570" end="00:59:07.560" style="s2">that&#39;s not understood as being</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.940" end="00:59:12.180" style="s2">transcendental it&#39;s just a very refined</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.560" end="00:59:17.569" style="s2">material experience but the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.180" end="00:59:20.279" style="s2">way that I have resolved that problems I</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.569" end="00:59:21.480" style="s2">helped design the curriculum here at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.279" end="00:59:25.380" style="s2">monastic Academy and one of my</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.480" end="00:59:26.970" style="s2">curiosities is how do we talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.380" end="00:59:32.510" style="s2">happens when you do these practices</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.970" end="00:59:34.289" style="s2">intensively without using the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.510" end="00:59:38.039" style="s2">epistemologies of the dominant culture</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.289" end="00:59:39.990" style="s2">like materialism or you know rendering</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.039" end="00:59:44.089" style="s2">interpret the self gets or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.990" end="00:59:48.420" style="s2">like that and typically the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.089" end="00:59:51.150" style="s2">talk about it is as that we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.420" end="00:59:54.059" style="s2">with perception we&#39;re learning how</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.150" end="00:59:55.470" style="s2">perception works that&#39;s it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.059" end="00:59:57.990" style="s2">actually all we&#39;re doing is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.470" end="01:00:00.589" style="s2">we&#39;re learning how to participate with</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.990" end="01:00:03.270" style="s2">our perception in ways that either</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.589" end="01:00:07.529" style="s2">relieve suffering or amplify</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.270" end="01:00:11.730" style="s2">meaningfulness that&#39;s it that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.529" end="01:00:13.260" style="s2">and so you can in that way I do I find</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.730" end="01:00:15.390" style="s2">this equative like it&#39;s quite a simple</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.260" end="01:00:17.789" style="s2">way to not make any unnecessary claims</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.390" end="01:00:19.589" style="s2">but still retain the potency because it</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.789" end="01:00:24.150" style="s2">turns out the perception is empty and</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.589" end="01:00:26.520" style="s2">you can just play in that space and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.150" end="01:00:27.809" style="s2">includes everything you know it turns</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.520" end="01:00:29.789" style="s2">out that everything is perception so</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.809" end="01:00:32.490" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very inclusive way of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.789" end="01:00:37.319" style="s2">presenting things to how does that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.490" end="01:00:39.150" style="s2">clear I don&#39;t see any irresolvable</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.319" end="01:00:42.299" style="s2">problem between that and what I just</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.150" end="01:00:44.099" style="s2">said maybe think of different approaches</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.299" end="01:00:45.839" style="s2">to perception and how they can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.099" end="01:00:49.220" style="s2">conceived of as coordinating these</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.839" end="01:00:52.589" style="s2">different parts so for example right</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.220" end="01:00:54.660" style="s2">intentional attention exercises where</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.589" end="01:00:57.270" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna focus on purpose or sustain</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.660" end="01:00:59.069" style="s2">a purposeful focus that allows a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.270" end="01:01:01.619" style="s2">parts to come together on the same</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.069" end="01:01:04.440" style="s2">project in the way that riding a bicycle</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.619" end="01:01:07.039" style="s2">involves many like lateral things being</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.440" end="01:01:09.750" style="s2">drawn together in the forward motion</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.039" end="01:01:12.809" style="s2">it&#39;s also a kind of like if I just</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.750" end="01:01:15.990" style="s2">wanted to perceive everything in an open</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.809" end="01:01:18.270" style="s2">way in order to do that I have to dial</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.990" end="01:01:20.279" style="s2">down things I&#39;m privileged in my focus</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.270" end="01:01:23.819" style="s2">and kind of dial up things I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.279" end="01:01:25.770" style="s2">privileged a kind of equilibrium our</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.819" end="01:01:27.869" style="s2">parsimony patients yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.770" end="01:01:29.550" style="s2">right yeah now they&#39;re in a position to</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.869" end="01:01:31.380" style="s2">be balanced together I&#39;m already</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.550" end="01:01:33.750" style="s2">perceiving them but now I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.380" end="01:01:35.580" style="s2">perceive them with relatively equivalent</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.750" end="01:01:38.040" style="s2">focus and that&#39;s where they can start to</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.580" end="01:01:39.810" style="s2">blend together to produce this slightly</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.040" end="01:01:41.730" style="s2">more than the sum of its parts thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.810" end="01:01:45.270" style="s2">that might come forward to me are those</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.730" end="01:01:48.180" style="s2">conditions of practice yeah well but I</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.270" end="01:01:51.030" style="s2">guess my question for you then is or hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.180" end="01:01:53.840" style="s2">I&#39;m it again play my my biases is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.030" end="01:01:55.740" style="s2">you know what it&#39;s all about is about</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.840" end="01:01:58.619" style="s2">deeper and deeper realizations of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.740" end="01:02:00.840" style="s2">emptiness the empty nature of things of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.619" end="01:02:03.330" style="s2">procession I I don&#39;t it&#39;s not obvious to</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.840" end="01:02:05.790" style="s2">me how that fits into your the way that</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.330" end="01:02:08.869" style="s2">you&#39;re constructing it is it like so so</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.790" end="01:02:12.840" style="s2">yes you can harmonize different systems</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.869" end="01:02:15.630" style="s2">within your experience but fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.840" end="01:02:17.970" style="s2">liberation happens to the degree that</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.630" end="01:02:20.400" style="s2">you see you know systems and all those</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.970" end="01:02:22.020" style="s2">perceptions and all those even the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.400" end="01:02:27.150" style="s2">harmony itself and all that so what how</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.020" end="01:02:29.730" style="s2">does that square let me take emptiness</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.150" end="01:02:32.310" style="s2">in at least three directions on the one</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.730" end="01:02:35.310" style="s2">hand yeah there&#39;s the assertion of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.310" end="01:02:37.590" style="s2">ontological emptiness of things right is</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.310" end="01:02:39.270" style="s2">that assertion justified or not we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.590" end="01:02:42.180" style="s2">know emptiness itself is empty of</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.270" end="01:02:45.150" style="s2">emptiness yes right and and to some</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.180" end="01:02:47.430" style="s2">degree enos the cognitive idea of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.150" end="01:02:50.820" style="s2">absence might be problematic right there</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.430" end="01:02:52.590" style="s2">might be a knee allistic hint in some of</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.820" end="01:02:53.990" style="s2">that phrasing depending on who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.590" end="01:02:58.050" style="s2">talking to about</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.990" end="01:03:01.830" style="s2">secondarily one way to think of</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.050" end="01:03:04.140" style="s2">emptiness is as an extra present quality</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.830" end="01:03:07.220" style="s2">which exceeds the objects of cognition</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.140" end="01:03:09.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s an description of this</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.220" end="01:03:12.060" style="s2">numinous more than the sum of its parts</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.240" end="01:03:15.060" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got all the things then</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.060" end="01:03:17.730" style="s2">there&#39;s this other something whether we</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.060" end="01:03:20.100" style="s2">call it a penis or energy or presence or</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.730" end="01:03:24.119" style="s2">God or whatever it&#39;s just not any of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.100" end="01:03:26.340" style="s2">things and it allows those things to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.119" end="01:03:29.040" style="s2">full of themselves and also to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.340" end="01:03:31.430" style="s2">coordinated but it also isn&#39;t limited by</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.040" end="01:03:35.880" style="s2">any of the combinations of those and</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.430" end="01:03:38.790" style="s2">then the third way I go at it is in</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.880" end="01:03:39.510" style="s2">order to achieve higher coordination of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.790" end="01:03:42.540" style="s2">the parts</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.510" end="01:03:44.580" style="s2">you need more spaciousness right same as</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.540" end="01:03:46.830" style="s2">if your muscles were all not your</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.580" end="01:03:49.410" style="s2">functional coordination is decreased</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.830" end="01:03:51.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a spacing out so like when</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.410" end="01:03:53.760" style="s2">you see the atoms that make up the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.120" end="01:03:55.430" style="s2">molecule now there&#39;s another whole range</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:03:58.230" style="s2">of coordination x&#39; to consider</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.430" end="01:04:00.270" style="s2">everywhere you find this extra</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.230" end="01:04:02.340" style="s2">spaciousness if you found the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.270" end="01:04:11.660" style="s2">availability to an enhanced coordination</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.340" end="01:04:20.610" style="s2">that you hadn&#39;t considered before huh I</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.660" end="01:04:24.240" style="s2">love that yeah yeah I mean that it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.610" end="01:04:28.380" style="s2">would be I would like I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.240" end="01:04:30.390" style="s2">feel like we have time to go all the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.380" end="01:04:31.890" style="s2">into this but I would love to sit down</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.390" end="01:04:36.690" style="s2">with you sometime and just really</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.890" end="01:04:39.360" style="s2">explore I feel like I want I have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.690" end="01:04:41.970" style="s2">desire to reconcile my under like the</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.360" end="01:04:47.040" style="s2">system that I practice in with what</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.970" end="01:04:49.050" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and it would be I think it</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.040" end="01:04:57.360" style="s2">would be fun for me to do as a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.050" end="01:04:58.230" style="s2">game but I don&#39;t know we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.360" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">do that right now</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.230" end="01:05:02.820" style="s2">yeah I would love that let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:05.370" style="s2">because these are some of the pool the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.820" end="01:05:08.460" style="s2">most passionately interesting topics in</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.370" end="01:05:10.740" style="s2">my heart yeah well one thing I will say</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.460" end="01:05:13.770" style="s2">though I&#39;ll be curiously just on this</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.740" end="01:05:15.950" style="s2">one one one piece is that the first part</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.770" end="01:05:18.150" style="s2">that you said around whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.950" end="01:05:23.460" style="s2">emptiness can be considered a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.150" end="01:05:26.130" style="s2">ontological truth it you know from where</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.460" end="01:05:28.980" style="s2">I&#39;m coming from it that matters less</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.130" end="01:05:32.250" style="s2">than whether or not adopting it as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.980" end="01:05:33.660" style="s2">provisional truth liberates and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.250" end="01:05:37.950" style="s2">much I think that we can be quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.660" end="01:05:41.870" style="s2">confident in and so that again is why I</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.950" end="01:05:44.880" style="s2">think it&#39;s of great benefit to ground</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.870" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">everything in perception because then</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.880" end="01:05:55.460" style="s2">ontology actually becomes inactive</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:57.920" style="s2">within the context of using different</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.460" end="01:06:00.280" style="s2">ways of seeing to interface with</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.920" end="01:06:04.370" style="s2">perception or to perceive differently</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.280" end="01:06:07.060" style="s2">and emptiness then is just one method of</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.370" end="01:06:11.450" style="s2">experimentation that just happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.060" end="01:06:13.820" style="s2">really baller and good you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.450" end="01:06:15.850" style="s2">resolving occasional hypothesis of</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.820" end="01:06:21.020" style="s2">emptiness has produced a great number of</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.850" end="01:06:23.420" style="s2">significant results over the millennia I</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.020" end="01:06:25.340" style="s2">would probably tweak the description</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.420" end="01:06:28.280" style="s2">there a little bit and say that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.340" end="01:06:30.800" style="s2">producing the results in my mind is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.280" end="01:06:34.250" style="s2">addition of the hypothesis of emptiness</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.800" end="01:06:36.710" style="s2">to the normal experience of the</p>
