<p begin="00:00:12.830" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">developing things to improve cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">function they&#39;re their only product out</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:26.939" style="s2">now is a nootropic called</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">qualia which is basically to supercharge</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.939" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">your brain and so when I went into this</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">conversation I had intended to talk all</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:38.280" style="s2">about nootropics and ways to you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:40.379" style="s2">what are some some legal medicines that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.280" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">people can take to improve their their</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.379" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">brain function but what we actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:47.960" style="s2">ended up talking about was first off how</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">- what would are basically the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.960" end="00:00:55.559" style="s2">prerequisites for someone to be meeting</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:58.469" style="s2">before using these types of supplements</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.559" end="00:01:00.570" style="s2">so we talked about adrenal fatigue and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.469" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">how to know if you&#39;re drinking too much</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.570" end="00:01:06.119" style="s2">caffeine we talked about sleep a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:08.430" style="s2">bit about nutrition because the basic</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.119" end="00:01:11.220" style="s2">premise is that if you don&#39;t have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.430" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">of these basic or all of these basics</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.220" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">down pat then it&#39;s like putting a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">turbocharger and I&#39;m using his wording</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">here a turbocharger in a car without an</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">engine so putting a turbocharger in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">car without an engine what means that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">the car will go nowhere but if you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:32.850" style="s2">an engine without a turbocharger then</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">your car will still move so we talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.850" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">about the engine portion of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">on this one and then we&#39;re going to do a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">follow-up soon Daniel is an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">intelligent guy and I learned a ton from</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">the show what&#39;s up everyone this is Mike</p>

<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">timber ger co-founder and director of Rd</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:58.619" style="s2">at neuro hacker collectives Daniel I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.280" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">know you&#39;re an incredibly busy guy thank</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">you so much for making some time to do</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">to be here with you this is fun awesome</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">so we you know before before the show</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:13.379" style="s2">started just now we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:16.739" style="s2">my personal experience with cats</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.379" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">and the fact that I&#39;ve been taking way</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.739" end="00:02:21.629" style="s2">too much caffeine and I got off</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:24.090" style="s2">completely for a couple weeks ago and as</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.629" end="00:02:26.549" style="s2">we got into conversation about it it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:27.780" style="s2">sounds like I may need to take quite a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.549" end="00:02:29.730" style="s2">bit more time off</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.780" end="00:02:31.769" style="s2">and so I thought it might be an</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.730" end="00:02:34.230" style="s2">interesting place to start because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.769" end="00:02:36.120" style="s2">of my listeners I know are caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.230" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">addicts right there&#39;s there&#39;s even a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.120" end="00:02:40.769" style="s2">company in the CrossFit space called and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:43.230" style="s2">weightlifting space called caffeine and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.769" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">kilos and it&#39;s very you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">romanticized and people just love their</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">coffee and so I think this this would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:53.819" style="s2">a really useful conversation for us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:56.579" style="s2">kind of start out with for people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.819" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">know if you know they if they might need</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.579" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">to do the same thing that I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:05.389" style="s2">do so what is what are the signs that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:10.579" style="s2">someone is taking too much caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.389" end="00:03:13.220" style="s2">mm-hmm so step back a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.579" end="00:03:16.739" style="s2">recognize that the caffeine is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.220" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">psychoactive chemical compound right we</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.739" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">can say it&#39;s a psychoactive drug and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:25.349" style="s2">it&#39;s one of humanity&#39;s favorite ones up</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:28.819" style="s2">there with alcohol and cannabis etc for</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.349" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">a very long time from tea and coffee and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.819" end="00:03:37.699" style="s2">you know many sources and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:41.159" style="s2">beautiful molecule and can actually have</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.699" end="00:03:43.199" style="s2">life extension and life enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.159" end="00:03:44.819" style="s2">properties used rightly and like any</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.199" end="00:03:46.470" style="s2">tool and especially the more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.819" end="00:03:52.979" style="s2">tool can also have life damaging</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.470" end="00:03:55.319" style="s2">properties used improperly and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.979" end="00:03:57.780" style="s2">pretty easy to misuse caffeine the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.319" end="00:04:00.120" style="s2">easiest way to misuse caffeine is to use</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.780" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">it to deal with tiredness from not</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.120" end="00:04:06.510" style="s2">resting enough so if someone is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:10.889" style="s2">sleeping enough or they&#39;re not sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.510" end="00:04:12.989" style="s2">well and the way they notice that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.889" end="00:04:14.939" style="s2">that they&#39;re either tired in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.989" end="00:04:16.440" style="s2">when they wake up say to in long they</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.939" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">don&#39;t feel fully rested or they get</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.440" end="00:04:22.760" style="s2">tired in the afternoon their answer to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:25.409" style="s2">it rather than to rest is to stimulate</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.760" end="00:04:26.780" style="s2">that&#39;s how adrenal fatigue and burnout</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.409" end="00:04:30.650" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.780" end="00:04:32.930" style="s2">and so we kind of paradoxically caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.650" end="00:04:36.940" style="s2">is best used when people are already</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.930" end="00:04:40.580" style="s2">energized and they are then using it for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.940" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">enhancement of metabolic activity in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.580" end="00:04:47.420" style="s2">already healthy system that can handle</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:50.840" style="s2">the stimulus as opposed to in a under</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.420" end="00:04:52.520" style="s2">rested under you know operating system</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.840" end="00:04:54.230" style="s2">that can&#39;t really handle the stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.520" end="00:04:56.360" style="s2">without damage so that&#39;s the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.230" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">thing and there are so many people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.360" end="00:05:02.620" style="s2">use caffeine as a like as if it is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:05.780" style="s2">replacement for adequate or good sleep</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.620" end="00:05:08.540" style="s2">or good rest in other ways and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.780" end="00:05:09.169" style="s2">that is a very fast way to make it very</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.540" end="00:05:12.230" style="s2">bad for you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.169" end="00:05:14.990" style="s2">right so what you&#39;re kind of suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.230" end="00:05:17.870" style="s2">it sounds like is that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.990" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">biggest benefits of caffeine is more to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.870" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">do with the metabolism rather than to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:24.380" style="s2">with boosting your energy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:27.790" style="s2">stimulating you in that sort of way is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.380" end="00:05:30.410" style="s2">that is that what I&#39;m hearing when even</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.790" end="00:05:31.669" style="s2">regarding the kind of stimulant</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.410" end="00:05:33.950" style="s2">properties the central nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.669" end="00:05:35.870" style="s2">stimulant properties the way it inhibits</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.950" end="00:05:38.780" style="s2">adenosine the way that it has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.870" end="00:05:41.720" style="s2">dopaminergic effect those still work</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.780" end="00:05:43.940" style="s2">much better on a well-rested system that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.720" end="00:05:45.590" style="s2">can handle being stimulated without</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.940" end="00:05:47.780" style="s2">being damaged right because if a system</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.590" end="00:05:49.850" style="s2">is getting tired it means the body is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.780" end="00:05:51.350" style="s2">endogenously down regulating rather than</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.850" end="00:05:53.720" style="s2">up regulating because it wants to be an</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.350" end="00:05:56.630" style="s2">arrest and repair point place rather</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.720" end="00:05:59.300" style="s2">than in a you know fully on and utilized</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.630" end="00:06:01.010" style="s2">place so when the body needs to be an</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.300" end="00:06:03.350" style="s2">arrest and repair place and we stimulate</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.010" end="00:06:06.340" style="s2">it to be in a non place that is at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.350" end="00:06:09.830" style="s2">cost of the integrity of the system</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.340" end="00:06:13.940" style="s2">gotcha so that&#39;s the first big thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.830" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">with regard to caffeine is it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.940" end="00:06:18.530" style="s2">critical that caffeine is not being used</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:21.020" style="s2">because it&#39;s needed it&#39;s being used when</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.530" end="00:06:23.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not needed as an enhancement to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.020" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">system gods raden that&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.900" end="00:06:28.220" style="s2">caffeine that&#39;s if someone&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:31.550" style="s2">nicotine so using theobromine if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.220" end="00:06:35.150" style="s2">using any kind of stimulant</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.550" end="00:06:39.169" style="s2">it&#39;s important to eat that in mind so</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.150" end="00:06:40.110" style="s2">before we go into how to identify if</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.169" end="00:06:42.120" style="s2">someone is you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.110" end="00:06:44.700" style="s2">taking too much of caffeine or any</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.120" end="00:06:47.100" style="s2">stimulant why is it even important like</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.700" end="00:06:51.530" style="s2">you know what what are the the dangers</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.100" end="00:06:51.530" style="s2">to someone&#39;s performance and even health</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.190" end="00:07:00.120" style="s2">yeah so many things if if you look at a</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.120" end="00:07:04.230" style="s2">is a neuro chemical that helps bring on</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.010" end="00:07:07.410" style="s2">the sleep impulse and so caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.230" end="00:07:09.000" style="s2">inhibits that molecule if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.410" end="00:07:11.370" style="s2">to inhibit it when it&#39;s coming on strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.000" end="00:07:13.980" style="s2">because it needs to come on then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.370" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">end up getting imbalances in your</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:19.410" style="s2">cycles which will look like not getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.790" end="00:07:21.540" style="s2">as good a quality sleep in not getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.410" end="00:07:23.490" style="s2">it&#39;s not repaired during your sleep it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.540" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">can then look like resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.490" end="00:07:28.620" style="s2">adenosine inhibition and so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:31.170" style="s2">notice that by having less of an effect</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.620" end="00:07:33.390" style="s2">from coffee where you can take coffee or</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.170" end="00:07:35.430" style="s2">any source of caffeine and still fall</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.390" end="00:07:38.220" style="s2">asleep afterwards that means that your</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.220" end="00:07:45.810" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s bitten down regulated</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.420" end="00:07:49.860" style="s2">and then specifically adrenal fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.810" end="00:07:52.710" style="s2">and adrenal burnout happens largely when</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.860" end="00:07:54.360" style="s2">you continue to stress a system that has</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:56.250" style="s2">been stressed and now needs to repair</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.360" end="00:07:59.310" style="s2">before we give it adequate repair and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.250" end="00:08:02.130" style="s2">when you understand all of the roles of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.310" end="00:08:04.140" style="s2">the renal glands have in converting</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.130" end="00:08:06.180" style="s2">neurologic impulse to endocrine impulse</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.140" end="00:08:13.050" style="s2">you know it&#39;s involved in fat metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.180" end="00:08:15.450" style="s2">and muscle repair and lean body muscle</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.050" end="00:08:17.700" style="s2">mass it&#39;s involved in everything from</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.450" end="00:08:19.380" style="s2">genetic transcription to the regulation</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.700" end="00:08:23.030" style="s2">of the rest of the endocrine system to</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.030" end="00:08:27.600" style="s2">over stimulating and over taxing your</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.620" end="00:08:30.570" style="s2">adrenal system is definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.600" end="00:08:33.150" style="s2">something somebody wants to do got it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.570" end="00:08:34.920" style="s2">how how what are some signs were some</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.150" end="00:08:36.420" style="s2">other signs that people can look for</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.920" end="00:08:41.520" style="s2">where some tests they can give</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.420" end="00:08:44.190" style="s2">themselves yeah one of the common ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.520" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">is that the stimulating effect that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.190" end="00:08:48.810" style="s2">caffeine had early in someone&#39;s use it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:52.050" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have anymore and that&#39;s the sign</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.810" end="00:08:54.100" style="s2">of desensitization down regulation so</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.050" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">they used to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.100" end="00:08:59.860" style="s2">eight ounces of coffee and feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:03.250" style="s2">increased wakefulness now they have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.860" end="00:09:07.480" style="s2">drink more coffee to still notice a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.250" end="00:09:08.680" style="s2">smaller effect if you used to not be</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.480" end="00:09:10.120" style="s2">able to fall asleep on coffee and now</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.680" end="00:09:12.630" style="s2">you can fall asleep on it if you need</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.120" end="00:09:15.220" style="s2">more than you used to need if you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.630" end="00:09:17.019" style="s2">having a sense of needing it or needing</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.220" end="00:09:20.380" style="s2">it more times in the course of a day</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.019" end="00:09:22.509" style="s2">later into the day if you&#39;re noticing</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.380" end="00:09:25.569" style="s2">the effects less these are all signs of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.509" end="00:09:28.029" style="s2">desensitization down-regulation so one</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.569" end="00:09:32.470" style="s2">of the key things with pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.029" end="00:09:34.360" style="s2">anything is in terms of anything that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.470" end="00:09:39.009" style="s2">we&#39;re taking in other than like water</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.360" end="00:09:41.199" style="s2">and air is cycling and so just like with</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.009" end="00:09:43.240" style="s2">workouts you need to have cycles between</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.199" end="00:09:45.100" style="s2">stressing the muscles and then letting</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.240" end="00:09:46.660" style="s2">them rest and repair and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.100" end="00:09:47.709" style="s2">kind of cycle between different workouts</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.660" end="00:09:50.350" style="s2">because if you keep doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.709" end="00:09:52.420" style="s2">workout you start to desensitize to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.350" end="00:09:53.889" style="s2">particular stimulus and you will get</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.420" end="00:09:57.759" style="s2">less from it than if you cycle it -</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.889" end="00:09:59.529" style="s2">another way of stressing muscle and if</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.759" end="00:10:00.939" style="s2">you think of it from a evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.529" end="00:10:02.019" style="s2">point of view in terms of chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.939" end="00:10:03.730" style="s2">coming into the body</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.019" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">pretty much other than water there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.730" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">no food source that was always available</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:11.410" style="s2">all year round and so our body was</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:13.720" style="s2">consistently getting different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.410" end="00:10:16.740" style="s2">chemical input and then regulating in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.720" end="00:10:20.380" style="s2">hunter-gatherer kind of environment so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.740" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">rotating our foods and rotating our</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.380" end="00:10:23.889" style="s2">supplements and etc is valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.660" end="00:10:25.300" style="s2">different ones need to rotate on</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.889" end="00:10:29.980" style="s2">different cycles there are some things</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.300" end="00:10:31.930" style="s2">that down regulate quickly like say some</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.980" end="00:10:34.569" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a supplement but you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.930" end="00:10:39.069" style="s2">from a from a kind of neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.569" end="00:10:41.319" style="s2">point of view if someone does MDMA they</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.069" end="00:10:44.380" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do that many times before</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.319" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">their system will start to acclimate to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.380" end="00:10:48.759" style="s2">it down regulate and then have pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:52.149" style="s2">bad symptomology if they stop doing in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.759" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">so someone really shouldn&#39;t do that more</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.149" end="00:10:56.199" style="s2">than and it&#39;s going to depend on their</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:57.250" style="s2">individual physiology some people might</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.199" end="00:10:59.170" style="s2">be able do it a couple times a month</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.250" end="00:11:01.959" style="s2">some people only once every several</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.170" end="00:11:05.260" style="s2">months so the cycle there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.959" end="00:11:07.810" style="s2">relatively little on lots of off whereas</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.260" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">say someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.810" end="00:11:12.460" style="s2">is taking resistant starch as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:14.110" style="s2">prebiotic they can take that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.460" end="00:11:16.300" style="s2">time but pretty much anything should be</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.110" end="00:11:19.360" style="s2">cycled off now and again with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.300" end="00:11:22.150" style="s2">caffeine it&#39;s it&#39;s actually a molecule</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.360" end="00:11:24.279" style="s2">that people habituate to and then get a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.150" end="00:11:27.160" style="s2">low level of addiction or dependence</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.279" end="00:11:28.870" style="s2">quite quickly which is the the signal of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.160" end="00:11:33.640" style="s2">that is getting headaches when you come</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.870" end="00:11:36.040" style="s2">off of it and so letting people stay in</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.640" end="00:11:38.050" style="s2">an on cycle longer so that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.040" end="00:11:40.300" style="s2">dealing would say you know headaches</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.050" end="00:11:43.060" style="s2">every week is a cycling off you know on</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.300" end="00:11:44.680" style="s2">the weekend the general recommendation I</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.060" end="00:11:47.050" style="s2">get to most people is if they want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.680" end="00:11:49.300" style="s2">use caffeine regularly as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.050" end="00:11:50.770" style="s2">just now and again which i think is fine</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.300" end="00:11:54.580" style="s2">to do if you&#39;re sleeping enough and not</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.770" end="00:11:57.190" style="s2">overusing it is give or take one week</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.580" end="00:12:01.300" style="s2">every quarter you come off of it and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.190" end="00:12:03.029" style="s2">first couple days suck you can take a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.300" end="00:12:05.560" style="s2">few pro fun for headache if you need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.029" end="00:12:07.690" style="s2">sleeping those first few days extra is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.560" end="00:12:09.430" style="s2">valuable because even if we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.690" end="00:12:11.290" style="s2">about sleep almost all of us end up</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.430" end="00:12:13.720" style="s2">accumulating a little bits of sleep that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.290" end="00:12:16.570" style="s2">down again and sleep banking actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.720" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">does work to some degree so at least a</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.570" end="00:12:22.330" style="s2">week per quarter off now if someone has</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:24.640" style="s2">not been that for a long time so they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.330" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">been on their caffeine source regularly</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.640" end="00:12:30.550" style="s2">for years and especially if they have</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:32.680" style="s2">under slept in association with that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.550" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">especially if they have taken more than</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.680" end="00:12:36.070" style="s2">caffeine than they should be to begin</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:37.810" style="s2">with and they&#39;ve pin it down regulate</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.070" end="00:12:39.370" style="s2">their sensitivity they might need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.810" end="00:12:41.710" style="s2">come off for much longer than a week</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.370" end="00:12:44.350" style="s2">before they get to re-regulate</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.710" end="00:12:46.630" style="s2">adequately and move back to healthy</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.350" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">relationship to it and depending upon</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.630" end="00:12:51.940" style="s2">someone&#39;s caffeine metabolism which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:54.100" style="s2">you know largely genetic depending upon</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.940" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">the health of their adrenal glands and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.100" end="00:13:00.250" style="s2">their nervous system that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:13:03.459" style="s2">pretty huge variance but there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.250" end="00:13:07.260" style="s2">people who when they cycle off of pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.459" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">intensive caffeine usage are still</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:19.420" style="s2">for three months Wow for the time period</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.870" end="00:13:21.100" style="s2">that people are dealing with that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.420" end="00:13:21.670" style="s2">actually really important to not get</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.100" end="00:13:23.320" style="s2">back on</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.670" end="00:13:26.590" style="s2">caffeine because you really want your</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.320" end="00:13:30.430" style="s2">system to refined its homeostasis right</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.590" end="00:13:32.170" style="s2">to find its amino dynamics and there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.430" end="00:13:35.590" style="s2">things one can do to support themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.170" end="00:13:38.920" style="s2">they can try taking other kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.200" end="00:14:01.450" style="s2">easier and so bunam een and tyrosine</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.410" end="00:14:05.500" style="s2">together often can be utilized for that</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.660" end="00:14:20.710" style="s2">banking so when people are coming off of</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.710" end="00:14:24.190" style="s2">kind of stimulant for a long time taking</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.960" end="00:14:30.940" style="s2">twelve or sixteen hours a day can make a</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.360" end="00:14:40.990" style="s2">function increases damn well like I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.010" end="00:14:46.060" style="s2">telling you before I only took two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.990" end="00:14:48.850" style="s2">off about a month ago and as we were</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.060" end="00:14:52.690" style="s2">talking it sounds like my you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.850" end="00:14:55.630" style="s2">overused caffeine to a huge extent for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.690" end="00:14:58.600" style="s2">very long time and I probably have to go</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.630" end="00:15:00.790" style="s2">back in and take some more time off and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.600" end="00:15:03.820" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get any headaches whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.790" end="00:15:06.790" style="s2">but one of the worst things for me was I</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.820" end="00:15:09.370" style="s2">was just incredibly irritable like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.790" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">smallest things would would agitate me</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.370" end="00:15:14.290" style="s2">or stress me out I felt just this</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.310" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">enormous amount of pressure when nothing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.290" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">had changed other than I stopped</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:21.640" style="s2">drinking coffee it was it was a crazy</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:24.580" style="s2">feeling right yeah coming off of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.640" end="00:15:27.940" style="s2">caffeine is again it&#39;s going to be much</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.580" end="00:15:29.530" style="s2">harder for some people based on genetics</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.940" end="00:15:32.860" style="s2">and others much harder for some people</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.530" end="00:15:34.300" style="s2">based on how dependent they were on it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.860" end="00:15:35.320" style="s2">factoring all those things how long</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.300" end="00:15:37.930" style="s2">they&#39;ve been doing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.320" end="00:15:41.380" style="s2">they were doing adrenal exhaustion but</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.930" end="00:15:45.910" style="s2">in the cases where someone&#39;s dependence</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.380" end="00:15:48.190" style="s2">on it is stronger caffeine Informer is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.910" end="00:15:49.630" style="s2">good website and they give a good</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.130" end="00:16:01.210" style="s2">know is supportive of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.500" end="00:16:03.190" style="s2">understanding caffeine and the positives</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.210" end="00:16:04.630" style="s2">of it well when you read about the</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.630" end="00:16:09.970" style="s2">through withdrawals and come downs many</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.930" end="00:16:12.490" style="s2">of them sound a lot like people coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.970" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">off of stronger stimulants like meth in</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.490" end="00:16:17.530" style="s2">terms of experiencing irritability</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">anxiety and then worse even</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.530" end="00:16:23.350" style="s2">depersonalization D realization so and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:24.460" style="s2">just to kind of step back from chemo</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.350" end="00:16:28.750" style="s2">caffeine for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.460" end="00:16:31.060" style="s2">like even meth is a cool molecule it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.750" end="00:16:35.400" style="s2">one that again people regulate too so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.060" end="00:16:37.090" style="s2">quickly and it creates it creates</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.400" end="00:16:39.100" style="s2">override independence in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.090" end="00:16:40.510" style="s2">dopaminergic system so quickly and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.100" end="00:16:43.810" style="s2">many side effects I just really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.510" end="00:16:47.980" style="s2">recommend but no it was used so widely</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.810" end="00:16:50.220" style="s2">in in the you know 50 G&#39;s before we</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.980" end="00:16:54.070" style="s2">recognized all the issues of it and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.220" end="00:16:54.940" style="s2">adderall now is an impediment it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.070" end="00:16:56.380" style="s2">you know the only different</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.940" end="00:17:01.030" style="s2">methamphetamine and adderall is one</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.380" end="00:17:05.650" style="s2">methyl group but like all of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.030" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">things have the possibility of positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.650" end="00:17:14.740" style="s2">therapeutic application take exercise</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.630" end="00:17:16.689" style="s2">right people can exercise in ways where</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.740" end="00:17:18.220" style="s2">they exceed what their body should do</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.689" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">and they injure themselves rather than</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.220" end="00:17:26.560" style="s2">benefiting themselves and so pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:27.850" style="s2">anything even if it can be good for you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.560" end="00:17:30.940" style="s2">or really is good for you in most</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.850" end="00:17:33.340" style="s2">applications can also be used</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.940" end="00:17:35.560" style="s2">irresponsibly and the more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.340" end="00:17:37.060" style="s2">something is the more one has to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.560" end="00:17:38.800" style="s2">mindful and the less one has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.060" end="00:17:41.430" style="s2">mindful the higher the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.800" end="00:17:43.750" style="s2">there has been something responsible use</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.430" end="00:17:45.400" style="s2">right I love that perspective I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.750" end="00:17:47.500" style="s2">appreciate that I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.400" end="00:17:48.740" style="s2">give it another shot so what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.500" end="00:17:51.620" style="s2">dive into</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.740" end="00:17:54.440" style="s2">neuro hacking the company you own is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.620" end="00:17:57.320" style="s2">called neuro hacker collective and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.440" end="00:17:59.750" style="s2">think everyone out there has heard of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.320" end="00:18:02.809" style="s2">the term neuro hacking but I think there</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.750" end="00:18:05.330" style="s2">probably a lot of misunderstandings and</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.809" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">myths surrounding the word so first off</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.330" end="00:18:13.070" style="s2">can you just describe briefly what neuro</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:15.620" style="s2">hacking is so we&#39;ll describe the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.070" end="00:18:20.020" style="s2">that we think of it and kind of how we</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.620" end="00:18:20.020" style="s2">define it so neural hacking for us is</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.580" end="00:18:26.780" style="s2">utilizing any kinds of tools</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.050" end="00:18:30.830" style="s2">technologies processes they have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.780" end="00:18:33.320" style="s2">ability to up regulate some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.830" end="00:18:35.510" style="s2">brain or nervous system function or</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.320" end="00:18:37.940" style="s2">associated body function that then</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.510" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">affects brain or nervous system function</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.940" end="00:18:42.710" style="s2">largely for the purpose of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:45.140" style="s2">up regulate some aspect of cognitive or</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.710" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">emotional function we&#39;re specifically</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.140" end="00:18:48.620" style="s2">looking at the mind brain interface</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:51.650" style="s2">mostly now we could of course look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.620" end="00:18:56.600" style="s2">the brain just for its effect on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.650" end="00:18:59.030" style="s2">body like increased coordination and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.600" end="00:19:00.500" style="s2">know sentry systems motor systems and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.030" end="00:19:03.429" style="s2">that&#39;s also kind of in the periphery of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.500" end="00:19:06.800" style="s2">it we&#39;re largely looking at how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.429" end="00:19:08.690" style="s2">support the body to affect the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.800" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">emotions also can we do with mind and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.690" end="00:19:12.950" style="s2">emotions to affect the body and brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">and how do we kind of hack the mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.950" end="00:19:16.820" style="s2">brain interface for both better</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:19.130" style="s2">subjective experience and increased</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.820" end="00:19:24.170" style="s2">capacities and how do we do it in ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.130" end="00:19:27.410" style="s2">that are not just upregulating to some</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.170" end="00:19:30.140" style="s2">capacity in the moment but with side</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.410" end="00:19:32.150" style="s2">effects and down regulation of something</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.140" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">meaningful long-term but how do we do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.150" end="00:19:36.230" style="s2">in a way that is sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.750" style="s2">regenerative and we&#39;re actually more</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.230" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">focused on up regulating regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.750" end="00:19:43.130" style="s2">capacity itself rather than just up</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">regulating some particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.130" end="00:19:46.370" style="s2">stimulus in a way that might override</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:48.500" style="s2">the integrity of the system what do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.370" end="00:19:53.330" style="s2">mean can you explain that last bit a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.500" end="00:19:55.130" style="s2">little bit further sure so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.330" end="00:19:58.190" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about stimulants</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.130" end="00:20:00.890" style="s2">again stimulants are tools of neural</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.190" end="00:20:02.419" style="s2">hacking but most of them most of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.890" end="00:20:04.249" style="s2">don&#39;t fit it to what</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.419" end="00:20:07.669" style="s2">would consider good neural hacking tools</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.249" end="00:20:10.639" style="s2">so let&#39;s say we take adderall there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.669" end="00:20:12.139" style="s2">outside of its medical application there</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.639" end="00:20:15.859" style="s2">are many people who take adderall or</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.139" end="00:20:19.220" style="s2">other kinds of smart drugs stimulants to</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.859" end="00:20:21.259" style="s2">be able to launch their tech startup to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.220" end="00:20:22.879" style="s2">get to their taxes to do their midterms</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.259" end="00:20:24.529" style="s2">or finals whatever it is because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.879" end="00:20:28.220" style="s2">having a hard time focusing adequately</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.529" end="00:20:30.499" style="s2">and this is a helping them so adderall</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.220" end="00:20:33.139" style="s2">is primarily working on your dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.499" end="00:20:35.179" style="s2">system it&#39;s a presynaptic dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.139" end="00:20:37.429" style="s2">agonist so it&#39;s making your neurons</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.179" end="00:20:41.259" style="s2">produce more dopamine and dopamine is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.429" end="00:20:43.879" style="s2">involved in the ability to focus and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.259" end="00:20:45.759" style="s2">drive right so if you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.879" end="00:20:47.659" style="s2">something that is kind of easy to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.759" end="00:20:49.929" style="s2">procrastinate and get distracted from</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.659" end="00:20:54.499" style="s2">increased focus and Driver pretty great</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.929" end="00:20:56.749" style="s2">now how does the body naturally produce</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.499" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">and regulate dopamine right if we think</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.749" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">of what we call the endogenous</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.039" end="00:21:55.820" style="s2">in some art you might want dopamine to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.929" end="00:21:57.350" style="s2">drop a lot I want serotonin to come up</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.820" end="00:21:59.659" style="s2">right so your body is naturally</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.880" end="00:23:41.130" style="s2">being able to keep it elevated the</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:52.160" style="s2">way its processing dopamine changes so</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.100" end="00:23:53.690" style="s2">if dopamine starts being very high</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.160" end="00:23:56.220" style="s2">ongoingly</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.220" end="00:24:03.320" style="s2">the synapse then the body might start</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.020" end="00:24:05.250" style="s2">down regulating the dopamine receptor</p>

<p begin="00:24:05.250" end="00:24:09.090" style="s2">coming through and then if you get off</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:11.040" style="s2">of the adderall or meth or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.090" end="00:24:12.660" style="s2">is now the natural amount of dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.040" end="00:24:15.240" style="s2">you produce is less than it was before</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.660" end="00:24:16.980" style="s2">and your receptors are even less</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.240" end="00:24:18.090" style="s2">sensitive to dopamine because there was</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.980" end="00:24:19.500" style="s2">these higher amount now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.090" end="00:24:22.260" style="s2">experiencing this pretty terrible</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.500" end="00:24:25.620" style="s2">withdraw and crash and so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.260" end="00:24:29.130" style="s2">just give someone a state we want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.620" end="00:24:30.630" style="s2">support their own brain body mind</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.070" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">what we mean by up regulating the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.500" end="00:24:42.420" style="s2">regulatory capacity of the system rather</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">than overriding the regulatory capacity</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.420" end="00:24:48.210" style="s2">to just fix a specific state so</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:49.650" style="s2">something like adderall yes let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.210" end="00:24:53.000" style="s2">take adderall so something like adderall</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.650" end="00:24:56.040" style="s2">will will go in and produce a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.000" end="00:24:58.950" style="s2">basically fill the brain with dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.040" end="00:25:02.070" style="s2">release all of it at once and then leave</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.950" end="00:25:03.420" style="s2">it in worse shape than it was in in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.070" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">first place and what you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.420" end="00:25:10.140" style="s2">suggesting or what you what you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">working on is things that can leave the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.140" end="00:25:15.630" style="s2">brain and a better and better shape than</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:18.170" style="s2">when you found it yeah I mean when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.630" end="00:25:20.580" style="s2">think about I know your audience is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.170" end="00:25:21.780" style="s2">very connected to the CrossFit world and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.580" end="00:25:24.180" style="s2">if you think about the philosophy of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.780" end="00:25:26.280" style="s2">CrossFit world and the sense of general</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.180" end="00:25:29.160" style="s2">preparedness and general capability for</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.280" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">lots of different kinds of activity the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.160" end="00:25:32.910" style="s2">whole goal is increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:36.750" style="s2">adaptiveness of the being physically</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.910" end="00:25:39.120" style="s2">right that it is not someone that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.750" end="00:25:41.700" style="s2">just lift a lot of weight but can barely</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.120" end="00:25:44.010" style="s2">move or someone that could run fast but</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.700" end="00:25:46.710" style="s2">couldn&#39;t handle weight when it can come</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.010" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">or it&#39;s a sense of kind of how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.710" end="00:25:52.890" style="s2">make the being actually more responsive</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:56.060" style="s2">more adaptive increase the responsive</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.890" end="00:25:58.500" style="s2">capacity and so there&#39;s ways of both</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.060" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">stressing the system and then allowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.500" end="00:26:02.790" style="s2">it to repair and then stressing it in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:05.670" style="s2">different ways and so similarly with our</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.790" end="00:26:08.040" style="s2">own internal physiology with our immune</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.670" end="00:26:10.170" style="s2">system we want an immune system that can</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.040" end="00:26:13.590" style="s2">respond better to different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.170" end="00:26:14.910" style="s2">pathogens faster we want a repair system</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.590" end="00:26:16.200" style="s2">that can repair different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.910" end="00:26:18.450" style="s2">injury faster right we want a</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.200" end="00:26:21.360" style="s2">neurochemical system that when we want</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.450" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">to focus can go into intense focus but</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.360" end="00:26:25.320" style="s2">when we need to be able to move our</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:26.850" style="s2">focus between a lot of things task</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.320" end="00:26:29.640" style="s2">switching we can move it between a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.850" end="00:26:31.080" style="s2">of things without feeling stressed or</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.640" end="00:26:33.590" style="s2">irritated by something moving our</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.080" end="00:26:36.810" style="s2">attention so how do we increase our</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.590" end="00:26:39.030" style="s2">overall adaptiveness as a being now of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.810" end="00:26:41.340" style="s2">course neural hacking doesn&#39;t imply that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.030" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">a lot of like just if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.340" end="00:26:44.429" style="s2">anything that is changing the way the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:46.440" style="s2">nervous system operates for some</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.299" end="00:26:53.369" style="s2">steps to say the kind of neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.369" end="00:26:56.639" style="s2">we actually value and respect is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.369" end="00:26:59.759" style="s2">kind that went while it is enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.639" end="00:27:02.519" style="s2">some instantaneous capacity it is also</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.519" end="00:27:08.419" style="s2">minimum not damaging it love it I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.240" end="00:27:12.029" style="s2">a two-part question for you next so</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.419" end="00:27:15.059" style="s2">first off before before we get deeper</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.029" end="00:27:17.279" style="s2">into optimizing brain function what are</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.059" end="00:27:19.139" style="s2">what are some of the prerequisites that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:22.499" style="s2">people should be doing consistently</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.139" end="00:27:26.700" style="s2">before considering some of these neuro</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.499" end="00:27:29.970" style="s2">hacking supplementation these ways of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.700" end="00:27:32.999" style="s2">supplementing and if they are not</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.970" end="00:27:35.960" style="s2">meeting those prerequisites are things</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.999" end="00:27:37.889" style="s2">like nootropics neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.960" end="00:27:42.440" style="s2">supplementation it are they even</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.889" end="00:27:42.440" style="s2">beneficial mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.519" end="00:27:50.730" style="s2">and so with those prerequisites I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.490" end="00:27:54.269" style="s2">talking I&#39;m talking nutrition and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.730" end="00:27:55.889" style="s2">lifestyle mainly sure it&#39;s a nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.269" end="00:27:59.490" style="s2">question so I&#39;m going to answer it a</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.889" end="00:28:01.980" style="s2">couple ways this the first part is I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.490" end="00:28:03.480" style="s2">would say to the degree that someone can</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.980" end="00:28:07.169" style="s2">have the foundational aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.480" end="00:28:09.179" style="s2">lifestyle be with it it&#39;s not first and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.169" end="00:28:12.149" style="s2">then any kind of enhancement be what</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.179" end="00:28:16.110" style="s2">they built off that foundation that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.149" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">good rule of thumb and so if someone for</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.110" end="00:28:21.720" style="s2">instance isn&#39;t sleeping well either they</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:24.659" style="s2">aren&#39;t getting dropping into deep Delta</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.720" end="00:28:25.139" style="s2">sleep or they aren&#39;t getting enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.659" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">sleep</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.139" end="00:28:34.830" style="s2">then a the starts taking immune support</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:37.230" style="s2">of herbs well most of the immune repair</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.830" end="00:28:38.820" style="s2">only happens at night when sleeping and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.230" end="00:28:40.860" style="s2">sharing Delta sleep if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.820" end="00:28:42.990" style="s2">getting enough Delta sleep those are</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.860" end="00:28:44.369" style="s2">just not going to do that much if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.990" end="00:28:48.299" style="s2">taking things that are going to support</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.369" end="00:28:51.869" style="s2">a tissue synthesis most of the tissue</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.299" end="00:28:53.159" style="s2">repair happens during Delta sleep if</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.869" end="00:28:55.980" style="s2">you&#39;re taking the topics that are going</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.159" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">to support things like memory memory</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.980" end="00:28:58.590" style="s2">consolidation happens during Delta sleep</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:00.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.590" end="00:29:04.049" style="s2">some aspects happen during SATA sleep</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.360" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">and so you&#39;re going to get a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.049" end="00:29:06.809" style="s2">tiny fraction of anything that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:08.340" style="s2">taking that&#39;s going to help your</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.809" end="00:29:10.190" style="s2">regenerative capacity if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.340" end="00:29:13.169" style="s2">doing the foundational thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.190" end="00:29:15.630" style="s2">where regeneration occurs we can also</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.169" end="00:29:16.890" style="s2">look at diet and say alright say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.630" end="00:29:19.890" style="s2">going to take some supplements and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.890" end="00:29:23.909" style="s2">take even if I take a handful of pills a</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.890" end="00:29:26.460" style="s2">day I&#39;m still talking about a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.909" end="00:29:27.779" style="s2">tiny amount of grams in comparison to</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.460" end="00:29:31.440" style="s2">the total amount of food I eat per day</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.779" end="00:29:35.429" style="s2">and all of that food is chemistry that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.440" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">is not just macros that are competing my</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.429" end="00:29:39.870" style="s2">body fat muscle composition but they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:41.370" style="s2">all of the microbes that are affecting</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.870" end="00:29:42.750" style="s2">what my brain is made out of what my</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.370" end="00:29:44.450" style="s2">hormones are made out of what all my</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.750" end="00:29:48.510" style="s2">tissues are made out of themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.450" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">so all of that food is either medicine</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.510" end="00:29:56.159" style="s2">or toxicity or somewhere on that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:58.649" style="s2">spectrum and so if somebody is taking in</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.159" end="00:30:01.409" style="s2">food that is not providing adequate</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.649" end="00:30:03.990" style="s2">nutrition and especially if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.409" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">providing toxicity and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.990" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">going to try and just override that by</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:10.169" style="s2">taking supplements it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.510" style="s2">taking caffeine instead of sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.169" end="00:30:14.460" style="s2">right it&#39;s just so the reason that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.510" end="00:30:19.289" style="s2">word supplement is used as it means in</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.460" end="00:30:22.409" style="s2">addition to right so if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.289" end="00:30:24.120" style="s2">maybe I think most people in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.409" end="00:30:26.460" style="s2">podcast will pray be familiar with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.120" end="00:30:29.130" style="s2">if you think about the way that like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.460" end="00:30:31.500" style="s2">turbocharger or supercharger added to an</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.130" end="00:30:33.890" style="s2">engine moves more oxygen through the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.500" end="00:30:35.789" style="s2">engine so you can get more combustion a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.890" end="00:30:38.460" style="s2">turbocharger without an engine doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.789" end="00:30:40.830" style="s2">do anything at all right innately an</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.460" end="00:30:43.500" style="s2">engine without a turbocharger still does</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.830" end="00:30:46.590" style="s2">a lot and so if you think of the engine</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.500" end="00:30:48.510" style="s2">as lifestyle and you think about all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.590" end="00:30:50.549" style="s2">kind of hacking as like adding a badass</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.510" end="00:30:52.529" style="s2">turbocharger there&#39;s no question it can</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.549" end="00:30:54.299" style="s2">make you go a lot faster but it has to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.529" end="00:30:58.200" style="s2">be on top of foundation otherwise it</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.299" end="00:30:59.940" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t work that well so now</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.200" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the main thing I would say</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.940" end="00:31:02.909" style="s2">into the foundations everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:04.409" style="s2">what the foundations are nobody likes to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.909" end="00:31:05.700" style="s2">hear about them because they&#39;re hard and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.409" end="00:31:08.030" style="s2">we don&#39;t really like doing them and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.700" end="00:31:11.970" style="s2">want like new shit</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.030" end="00:31:17.430" style="s2">but I&#39;m going to put to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.970" end="00:31:22.050" style="s2">sleep exercise movement food diet</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.430" end="00:31:26.520" style="s2">nutrition stress management reduction</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.050" end="00:31:32.940" style="s2">and you know those kinds of categories</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.520" end="00:31:34.890" style="s2">uh we can get into more things that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.940" end="00:31:36.120" style="s2">could fit in there but let&#39;s just let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.890" end="00:31:40.260" style="s2">just call those kind of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.120" end="00:31:44.420" style="s2">foundational categories I&#39;m going to put</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.260" end="00:31:47.820" style="s2">sleep in its own category and say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.420" end="00:31:50.820" style="s2">if someone is having even the tiniest</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.820" end="00:31:52.440" style="s2">bit of sleep deficit it has a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.820" end="00:31:55.620" style="s2">negative effect on their whole system</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.440" end="00:31:58.170" style="s2">that a little bit of poor nutrition or a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.620" end="00:32:01.320" style="s2">little bit of inadequacy and exercise</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.170" end="00:32:04.470" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t have got it interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.320" end="00:32:08.310" style="s2">so as I mean we know that exercise</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.470" end="00:32:10.680" style="s2">affects the genetic transcription</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.310" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">pattern of thousands of genes that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.680" end="00:32:14.220" style="s2">huge fucking deal it&#39;s like our genome</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:15.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter that much genetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.220" end="00:32:17.100" style="s2">transcription matters because if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.930" end="00:32:20.700" style="s2">have a gene that&#39;s kind of sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.100" end="00:32:23.250" style="s2">quiet even if it does code for elevated</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.700" end="00:32:25.080" style="s2">homocysteine or whatever it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.250" end="00:32:27.720" style="s2">matter right it only matters if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.080" end="00:32:31.020" style="s2">actually coding those those proteins are</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.720" end="00:32:33.240" style="s2">being built so you can change what is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.020" end="00:32:35.880" style="s2">actually expressing genetically from</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.240" end="00:32:37.590" style="s2">lifestyle factors and so exercise you</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.880" end="00:32:38.970" style="s2">know profoundly if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.590" end="00:32:41.280" style="s2">looking at being able to affect</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.970" end="00:32:44.250" style="s2">thousands of genes that&#39;s a huge deal</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.280" end="00:32:47.250" style="s2">it&#39;s affecting exercise can up regulate</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.250" end="00:32:49.650" style="s2">BDNF which is brain derived neurotrophic</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.890" end="00:33:05.550" style="s2">list of all things exercise can do and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.190" end="00:33:07.590" style="s2">its effects on decreasing depression and</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.780" end="00:33:16.430" style="s2">than that in the same a diet when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.430" end="00:33:20.850" style="s2">think about all the negative effects of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.430" end="00:33:23.130" style="s2">excessive sugar of so many kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.210" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">nothing like all of these categories are</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.220" end="00:33:38.309" style="s2">foundational if you get really great</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:42.750" style="s2">sleep but eat shitty you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.309" end="00:33:44.700" style="s2">problems if you get you know really</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.750" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">great exercise need shitty you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.700" end="00:33:48.390" style="s2">problems like there none of them replace</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:50.549" style="s2">the other ones but you will get more</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.390" end="00:33:52.140" style="s2">profound problems faster from sleep</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.549" end="00:33:55.740" style="s2">issues than any of the other ones so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.140" end="00:33:58.200" style="s2">really do think and it&#39;s such an easy</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.020" end="00:34:05.190" style="s2">in this a lot of shit we want to do and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.750" end="00:34:06.660" style="s2">it&#39;s so easy to have this like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.190" end="00:34:09.840" style="s2">sleep when I&#39;m dead so give me more</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.660" end="00:34:11.639" style="s2">caffeine like I want to do stuff one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.840" end="00:34:13.669" style="s2">the things that is fascinating to me is</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.639" end="00:34:18.119" style="s2">in the sleep deprivation studies as</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.669" end="00:34:21.540" style="s2">someone is in moving into deeper degrees</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.119" end="00:34:22.530" style="s2">of sleep deprivation in time so what one</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.540" end="00:34:24.149" style="s2">thing that&#39;s very interesting say</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.530" end="00:34:27.090" style="s2">someone naturally wakes after 8 hours</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.149" end="00:34:28.619" style="s2">sleep and so instead they set their</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.090" end="00:34:30.359" style="s2">alarm and they were going to get to bed</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.619" end="00:34:32.310" style="s2">on time but they like check one last</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.359" end="00:34:33.899" style="s2">email or did one thing so they now they</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.310" end="00:34:35.250" style="s2">just got seven and a half hours sleep</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.899" end="00:34:36.570" style="s2">that still seems like a lot a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.250" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">people when you get sick 7 a half I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.570" end="00:34:43.590" style="s2">pretty good but it&#39;s actually a half</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">hour sleep debt if you add that up times</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.590" end="00:34:49.050" style="s2">a lot of nights right it doesn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:51.240" style="s2">that very doesn&#39;t take very long for it</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.050" end="00:34:52.560" style="s2">to be missing a whole night of sleep and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.240" end="00:34:54.690" style="s2">you think about how someone feels in</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.560" end="00:34:57.149" style="s2">that case and then missing weeks of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.690" end="00:35:01.500" style="s2">sleep reading as it goes on time that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.149" end="00:35:03.050" style="s2">really happens and so we&#39;ll notice that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.500" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">some of the symptoms are things like</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.050" end="00:35:07.800" style="s2">verbal fluency and word recall if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:09.330" style="s2">looking for a word or you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.800" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">a name it&#39;s kind of on the tip of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.330" end="00:35:13.350" style="s2">tongue but it takes a minute to find it</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:16.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty classic sign of sleep</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.350" end="00:35:19.800" style="s2">debt and that shouldn&#39;t be that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.080" end="00:35:21.420" style="s2">just like aging or being human or having</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.800" end="00:35:23.720" style="s2">a high IQ that&#39;s actually a sign that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.420" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">your brain is not functioning that well</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.720" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">and it can be from different reasons but</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:31.710" style="s2">it&#39;s most commonly asleep that if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:35.130" style="s2">just completely fucking forgot where you</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.710" end="00:35:36.990" style="s2">parked or where you put your keys or</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.130" end="00:35:39.000" style="s2">your phone or what you were doing last</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.990" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">or you know something like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.000" end="00:35:41.690" style="s2">so you&#39;re short</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:44.569" style="s2">memory has that level of capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.690" end="00:35:46.900" style="s2">impairment that&#39;s that&#39;s not normal</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.569" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a sign of dysfunction</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.900" end="00:35:51.109" style="s2">and the most common reason for it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:54.410" style="s2">sleep now it can be for other reasons it</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.109" end="00:35:56.450" style="s2">can be new nutrition deficiency it can</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.410" end="00:36:00.020" style="s2">be stress overload it can be exposure to</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.450" end="00:36:01.549" style="s2">toxins neurotoxins mold etc but sleeps</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.020" end="00:36:04.339" style="s2">the most common one and sleep helps with</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.549" end="00:36:05.420" style="s2">all those other things so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.339" end="00:36:07.940" style="s2">interesting things though is that as</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.420" end="00:36:10.579" style="s2">someone is moving into sleep debt at</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.940" end="00:36:11.930" style="s2">first they notice it and they go oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.579" end="00:36:13.490" style="s2">a little bit tired if they had been</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.930" end="00:36:16.579" style="s2">sleeping well and then they&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.490" end="00:36:19.069" style="s2">I&#39;m getting more tired but as someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.579" end="00:36:20.750" style="s2">gets deeper into sleep debt they stop</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.069" end="00:36:23.930" style="s2">recognizing that they&#39;re getting deeper</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.750" end="00:36:25.910" style="s2">into sleep debt and so there is actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.930" end="00:36:29.030" style="s2">a mismatch between someone&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.910" end="00:36:31.130" style="s2">self-assessment of how much sleep debt</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.030" end="00:36:33.140" style="s2">is there and how much like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.130" end="00:36:34.760" style="s2">actually there it&#39;s very much like drunk</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.140" end="00:36:36.380" style="s2">people who can&#39;t recognize how drunk</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.760" end="00:36:39.650" style="s2">they are because their brain is Mis</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.380" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">assessing it the tired brain is Mis</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.650" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">assessing this also from just an</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:46.119" style="s2">evolutionary adaptation right like think</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:48.200" style="s2">about mothers who have an infant baby</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.119" end="00:36:50.059" style="s2">they&#39;re just not going to get enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.200" end="00:36:51.950" style="s2">sleep for a while right unless unless</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.059" end="00:36:54.109" style="s2">they just have one of those magical</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.950" end="00:36:55.700" style="s2">babies that sleeps all night long and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.109" end="00:36:58.010" style="s2">they have a husband that does a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.700" end="00:36:59.089" style="s2">maybe a nanny in a community they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.010" end="00:37:01.849" style="s2">going to go through a period of sleep</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.089" end="00:37:03.500" style="s2">that and so to be aware of how much they</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.849" end="00:37:05.150" style="s2">were in sleep that would just suck so</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.500" end="00:37:06.859" style="s2">they just kind of be there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.150" end="00:37:10.040" style="s2">evolutionary adaptation to be less aware</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.859" end="00:37:12.619" style="s2">of it but the problem of course is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.040" end="00:37:16.010" style="s2">we can then exploit that lack of</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.619" end="00:37:18.260" style="s2">awareness to keep going and so most</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.010" end="00:37:20.930" style="s2">people will have a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.260" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">they&#39;re like say only operating at</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.930" end="00:37:24.109" style="s2">seventy percent of capacity but they</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:26.030" style="s2">only but they think they&#39;re operating at</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.109" end="00:37:27.859" style="s2">ninety percent of capacity and that miss</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.030" end="00:37:32.059" style="s2">assessment is actually the court with</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.859" end="00:37:33.829" style="s2">the cause of a lot of problems so when</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.059" end="00:37:35.780" style="s2">you were asking about foundations I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.829" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">really do put sleep in its own category</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.780" end="00:37:43.880" style="s2">and then next I&#39;m going to put nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:47.510" style="s2">and what people are taking in their</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.880" end="00:37:49.220" style="s2">mouth I&#39;m going to put movement I want</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.510" end="00:37:52.609" style="s2">you know exercise will be a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.220" end="00:37:53.180" style="s2">that and I&#39;ll put the relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.609" end="00:37:54.920" style="s2">stress</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.180" end="00:37:56.690" style="s2">which is going to have to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.920" end="00:37:58.220" style="s2">relationships in their life the nature</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.690" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">of their work the way they create</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.220" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">meaning how they&#39;ve processed old trauma</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:04.039" style="s2">whether they give themselves time to</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:06.920" style="s2">meditate journal etc do things to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.039" end="00:38:09.559" style="s2">process it now then we can put other</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.920" end="00:38:11.299" style="s2">categories like someone&#39;s home</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.559" end="00:38:13.279" style="s2">environment that&#39;s kind of a big deal if</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.299" end="00:38:14.510" style="s2">they live in a house that say has mold</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.279" end="00:38:16.700" style="s2">in it or they live in an environment</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.510" end="00:38:18.319" style="s2">that&#39;s actually dangerous so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.700" end="00:38:20.270" style="s2">stressed out all the time or dealing</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.319" end="00:38:22.660" style="s2">with physical stressors or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.270" end="00:38:24.770" style="s2">around people who are either</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.660" end="00:38:26.029" style="s2">particularly negative or have lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.770" end="00:38:28.609" style="s2">habits that influence them in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.029" end="00:38:31.039" style="s2">direction so environment people and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.609" end="00:38:33.500" style="s2">physical environment can really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.039" end="00:38:35.539" style="s2">be are you another foundational category</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.500" end="00:38:37.220" style="s2">tell you what let&#39;s let&#39;s stop it right</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.539" end="00:38:39.289" style="s2">there I want to pull on a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.220" end="00:38:42.099" style="s2">those categories and yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.289" end="00:38:45.190" style="s2">realizing that we could have a four-hour</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.099" end="00:38:47.180" style="s2">conversation and not not get through</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.190" end="00:38:48.559" style="s2">everything I wanted to get through so</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.180" end="00:38:50.089" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to I&#39;m just going to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.559" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">down a couple of these different avenues</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.089" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">first off the the that miss assessment</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:57.650" style="s2">is absolutely fascinating because one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:39:00.109" style="s2">the things I was going to bring up is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.650" end="00:39:02.599" style="s2">that so many people they think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.109" end="00:39:05.900" style="s2">operating at a hundred percent and when</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.599" end="00:39:07.819" style="s2">you you know when you suggest a couple</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.900" end="00:39:12.410" style="s2">things whether it be you know nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.819" end="00:39:13.849" style="s2">or sleep advice they they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.410" end="00:39:15.640" style="s2">see the point because they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.849" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">they are operating at a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.640" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">um I&#39;m curious what are are there any</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:25.609" style="s2">like kind of biggest bang for your buck</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:31.160" style="s2">type interventions or changes that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.609" end="00:39:33.859" style="s2">think most or all people should make all</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.160" end="00:39:36.559" style="s2">is obviously not not going to work but</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.859" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">most people are deficient in and need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.559" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">change in their diet and their diet yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:50.180" style="s2">this is a lot of things and it is there</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.950" end="00:39:51.770" style="s2">are some things that are true across the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.180" end="00:39:52.760" style="s2">board and there&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.770" end="00:39:54.140" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be different for</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.760" end="00:39:59.029" style="s2">different goals and different</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.140" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">physiologies you had asked me previously</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.029" end="00:40:04.250" style="s2">a question about a diet that focuses</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">mostly only on macros and being flexible</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.250" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.060" end="00:40:14.330" style="s2">if someone is focused on their physique</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.480" end="00:40:18.410" style="s2">and so they want to make sure that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.330" end="00:40:20.180" style="s2">are you know burning more calories than</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.410" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">they are consuming in a day or consuming</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.180" end="00:40:23.510" style="s2">just enough of their big growing muscle</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:26.240" style="s2">so they&#39;re really kind of macro focused</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.510" end="00:40:28.190" style="s2">and being more flexible with which</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:29.900" style="s2">macros which foods they can get their</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.190" end="00:40:31.640" style="s2">macros from so they can actually sustain</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.900" end="00:40:36.920" style="s2">that for a while we totally get why that</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.640" end="00:40:38.090" style="s2">diet evolved and it is grossly under</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.920" end="00:40:40.810" style="s2">aware of lots of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.090" end="00:40:43.340" style="s2">relevant other than just like short-term</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.340" end="00:40:48.230" style="s2">that right right and so I mean I correct</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.070" end="00:40:49.970" style="s2">me if I&#39;m wrong but I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.230" end="00:40:52.490" style="s2">you might mean is like most people that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.970" end="00:40:56.690" style="s2">follow that kind of diet are uninformed</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.490" end="00:40:57.380" style="s2">on the importance of micronutrients so a</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.690" end="00:40:59.630" style="s2">few things</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.380" end="00:41:01.460" style="s2">micros micronutrients is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.630" end="00:41:03.740" style="s2">first thing about that diet that is also</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.460" end="00:41:07.310" style="s2">several other things welcome to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.740" end="00:41:10.100" style="s2">could you potentially follow that kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.310" end="00:41:15.140" style="s2">of diet but also keep in mind all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.100" end="00:41:18.920" style="s2">your micronutrients kind of okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.140" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">going to keep going so macros are you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.920" end="00:41:25.850" style="s2">know where you get calories from right</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:28.460" style="s2">protein fat carbs and someone this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.850" end="00:41:31.070" style="s2">the normal definition but someone can</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.460" end="00:41:33.140" style="s2">also kind of think of water and fiber as</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.070" end="00:41:34.280" style="s2">macros they&#39;re not caloric sources but</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:38.270" style="s2">they&#39;re things you need a lot of each</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.280" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">day right but then your micronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.270" end="00:41:43.880" style="s2">are your vitamins fat soluble water</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">soluble vitamins your minerals your</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.880" end="00:41:48.130" style="s2">macro minerals and your trace minerals</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.440" end="00:41:50.810" style="s2">and then all the phytochemicals and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.130" end="00:41:54.350" style="s2">polyphenols and enzymes and etc that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.810" end="00:41:59.270" style="s2">come from a natural diet and a wide</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.350" end="00:42:01.570" style="s2">variety of natural foods you could say</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.270" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">well can&#39;t I just take a multivitamin</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.570" end="00:42:06.680" style="s2">multi-mineral and not kind of worry</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:09.110" style="s2">about that I would say that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.680" end="00:42:13.430" style="s2">than not doing it and a far away from</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.110" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">actually having a evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.430" end="00:42:20.630" style="s2">relevant diet because the form of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:23.180" style="s2">nutrients from</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.630" end="00:42:25.820" style="s2">natural sources let&#39;s just say from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.180" end="00:42:31.070" style="s2">plant source it could be plant or animal</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.820" end="00:42:33.530" style="s2">source you&#39;ll have a plant that has a</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.070" end="00:42:35.690" style="s2">mineral that is bound in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.530" end="00:42:38.330" style="s2">different forms so you know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.690" end="00:42:41.020" style="s2">just going to be dealing with say salary</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.330" end="00:42:43.790" style="s2">you&#39;ll have you&#39;ll have sodium as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.020" end="00:42:48.290" style="s2">little bit of sodium chloride and sodium</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.790" end="00:42:50.060" style="s2">bicarb and sodium by phosphate and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.290" end="00:42:53.240" style="s2">know many different forms you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.060" end="00:42:55.310" style="s2">you take a magnesium supplement and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.240" end="00:42:57.410" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s magnesium citrate the body</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.310" end="00:42:59.990" style="s2">has give or take 13 different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.410" end="00:43:01.850" style="s2">magnesium that we know of that utilizes</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.990" end="00:43:04.940" style="s2">and very differently in different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.850" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">of tissues so magnesium for brain health</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.940" end="00:43:10.370" style="s2">versus magnesium for its kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:11.950" style="s2">electrolyte properties or in muscles or</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.370" end="00:43:14.810" style="s2">heart or adrenals different forms</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.950" end="00:43:17.360" style="s2">natural foods do a better job of giving</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.810" end="00:43:20.530" style="s2">you a wider variety of those things also</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.360" end="00:43:22.730" style="s2">often times with cofactors some of which</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.530" end="00:43:23.960" style="s2">won&#39;t be in the multi some of which we</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.730" end="00:43:27.860" style="s2">don&#39;t even understand that well that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.960" end="00:43:29.480" style="s2">will affect absorption and then things</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.860" end="00:43:33.770" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even usually think of as</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.480" end="00:43:38.060" style="s2">micros like all of the antioxidants and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.770" end="00:43:43.880" style="s2">all the polyphenols all of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.060" end="00:43:45.770" style="s2">plant-based enzymes etc so those matter</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.880" end="00:43:49.310" style="s2">a lot and what we know about life</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.770" end="00:43:51.320" style="s2">extension right now kind of the best</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.310" end="00:43:53.500" style="s2">thing we still know about life extension</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.320" end="00:43:56.420" style="s2">we know you know quite a few things is</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.500" end="00:43:58.700" style="s2">caloric restriction is meaningful for</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.420" end="00:44:02.540" style="s2">life extension in all mammals including</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.700" end="00:44:04.850" style="s2">humans and but when we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.540" end="00:44:06.380" style="s2">people from Blue Zones who have who</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.850" end="00:44:08.110" style="s2">lived the oldest the areas where you</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.380" end="00:44:10.820" style="s2">have the most people that live over 100</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.110" end="00:44:12.140" style="s2">there their diets can be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.820" end="00:44:15.650" style="s2">different but one of the commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.140" end="00:44:17.930" style="s2">is that there they are in general taking</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.650" end="00:44:20.780" style="s2">in less calories than we are there in</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.930" end="00:44:22.940" style="s2">slight caloric deficit but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.780" end="00:44:26.180" style="s2">taking their calories from micronutrient</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.940" end="00:44:28.220" style="s2">rich sources so their diet is lower in</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.180" end="00:44:33.170" style="s2">macronutrients higher and micronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.220" end="00:44:34.010" style="s2">which means they you know are in caloric</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.170" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">restriction</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.010" end="00:44:39.980" style="s2">being a nutrient restriction interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:46.070" style="s2">got it which is the exact opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.980" end="00:44:51.890" style="s2">empty carbs right so this is why getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.070" end="00:44:55.940" style="s2">food from organic biodynamic local</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.890" end="00:44:59.600" style="s2">seasonal rotating whole food etc sources</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.940" end="00:45:04.520" style="s2">actually makes a big difference as all</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.600" end="00:45:07.190" style="s2">of those other compounds now that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.520" end="00:45:10.700" style="s2">thing right is that actually getting the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.190" end="00:45:13.670" style="s2">good things from food love it macros is</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.700" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">really important one on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.670" end="00:45:18.500" style="s2">not getting bad things from food is also</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:21.500" style="s2">really important and not getting bad</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.500" end="00:45:25.400" style="s2">things from food means inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.500" end="00:45:26.930" style="s2">compounds so if and this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.400" end="00:45:29.780" style="s2">a little bit the same for everyone and a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.930" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">little bit different most people will</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.780" end="00:45:33.859" style="s2">have inflammatory reactions or have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:35.869" style="s2">probability of having inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.859" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">reactions from a lot of common things so</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.869" end="00:45:44.030" style="s2">pasteurized dairy hybridized grains</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:46.130" style="s2">excessive sugar etc those are all going</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.030" end="00:45:48.730" style="s2">to be probably inflammatory for most</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.130" end="00:45:51.440" style="s2">people and you&#39;re not just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.730" end="00:45:54.170" style="s2">inflammation in the joint you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.440" end="00:45:56.619" style="s2">about internal inflammation throughout</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.170" end="00:46:00.859" style="s2">like systemic throughout the body right</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.619" end="00:46:03.260" style="s2">yes starting in the gut and then having</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.859" end="00:46:07.580" style="s2">systemic effects that originate in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.260" end="00:46:11.150" style="s2">gut and other are there is there</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.580" end="00:46:16.100" style="s2">anything any kind of identifying markers</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.150" end="00:46:20.320" style="s2">that people can look for it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.100" end="00:46:20.320" style="s2">rather than than just going to a lab</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.400" end="00:46:26.930" style="s2">uh-oh I thought you were asking lab</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.050" end="00:46:33.619" style="s2">markers that&#39;s okay too yeah yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.930" end="00:46:36.530" style="s2">easiest the easiest first so again this</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.619" end="00:46:38.390" style="s2">is tricky because there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.530" end="00:46:40.670" style="s2">different inflammatory markers and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.390" end="00:46:41.590" style="s2">different ones show up first for</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.670" end="00:46:44.300" style="s2">different people</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.590" end="00:46:47.109" style="s2">so the inflammatory markers that in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.300" end="00:46:51.980" style="s2">normal non-functional medicine doc will</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.109" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">most commonly run is the run CRP and sed</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.980" end="00:46:56.150" style="s2">rate and maybe homocysteine and those</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:57.560" style="s2">are primarily kind of cardiac</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.150" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">inflammatory markers that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.560" end="00:47:02.090" style="s2">predispositions for heart disease there</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:04.310" style="s2">are plenty of people that actually have</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.090" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">full-blown inflammatory diseases where</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.310" end="00:47:11.270" style="s2">none of those are elevated they we might</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:12.859" style="s2">see calprotectin elevated showing</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.270" end="00:47:14.450" style="s2">inflammation in the bowels and we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.859" end="00:47:16.850" style="s2">have kind of inflammatory bowel disease</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.450" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">without any about the heart and plummet</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.850" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">or markers we can see specific cytokines</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:25.190" style="s2">that are elevated that are going to lead</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:27.230" style="s2">to autoimmune diseases like lupus</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.190" end="00:47:32.119" style="s2">rheumatoid arthritis or pebble miles or</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.230" end="00:47:38.119" style="s2">PMR so and then there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.119" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">have like elevated histamine maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.119" end="00:47:43.340" style="s2">genetically that leads to inflammation</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">you&#39;d have to kind of specifically look</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.340" end="00:47:48.440" style="s2">at that including neuro inflammation or</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:50.440" style="s2">who have leptin sensitivity which you</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.440" end="00:47:53.450" style="s2">can see through different markers like</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.440" end="00:47:57.980" style="s2">like Adina pectin which lead to</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.450" end="00:47:59.900" style="s2">sensitivity to lectin rich foods so one</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.980" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">thing I would say here is for people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.900" end="00:48:05.330" style="s2">are interested in optimizing health</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:08.330" style="s2">going to work with a good functional</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.330" end="00:48:10.310" style="s2">medicine doctor who can kind of take in</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.330" end="00:48:13.010" style="s2">their symptoms take in their goals and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.310" end="00:48:14.930" style="s2">then prioritize labs with them and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.010" end="00:48:18.770" style="s2">create customized protocols highly</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.930" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">recommended think about this think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.770" end="00:48:23.780" style="s2">all the times you heard about someone</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:26.750" style="s2">who got some intense headache went to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.780" end="00:48:28.280" style="s2">the doctor had a brain scan found out</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.750" end="00:48:29.720" style="s2">they had a pretty serious brain tumor</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.280" end="00:48:32.359" style="s2">and they got diagnosed a few months left</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.600" end="00:50:53.780" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly there&#39;s certainly some</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.950" end="00:50:56.359" style="s2">things you can look for so functional</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.780" end="00:51:00.140" style="s2">medicine is a specific branded thing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.359" end="00:51:00.859" style="s2">Institute of functional medicine is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.140" end="00:51:02.029" style="s2">has very</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.859" end="00:51:03.859" style="s2">training&#39;s and some of the better</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.029" end="00:51:05.900" style="s2">trainings that are kind of standardized</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.859" end="00:51:07.940" style="s2">right now you can also look at just</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.900" end="00:51:12.589" style="s2">people who call themselves naturopathic</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.940" end="00:51:15.460" style="s2">doctors and integrative doctors and just</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.589" end="00:51:17.559" style="s2">kind of see if what they are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.460" end="00:51:20.900" style="s2">relevant for what your interests are</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.559" end="00:51:23.089" style="s2">obviously if you have some GI issues</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.900" end="00:51:25.789" style="s2">having a integrative or functional</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.089" end="00:51:27.019" style="s2">doctor who has some GI specialty or if</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.789" end="00:51:28.849" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to build a lot of muscle</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.019" end="00:51:30.739" style="s2">have one that is good at Ormond</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.849" end="00:51:32.539" style="s2">optimization right you want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.739" end="00:51:34.730" style="s2">whatever your goals are someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.539" end="00:51:40.430" style="s2">some specialization and experience with</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.730" end="00:51:42.410" style="s2">those topics and then right now the best</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.430" end="00:51:43.670" style="s2">you can probably do is check out reviews</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.410" end="00:51:48.680" style="s2">and then go meet them and see if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.670" end="00:51:52.039" style="s2">resonate done so originally I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.680" end="00:51:54.170" style="s2">really dive into you know nootropics and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.039" end="00:51:57.410" style="s2">different neuro hacking techniques as</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.170" end="00:51:59.029" style="s2">well as longevity but it you know for</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.410" end="00:52:01.460" style="s2">the for most of this conversations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.029" end="00:52:03.769" style="s2">been kind of like what are the what are</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.460" end="00:52:06.650" style="s2">the precursors people need to have down</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.769" end="00:52:08.299" style="s2">before they consider that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.650" end="00:52:10.819" style="s2">which i think is a great starting place</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.299" end="00:52:14.299" style="s2">so before before we wrap up I know</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.819" end="00:52:17.329" style="s2">people are going to have a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.299" end="00:52:21.019" style="s2">questions about the nutrition piece what</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.329" end="00:52:22.970" style="s2">are one two or three resources that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.019" end="00:52:26.569" style="s2">would recommend people go to that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.970" end="00:52:29.390" style="s2">you know widely varied and also</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.569" end="00:52:31.819" style="s2">digestible for for laypeople in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.390" end="00:52:34.020" style="s2">micronutrients and and that kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.819" end="00:52:35.269" style="s2">sort of thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.020" end="00:52:39.349" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.269" end="00:52:45.589" style="s2">I think nutrition is actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.349" end="00:52:49.849" style="s2">trickiest topics there is so much vested</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.589" end="00:52:52.670" style="s2">interest and people who have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.849" end="00:52:55.249" style="s2">authored books and just hold to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.670" end="00:52:58.509" style="s2">particular ideology of the kind of food</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.249" end="00:53:01.069" style="s2">people want to eat of the associated</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.509" end="00:53:03.619" style="s2">morality and ethics and lifestyle and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.069" end="00:53:08.359" style="s2">culture elements that there are very few</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.619" end="00:53:11.989" style="s2">topics that are less coherent across the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.359" end="00:53:13.849" style="s2">whole field than this one medicine does</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.989" end="00:53:14.630" style="s2">not like within the field of Integrative</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.849" end="00:53:17.180" style="s2">Medicine there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.630" end="00:53:19.460" style="s2">as much intense difference as there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.180" end="00:53:20.839" style="s2">in foundational nutrition similarly</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.460" end="00:53:25.670" style="s2">there&#39;s not that much difference in in</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.839" end="00:53:32.329" style="s2">thought on sleep so I mean a classic</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.670" end="00:53:35.089" style="s2">example is people who are in the you</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.329" end="00:53:36.440" style="s2">know more raw food and more vegan and</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.089" end="00:53:38.450" style="s2">more kind of calorie restriction</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.440" end="00:53:43.220" style="s2">direction and then people who are in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.450" end="00:53:46.250" style="s2">more ketogenic diet primal diet paleo</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.220" end="00:53:49.730" style="s2">direction they both reference a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.250" end="00:53:51.650" style="s2">well done science right and there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.730" end="00:53:54.470" style="s2">really good scientists and doctors on</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.650" end="00:53:56.029" style="s2">both sides of that and they both look at</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.470" end="00:54:00.829" style="s2">blue zone studies but in very different</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.029" end="00:54:02.000" style="s2">ways some of it&#39;s because it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.829" end="00:54:03.559" style="s2">be different for different peoples</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.000" end="00:54:10.279" style="s2">genetics for different peoples</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.559" end="00:54:12.140" style="s2">physiology how they approach it etc so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.279" end="00:54:16.450" style="s2">would say there are general rules of</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.140" end="00:54:20.420" style="s2">thumb to say one should eat closer to</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.450" end="00:54:23.180" style="s2">the living ecosystem is a generally good</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.420" end="00:54:26.599" style="s2">rule of thumb meaning the more processed</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.180" end="00:54:29.240" style="s2">and packaged hybridized sprayed etc</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.599" end="00:54:31.130" style="s2">something is the worse it is in general</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.240" end="00:54:34.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not an absolute truth but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.130" end="00:54:37.130" style="s2">general truth and closer to things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.250" end="00:54:39.170" style="s2">have been what our bodies evolved to eat</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.130" end="00:54:42.740" style="s2">over very long periods of time and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.170" end="00:54:44.180" style="s2">particularly also with less pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.740" end="00:54:47.089" style="s2">and herbicides and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.180" end="00:54:49.190" style="s2">designed to kill life on them and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.089" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">more they come from healthy soils rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.190" end="00:54:53.660" style="s2">than pretty demineralized soils and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:54:56.450" style="s2">fresher they are versus they&#39;ve been out</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.660" end="00:54:58.309" style="s2">of the ground for pretty long time these</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.450" end="00:55:03.730" style="s2">are all you know in to the degree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.309" end="00:55:06.259" style="s2">meats then grass-fed free-range etc</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.730" end="00:55:08.299" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of important across the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.259" end="00:55:10.220" style="s2">board whether you&#39;re eating meats or not</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.299" end="00:55:12.259" style="s2">or these ones are not or nitrates or not</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.220" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">like kind of dial that and second dial</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.259" end="00:55:16.759" style="s2">in this general approach to things that</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:19.700" style="s2">would have been part of a living</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.759" end="00:55:21.529" style="s2">ecosystem first and I would say then the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.700" end="00:55:25.069" style="s2">next good rule of thumb is paying</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.529" end="00:55:27.109" style="s2">attention to how you feel as pretty</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.069" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">closely as you eat different things so</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.109" end="00:55:33.079" style="s2">pay attention right after</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:34.369" style="s2">miel do you have a sense of over</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.079" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">fullness in your belly like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.369" end="00:55:37.849" style="s2">having a hard time digesting it do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.839" end="00:55:40.640" style="s2">have GI symptoms afterwards you get</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.849" end="00:55:42.950" style="s2">tired after eating in do you get hungry</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.640" end="00:55:45.950" style="s2">again right away do you have energy for</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.950" end="00:55:47.779" style="s2">a while though do you sleep well</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.950" end="00:55:49.819" style="s2">afterwards the more you can do kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.779" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">really attentive quantified self</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.819" end="00:55:55.010" style="s2">assessment just even spend a few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:55.819" style="s2">and journal what you&#39;re eating and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.010" end="00:55:58.819" style="s2">journal how you&#39;re feeling in</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.819" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">association and dial it in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.819" end="00:56:04.369" style="s2">combination of the general rule of thumb</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.319" end="00:56:06.380" style="s2">of eating evolutionarily relevant foods</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.369" end="00:56:08.210" style="s2">and paying attention to which ones feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.380" end="00:56:11.180" style="s2">good for you that would be foundational</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.210" end="00:56:14.930" style="s2">then study specific diets on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.180" end="00:56:16.819" style="s2">and then do actual functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.930" end="00:56:19.099" style="s2">where you look at your nutrient levels</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.819" end="00:56:21.589" style="s2">and your you know food allergies etc on</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.099" end="00:56:24.410" style="s2">top of that in terms of resources to go</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.589" end="00:56:26.150" style="s2">study more the reason why I was hesitant</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.410" end="00:56:28.250" style="s2">to say the resources is they mostly all</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.150" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">fall into camps that are very different</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.250" end="00:56:35.390" style="s2">than other camps so have good things to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:36.980" style="s2">say so I think Dave asked freeze nubuck</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.390" end="00:56:39.710" style="s2">headstrong is one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.980" end="00:56:42.770" style="s2">introductions to health for people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.710" end="00:56:47.599" style="s2">have not got into it yet that I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.770" end="00:56:49.760" style="s2">of I think it is a you know people take</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.599" end="00:56:51.109" style="s2">different through lines of how they</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.760" end="00:56:53.180" style="s2">write a book like that whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.109" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">under any healthy fats or whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.180" end="00:56:56.690" style="s2">on the same caloric restriction the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:56:59.569" style="s2">through line he took was cellular health</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.690" end="00:57:01.730" style="s2">mitochondrial energy and brain that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.569" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">great through line and so then he looked</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.730" end="00:57:06.710" style="s2">at diet and exercise and sleep and</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:10.430" style="s2">toxicity and hacking techniques in light</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.710" end="00:57:12.010" style="s2">of that and you know I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.430" end="00:57:14.690" style="s2">what he has in the book is really</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.010" end="00:57:16.099" style="s2">foundationally great it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.690" end="00:57:17.660" style="s2">be appropriate for everyone people will</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.099" end="00:57:23.420" style="s2">want to modify but I think it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.660" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">starting place in terms of other people</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.420" end="00:57:31.010" style="s2">that have a similar issue philosophy a</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:34.309" style="s2">lot of what dr. Mercola writes on diet</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.010" end="00:57:38.990" style="s2">is kind of similar and again clinically</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.309" end="00:57:41.660" style="s2">well backed up if you go speak to a</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.990" end="00:57:42.370" style="s2">normal cardiologist they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.660" end="00:57:44.950" style="s2">looking at pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.370" end="00:57:46.570" style="s2">Ken&#39;s work on extremely low fat diets</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.950" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">having lower heart disease living longer</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.570" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">and more Mediterranean diet I think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">is largely just older research but but</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:59.410" style="s2">not irrelevant and I have seen people do</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:58:01.480" style="s2">blueproof diet ketogenic diet a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.410" end="00:58:05.410" style="s2">bit wrongly and have their lipid profile</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.480" end="00:58:07.750" style="s2">gets super whacked and so there is some</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.410" end="00:58:11.470" style="s2">need for nuance and I actually think a</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.750" end="00:58:15.160" style="s2">lot of the raw food vegan communities</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.470" end="00:58:16.840" style="s2">has good things to say on diet even if</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.160" end="00:58:19.060" style="s2">you decide not to be vegan you decide to</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.840" end="00:58:22.090" style="s2">eat some other you know animal products</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.060" end="00:58:25.420" style="s2">with it a lot of the insights on soil</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.090" end="00:58:26.980" style="s2">conditions and micronutrients and plants</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.420" end="00:58:30.490" style="s2">and therapeutic use of herbs and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.980" end="00:58:31.870" style="s2">whatever there is great so those are a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.490" end="00:58:34.240" style="s2">few that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.870" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">I appreciate that so it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.240" end="00:58:40.900" style="s2">there is no perfect diet like one size</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:42.940" style="s2">fits all which is kind of a you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.900" end="00:58:45.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the case in just about</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.940" end="00:58:47.710" style="s2">everything in life right there are rules</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.880" end="00:58:49.510" style="s2">of thumb there are generalized</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.710" end="00:58:52.780" style="s2">principles and then there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.510" end="00:58:56.590" style="s2">room for adaptation like what someone</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.780" end="00:58:59.890" style="s2">should eat if they are training heavily</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.590" end="00:59:01.420" style="s2">versus not and training for powerlifting</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.890" end="00:59:04.330" style="s2">versus ultramarathons</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.420" end="00:59:06.580" style="s2">and you know based on their genetics and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.330" end="00:59:07.870" style="s2">age and what kind of medical conditions</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.580" end="00:59:11.940" style="s2">they have that&#39;s all going to just be so</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.870" end="00:59:16.450" style="s2">so different one thing I will also say</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.940" end="00:59:20.880" style="s2">is be the idea that someone should not</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.450" end="00:59:22.930" style="s2">do kind of more advanced neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.880" end="00:59:24.760" style="s2">biohacking things if they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.930" end="00:59:26.290" style="s2">foundations down this is not totally</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.760" end="00:59:27.820" style="s2">correct I wanted to take that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.290" end="00:59:31.660" style="s2">perspective first because I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.820" end="00:59:34.270" style="s2">emphasize foundations but say we look at</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.660" end="00:59:37.420" style="s2">either use of no tropics or you said EEG</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.270" end="00:59:42.310" style="s2">neurofeedback or different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.420" end="00:59:44.590" style="s2">sleep tech sometimes even if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.310" end="00:59:46.890" style="s2">foundations are screwed they&#39;re screwed</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.590" end="00:59:48.850" style="s2">enough that the person&#39;s behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.890" end="00:59:50.530" style="s2">chemistry is out of whack enough that</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.850" end="00:59:51.880" style="s2">they just can&#39;t fix it it can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.530" end="00:59:54.940" style="s2">get themselves to eat better exercise</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.880" end="00:59:55.990" style="s2">well you know sleep well regularly</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.940" end="00:59:58.030" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.990" end="01:00:01.060" style="s2">and sometimes those interventions</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.030" end="01:00:03.100" style="s2">actually help the person enough that not</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.060" end="01:00:04.810" style="s2">only do they get the benefit of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.100" end="01:00:06.970" style="s2">intervention but it helps them get the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.810" end="01:00:09.550" style="s2">Foundation&#39;s down better to change their</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.970" end="01:00:12.400" style="s2">behavior right absolutely so like one of</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.550" end="01:00:15.250" style="s2">the things that you know we have found</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.400" end="01:00:19.869" style="s2">with you know with quality and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.250" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">nootropics is if people are having</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.869" end="01:00:23.800" style="s2">issues with sleep if their underslept or</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:26.350" style="s2">if they have kind of overuse stimulants</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.800" end="01:00:28.780" style="s2">they might need to fix that first</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.350" end="01:00:32.950" style="s2">but otherwise if say their diet is poor</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.780" end="01:00:38.800" style="s2">or their exercises poor it&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.950" end="01:00:40.570" style="s2">common that people will start I mean not</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.800" end="01:00:42.340" style="s2">all know perfectly the same quality</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.570" end="01:00:44.920" style="s2">specifically has a lot that balances</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.340" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">that dopamine opioid access so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.920" end="01:00:51.850" style="s2">actually helping work on the chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:54.340" style="s2">systems of motivation and behavior</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.850" end="01:00:56.650" style="s2">themselves we&#39;ve had a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.340" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">just couldn&#39;t get themselves to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.650" end="01:01:02.050" style="s2">regular with exercise and diet they got</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:03.970" style="s2">on that and then they actually were so</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.050" end="01:01:06.130" style="s2">the general rule of thumb is someone</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.970" end="01:01:07.630" style="s2">does want to be focused on Foundations</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.130" end="01:01:10.090" style="s2">but if they&#39;re having a really hard time</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.630" end="01:01:12.850" style="s2">focusing with foundations finding tools</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.090" end="01:01:14.530" style="s2">that can not support them to keep not</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.850" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">doing foundations and things that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.530" end="01:01:17.859" style="s2">can just augment it but things that can</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">actually help them with the behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.859" end="01:01:23.020" style="s2">dynamics of doing the foundation will</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:25.300" style="s2">work that can be super useful that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.020" end="01:01:29.680" style="s2">great perspective I love that even if it</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.300" end="01:01:32.590" style="s2">even if it is a placebo that gets them</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.680" end="01:01:34.300" style="s2">to change the behavior then the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.590" end="01:01:36.160" style="s2">important part is that they are changing</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.300" end="01:01:38.260" style="s2">their behavior which oftentimes is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.160" end="01:01:42.609" style="s2">most important piece so the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.260" end="01:01:44.410" style="s2">what you guys do is so holistic and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.609" end="01:01:46.210" style="s2">know has such a long term effects is</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.410" end="01:01:49.300" style="s2">just that much better I love it</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.210" end="01:01:52.090" style="s2">yeah and you know sometimes sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.300" end="01:01:54.210" style="s2">therapy actually can the right kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.090" end="01:01:58.390" style="s2">therapy can really help someone change</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.210" end="01:02:02.380" style="s2">patterns underneath their behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.390" end="01:02:05.830" style="s2">like neurofeedback can help neuro</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.380" end="01:02:07.660" style="s2">regulatory patterns that can make a huge</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.830" end="01:02:09.730" style="s2">difference to just someone state of</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.660" end="01:02:11.859" style="s2">health and well-being overall stress</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.730" end="01:02:14.080" style="s2">assessing but also then how people react</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.859" end="01:02:18.280" style="s2">to stress and go into addictive patterns</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.080" end="01:02:19.869" style="s2">so we can say both sides means they get</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.280" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">foundations first and then two advanced</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.869" end="01:02:23.859" style="s2">techniques we can also say if the</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:25.600" style="s2">advanced techniques can help you be able</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.859" end="01:02:26.980" style="s2">to do a better job of foundations that</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.600" end="01:02:28.180" style="s2">you&#39;ve had this new year&#39;s goals every</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.980" end="01:02:29.830" style="s2">year and not actually been able to</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.180" end="01:02:31.780" style="s2">stabilize don&#39;t keep trying and failing</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.830" end="01:02:34.420" style="s2">it the same thing see if additional</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.780" end="01:02:39.130" style="s2">tools can support you right I love that</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.420" end="01:02:41.050" style="s2">so look I am really dying to continue</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.130" end="01:02:43.960" style="s2">this conversation we&#39;ve opened so many</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.050" end="01:02:46.240" style="s2">doors but we&#39;re going to have to save</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.960" end="01:02:47.830" style="s2">some of it for the next time what what</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.240" end="01:02:49.300" style="s2">do you have what do you want to leave</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.830" end="01:02:57.820" style="s2">these listeners with or do you have an</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.300" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">ask of them I enjoyed the time with you</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.820" end="01:03:03.940" style="s2">and I&#39;m looking forward to the next time</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:05.650" style="s2">and if this was interesting and people</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.940" end="01:03:07.210" style="s2">have questions on other topics my ass</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.650" end="01:03:08.800" style="s2">would be they just tell you what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.210" end="01:03:12.460" style="s2">interested in that we talk about next</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.800" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">time and other than that my ask would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.460" end="01:03:21.100" style="s2">that they take more responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:23.920" style="s2">their own health and well-being in life</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.100" end="01:03:25.600" style="s2">and they did previously and that means</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.920" end="01:03:27.130" style="s2">study more so they can actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.600" end="01:03:29.619" style="s2">understand how to support themselves</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.130" end="01:03:31.359" style="s2">because that will put them not just in</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.619" end="01:03:33.220" style="s2">the best position for their own health</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.359" end="01:03:34.510" style="s2">but also in the best position to help</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.220" end="01:03:37.119" style="s2">other people and be an asset in the</p>

<p begin="01:03:38.920" end="01:03:45.220" style="s2">few behavioural changes and then do some</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.210" end="01:03:49.000" style="s2">more self experimentation with quality</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.220" end="01:03:50.950" style="s2">myself and then once that is taking</p>
