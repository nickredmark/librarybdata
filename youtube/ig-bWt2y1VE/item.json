    "description": "This week on the Brute Strength Podcast I’ll be interviewing cofounder, director of research and development, and systems designer for The Nuerohacker Collective, Daniel Schmachtenberger. Daniel has background in systems science, social engineering and human behavior. His most current research involves integrative medicine and neurotech tools to optimize the mind/brain interface. We dive into nootropics, their use, and lifestyle perquisites. We also talk about the importance of sleep cycles, nutrition effects, neuro chemistry and structure, and neurotransmitters such as dopamine.
