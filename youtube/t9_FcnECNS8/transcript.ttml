<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">go and check that out and the other is</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:22.600" style="s2">into some some shared collective and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.290" end="00:02:24.310" style="s2">obviously in the contemplative</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.240" end="00:02:36.760" style="s2">this and i think ken wilber way back</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:39.820" style="s2">when made a great distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.760" end="00:02:42.070" style="s2">when we move from the rational norm</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.820" end="00:02:44.890" style="s2">which for us in the post enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.070" end="00:02:46.780" style="s2">west is basically the atomized rational</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.890" end="00:02:49.090" style="s2">individual so when we move into</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.780" end="00:02:51.900" style="s2">communitas there&#39;s a question of is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.090" end="00:02:55.030" style="s2">a progression or a regression and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.900" end="00:02:58.750" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s turn was the pre trans fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.030" end="00:03:02.709" style="s2">right don&#39;t mistake regression right</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.750" end="00:03:05.980" style="s2">into a pre conventional communitas cult</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.510" end="00:07:45.190" style="s2">ago for me in graduate school where I</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.980" end="00:07:46.990" style="s2">just was fascinated with millenarian and</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:16.510" style="s2">reference points we had were to go back</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.110" end="00:08:18.460" style="s2">to the beats in the late 50s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.510" end="00:08:20.590" style="s2">counterculture of the 60s and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.460" end="00:08:22.480" style="s2">this was the last place you know this</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.590" end="00:08:24.490" style="s2">this thread was before it went</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.480" end="00:08:26.830" style="s2">underground so I felt a little bit it</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.490" end="00:08:30.010" style="s2">was a little bit like our generation was</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.830" end="00:08:32.169" style="s2">almost like you know Zeppelin and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.010" end="00:08:33.490" style="s2">Beatles and you know and Pink Floyd and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.169" end="00:08:36.820" style="s2">those guys with the British rock</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.490" end="00:08:39.880" style="s2">invasion where they went and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.820" end="00:08:41.890" style="s2">studied assiduously Robert Johnson and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.880" end="00:08:44.169" style="s2">Mississippi Delta blues and Muddy Waters</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.890" end="00:08:46.329" style="s2">and Howlin wolf and Chicago Blue</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.169" end="00:08:48.279" style="s2">they kind of they they fetishized it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.329" end="00:08:50.200" style="s2">we&#39;re American pop culture it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.279" end="00:08:51.790" style="s2">moved on and forgotten it all and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.200" end="00:08:52.450" style="s2">the Brits were like that&#39;s just that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.790" end="00:08:54.220" style="s2">gold</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.450" end="00:08:55.810" style="s2">you know let&#39;s really go back and look</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.220" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">at it and bring it back to life</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.810" end="00:09:00.550" style="s2">and reinterpret it so we kind of had to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">because it was just such a such a bleak</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.550" end="00:09:05.320" style="s2">landscape for our generation</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:07.779" style="s2">my sense is is what&#39;s happening with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.320" end="00:09:10.300" style="s2">millennial generation is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.779" end="00:09:11.980" style="s2">and some of this is you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.300" end="00:09:13.149" style="s2">this is just classic family dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.980" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">kind of stuff but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.149" end="00:09:18.699" style="s2">nothing more boring or more you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:20.860" style="s2">whether you&#39;ve contempt than what your</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.699" end="00:09:23.829" style="s2">parents did when they were your age and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.860" end="00:09:25.209" style="s2">so my sense is is that the offspring you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.829" end="00:09:28.180" style="s2">know not the Boomers but the Echo</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.209" end="00:09:30.760" style="s2">Boomers the Millennials right are a law</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.180" end="00:09:32.889" style="s2">and massive and rising generation all</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.760" end="00:09:38.230" style="s2">sorts of cultural influences but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.889" end="00:09:40.120" style="s2">are remarkably unaware of the lessons</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.230" end="00:09:42.339" style="s2">learned of the hippie generation and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.120" end="00:09:44.829" style="s2">counterculture and so my sense was is</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.339" end="00:09:46.930" style="s2">that you know again going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.829" end="00:09:48.850" style="s2">the dynamics talked about a stealing</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:51.370" style="s2">fire which was ex Tarsus like peak</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.850" end="00:09:54.130" style="s2">experiences they tend to go hand in</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.130" end="00:09:58.149" style="s2">breakthroughs and the moment you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.870" end="00:10:00.279" style="s2">that dialectic you know standing up on</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.720" end="00:10:12.130" style="s2">well that&#39;s the social part so it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.419" end="00:12:41.470" style="s2">where we got Adi DAF who is more</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.730" end="00:12:43.149" style="s2">challenging and problematic because he</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.470" end="00:12:44.889" style="s2">actually did also like people up</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.149" end="00:12:47.470" style="s2">I think Manson is fair to say was just a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.889" end="00:12:50.919" style="s2"> psychopath right but Adi da was</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.470" end="00:12:52.869" style="s2">a bent realizer you know and those are</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.919" end="00:12:56.379" style="s2">comes osho too you know those are more</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.869" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">sort of crazy wisdom magi with issues</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.379" end="00:13:01.029" style="s2">where the other two were just whack nuts</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:01.640" style="s2">but nonetheless right that&#39;s the general</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.029" end="00:13:03.890" style="s2">neck of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.640" end="00:13:06.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.890" end="00:13:09.050" style="s2">when we think of the word cult so in</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.920" end="00:13:11.360" style="s2">some respects want to reclaim the term</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.050" end="00:13:13.790" style="s2">and the next question is what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.360" end="00:13:15.589" style="s2">now right because you know we can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.790" end="00:13:17.269" style="s2">back to ancient traditional stuff those</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.589" end="00:13:19.459" style="s2">those lineages are all broken and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.269" end="00:13:22.190" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t submit to that level of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.459" end="00:13:23.300" style="s2">compliance the cult II cults speak for</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.190" end="00:13:25.250" style="s2">themselves and clearly don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.300" end="00:13:26.540" style="s2">repeat those experiments but what is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.250" end="00:13:28.430" style="s2">realm for ethical cults</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.540" end="00:13:31.010" style="s2">what is the realm for a place where you</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.430" end="00:13:33.620" style="s2">no longer subjugate the self at all in</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.010" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">fact you actually valorize and support</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.620" end="00:13:39.829" style="s2">individual serenity but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:42.290" style="s2">create space for collective coherence</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.829" end="00:13:45.410" style="s2">and that arguably is our project these</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.290" end="00:13:48.890" style="s2">days right how do we harness ecstasy you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.410" end="00:13:52.070" style="s2">know and healthy catharsis for vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.890" end="00:13:55.670" style="s2">right self authoring and I collectively</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.670" end="00:13:58.850" style="s2">about you know and that&#39;s nice and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.500" end="00:14:03.050" style="s2">seems interesting and let&#39;s go do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.850" end="00:14:05.540" style="s2">right but to my point about you know</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:33.410" style="s2">think of a little bit like that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.250" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">Disney film Fantasia that classic right</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.410" end="00:14:37.699" style="s2">where Mickey is The Sorcerer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:40.040" style="s2">Apprentice right and the magician the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.699" end="00:14:42.410" style="s2">actual mage the one who knows magic</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.040" end="00:14:43.310" style="s2">leaves and Mickey&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.410" end="00:14:45.019" style="s2">anything that looks good</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.310" end="00:14:46.970" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna put on that point you hat with</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.019" end="00:14:49.790" style="s2">the stars on it I&#39;m gonna grab the wand</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.970" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna use magic to do all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.790" end="00:14:53.480" style="s2">dirty work I don&#39;t feel like doing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:55.670" style="s2">then obviously hell to pay</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.480" end="00:14:57.170" style="s2">right Faustian bargain 101 you know just</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.670" end="00:14:59.449" style="s2">just with with the Disney Mickey is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.170" end="00:15:02.449" style="s2">attached and so I think we&#39;re seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.449" end="00:15:04.220" style="s2">lot of that we&#39;re seeing a lot of false</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.449" end="00:15:06.110" style="s2">light we&#39;re seeing a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.220" end="00:15:08.750" style="s2">taking the claim that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.110" end="00:15:11.780" style="s2">actually ready for a condition for</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.750" end="00:15:14.570" style="s2">and that in conjunction with not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.780" end="00:15:17.780" style="s2">the prior generations is creating a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.570" end="00:15:21.170" style="s2">resurgence of bucket number two cult</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.780" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">occultic tendencies so now yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.170" end="00:15:24.890" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:27.830" style="s2">articulate perhaps a checklist for folks</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.890" end="00:15:29.630" style="s2">because the ideas is any communities of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.830" end="00:15:30.920" style="s2">practice we&#39;re diving into and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.630" end="00:15:34.310" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a list of some that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.920" end="00:15:36.620" style="s2">been tracking and paying attention to we</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.310" end="00:15:37.310" style="s2">are at risk of giving away our</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.620" end="00:15:40.010" style="s2">sovereignity</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.310" end="00:15:42.950" style="s2">in service of the power and the potency</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.010" end="00:15:44.600" style="s2">of some of these experiences and as we</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.950" end="00:15:46.400" style="s2">give up our sovereignty we often lose</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.600" end="00:15:49.460" style="s2">our discernment our just common sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.400" end="00:15:54.010" style="s2">and judgment and we can end up in places</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.460" end="00:15:57.650" style="s2">you know that are not safe not positive</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.010" end="00:16:00.470" style="s2">wildly problematic and can take years to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.650" end="00:16:02.570" style="s2">recover from if at all so hopefully this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.470" end="00:16:06.260" style="s2">is just a little bit if we&#39;re taking a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.570" end="00:16:08.780" style="s2">stand right for individual serenity part</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.260" end="00:16:11.390" style="s2">of that is cognitive literacy I actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.780" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on on on route</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.390" end="00:16:17.860" style="s2">to cognitive liberty therefore no one</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:20.780" style="s2">can can claim space between my ears</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.860" end="00:16:22.010" style="s2">without my consent and so hopefully this</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.780" end="00:16:24.650" style="s2">checklist is just a little bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.010" end="00:16:27.950" style="s2">inoculation that you know folks can use</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.650" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">and the idea here is like hey we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.950" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">mandate any other right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:34.089" style="s2">particularly the nature of peak</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:36.440" style="s2">experiences that they are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.089" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">antinomian right they do not subject to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.440" end="00:16:41.780" style="s2">hierarchical top-down control and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:43.640" style="s2">is both their greatest promise and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.780" end="00:16:45.320" style="s2">greatest challenge because the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.640" end="00:16:47.780" style="s2">promise is hey this is how we subvert</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.320" end="00:16:50.839" style="s2">the dominant paradigm yeah the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.780" end="00:16:53.690" style="s2">butBut the narcissistic reactionary one</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.839" end="00:16:55.400" style="s2">is you&#39;re not the boss of me okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.690" end="00:16:58.550" style="s2">how do we strike that balance so my</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.400" end="00:17:01.450" style="s2">sense is is that ideally we would have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.550" end="00:17:03.770" style="s2">code of conduct for ethical culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.450" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">right and it&#39;s obviously opt-in and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.770" end="00:17:08.329" style="s2">elective but so is the UN right and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:10.130" style="s2">could be that idea saying hey if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.329" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2">want to follow these best practices and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.130" end="00:17:13.459" style="s2">isn&#39;t this is just a rough first draft I</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:15.070" style="s2">mean who knows we can come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.459" end="00:17:16.390" style="s2">thousand others and they will hydrate</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.070" end="00:17:19.420" style="s2">every time but let&#39;s just use this as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.390" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">test-case and say hey I&#39;m like the UN</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.420" end="00:17:23.470" style="s2">you can up not to be in the UN you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:26.140" style="s2">be North Korea or Iran if you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.470" end="00:17:29.320" style="s2">in the UN you agree to free and fair</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.140" end="00:17:30.970" style="s2">elections you agree to open markets you</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.320" end="00:17:33.040" style="s2">agree to civil liberties in the</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.490" end="00:17:52.330" style="s2">another option would be sort of you know</p>

<p begin="00:17:56.800" end="00:18:01.630" style="s2">been exploring um but you will run the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.010" end="00:18:03.970" style="s2">risk of having your bond rating</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.630" end="00:18:06.220" style="s2">downgraded from triple-a to junk and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.970" end="00:18:07.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not that junk means you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.220" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">to play you still have a right to exist</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.720" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">but it just means that only the</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.820" end="00:18:19.390" style="s2">there is a signal in the marketplace and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.650" end="00:18:21.580" style="s2">in this case the marketplace of idea is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.390" end="00:18:24.010" style="s2">the marketplace of culture that lets</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.180" end="00:18:33.610" style="s2">and this was just 20 years of you know</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.500" end="00:19:19.450" style="s2">one I&#39;ll just lay out the three and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.170" end="00:19:21.910" style="s2">we can unpack them in detail there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.450" end="00:19:24.510" style="s2">three subsets to each so the first one</p>

<p begin="00:19:24.510" end="00:19:29.900" style="s2">the One Ring of Power and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.330" end="00:19:32.490" style="s2">probably the most central and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.900" end="00:19:34.679" style="s2">non-negotiable one so if we use you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.490" end="00:19:36.510" style="s2">the the Lord of the Rings as the example</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.679" end="00:19:38.100" style="s2">and you know obviously the One Ring is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.510" end="00:19:41.190" style="s2">the one that the hobbits gackt carrier</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.100" end="00:19:45.570" style="s2">and the Gollum had it is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.190" end="00:19:46.860" style="s2">potent it conveys godlike power and the</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.210" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">where that they&#39;re climbing up the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.350" end="00:20:09.059" style="s2">snow-capped peak and and Frodo drops the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:10.919" style="s2">ring and Boromir picks it up and as he</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.059" end="00:20:12.419" style="s2">picks it up and he&#39;s going to give it</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.919" end="00:20:14.790" style="s2">back to Frodo but he kind of hesitates</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.790" end="00:20:18.780" style="s2">ring race and they sort of all gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:21.000" style="s2">freaky deaky and he and you can see and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.780" end="00:20:24.840" style="s2">he&#39;s struggling with but I could do so</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.000" end="00:20:28.140" style="s2">much good with this right and he is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.840" end="00:20:30.510" style="s2">being bent towards grabbing the ring the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.140" end="00:20:33.450" style="s2">same happens with Saruman Saruman the</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.710" end="00:25:15.100" style="s2">that&#39;s potentially some of the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.030" end="00:25:18.490" style="s2">so the advocacy is either don&#39;t grab the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.100" end="00:25:20.830" style="s2">ring have the fellowship and or as</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.490" end="00:25:23.680" style="s2">opposed to the Luciferian principle the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.830" end="00:25:26.410" style="s2">grabbing and the claim is to embody the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.680" end="00:25:29.530" style="s2">more Christic archetype which is my</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.410" end="00:25:32.560" style="s2">humanity is is connected to my divinity</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.530" end="00:25:35.080" style="s2">they are not separable and and it is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.560" end="00:25:37.990" style="s2">combination of those two that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.080" end="00:25:42.340" style="s2">something really durable and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.990" end="00:25:44.620" style="s2">worthwhile so then the next one is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.340" end="00:25:47.500" style="s2">idea of creating in and out groups so</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.620" end="00:25:50.140" style="s2">anytime there is a separation of who we</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.500" end="00:25:53.280" style="s2">are versus the rest that is massively</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.140" end="00:25:56.590" style="s2">problematic and and the third is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.280" end="00:25:58.780" style="s2">weaponizing of peak experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.590" end="00:25:59.370" style="s2">healing so we can kind of go back and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.780" end="00:26:01.559" style="s2">kind of on</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.370" end="00:26:04.550" style="s2">pack these one-by-one yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.559" end="00:26:06.660" style="s2">you&#39;ve got some really good solid</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.550" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">examples within all of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.660" end="00:26:10.860" style="s2">headings yeah yeah so you know just just</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">to kind of go back I mean the first one</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.860" end="00:26:13.980" style="s2">is is there&#39;s a lot of meat on that bone</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:16.020" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of worth it one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.980" end="00:26:17.490" style="s2">first things to notice is in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.020" end="00:26:19.020" style="s2">grabbing of the one ring we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.490" end="00:26:20.430" style="s2">the accepting of kind of the golden</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.020" end="00:26:22.620" style="s2">shadow of the followers versus</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.430" end="00:26:25.920" style="s2">constantly giving it back saying no you</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.620" end="00:26:27.660" style="s2">are that - right own it don&#39;t don&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.920" end="00:26:30.120" style="s2">it to me don&#39;t give it away all right</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.660" end="00:26:31.950" style="s2">hold it and but and live into that all</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.120" end="00:26:33.809" style="s2">right the first one which is a dead</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.950" end="00:26:35.850" style="s2">giveaway is a mythologized</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.809" end="00:26:38.370" style="s2">origin story of the founder this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.850" end="00:26:40.350" style="s2">either prodigious birth the childhood</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.370" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">signs of talent whatever it is is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.350" end="00:26:44.850" style="s2">they are somehow have been set apart</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:47.010" style="s2">from way back when for greatness</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.850" end="00:26:49.530" style="s2">it can also another variation is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.010" end="00:26:52.170" style="s2">profound conversion experience and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.530" end="00:26:53.850" style="s2">has become a trope in info marketing you</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.170" end="00:26:55.110" style="s2">know I was making tons of money I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.850" end="00:26:56.730" style="s2">doing such and such and then a car</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.110" end="00:26:58.710" style="s2">accident or something and I woke up in</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.730" end="00:27:00.750" style="s2">my hospital bed and I realized you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.710" end="00:27:03.210" style="s2">now my mission in life is to sell</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.750" end="00:27:05.490" style="s2">to other people right that is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.210" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">current perversion of it but it exists</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.490" end="00:27:08.520" style="s2">you know the ancient you what ancient</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">yeah I suppose ancient is the you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.520" end="00:27:13.380" style="s2">Saul on the road to Damascus right I</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:15.450" style="s2">once was lost but now I&#39;m found was</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.380" end="00:27:18.120" style="s2">blind but now I see I was a heroin</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.450" end="00:27:19.470" style="s2">junkie crackhead dealer and now I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.120" end="00:27:22.100" style="s2">to bring you the good news whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.470" end="00:27:23.340" style="s2">is right so there&#39;s some highly stylized</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.100" end="00:27:25.350" style="s2">mythologized</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.340" end="00:27:27.300" style="s2">origin story that sets that person apart</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.350" end="00:27:27.870" style="s2">as if they were marked for destiny and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.300" end="00:27:31.050" style="s2">greatness</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.870" end="00:27:35.820" style="s2">the next is absolutist claims of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.050" end="00:27:37.830" style="s2">attainment so I am 100% awake and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.820" end="00:27:39.929" style="s2">lightened fill in the blank whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.830" end="00:27:41.850" style="s2">their descriptive categories are and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.929" end="00:27:43.740" style="s2">key there and this this is you know that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.850" end="00:27:48.530" style="s2">Lucifer principle was another</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.740" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">articulation of this if that&#39;s true then</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.530" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">everything that happens in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:57.540" style="s2">to me is now no longer mutual or</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:28:00.570" style="s2">interests subjective because I&#39;m perfect</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.540" end="00:28:01.920" style="s2">and this is an absolute attainment it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.570" end="00:28:05.580" style="s2">happened back when it&#39;s usually rolled</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.920" end="00:28:08.010" style="s2">into my mythologized origin story I am</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.580" end="00:28:11.310" style="s2">not subject to human to human critique</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.010" end="00:28:13.049" style="s2">so if you&#39;ve got a problem with me all</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.310" end="00:28:14.789" style="s2">right that must be your shadow</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.049" end="00:28:18.840" style="s2">it must be your projection it&#39;s your</p>

<p begin="00:28:26.369" end="00:28:33.539" style="s2">ahh dee da chucked me into a bonfire in</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.019" end="00:28:34.049" style="s2">a fit of seeming rage but it woke me the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.539" end="00:28:36.869" style="s2"> up</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.049" end="00:28:38.669" style="s2">and I&#39;m forever grateful and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.869" end="00:28:40.350" style="s2">dear God right you look at that from</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.669" end="00:28:42.059" style="s2">Health and Human Services if you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.350" end="00:28:43.649" style="s2">who are any other kind of grounded</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.059" end="00:28:46.379" style="s2">perspective you&#39;re like that is abuse</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.649" end="00:28:49.259" style="s2">but within that frame and even within</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.379" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">his interior experience what right</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.259" end="00:28:53.009" style="s2">so you have this claim of I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">subject to some interest objective</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.009" end="00:28:56.129" style="s2">critique I&#39;m no longer human in the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:57.179" style="s2">you&#39;re human everything that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.129" end="00:28:59.759" style="s2">experiencing is your shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.179" end="00:29:02.190" style="s2">projections or this is crazy wisdom I</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.759" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">might be acting batshit I&#39;ll grant you</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.190" end="00:29:06.590" style="s2">that but I&#39;m doing it for your</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:09.779" style="s2">liberation and that leaves people</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.590" end="00:29:12.989" style="s2">absolutely gone and rudderless from any</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.779" end="00:29:15.659" style="s2">kind of recalibration and any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.989" end="00:29:18.950" style="s2">mutuality and then the final one which</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.659" end="00:29:22.830" style="s2">often comes especially when people adopt</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.950" end="00:29:24.950" style="s2">Eastern habits and customs in</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.830" end="00:29:27.659" style="s2">hierarchies is ritualized separation</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.950" end="00:29:30.359" style="s2">ritualized separation of the leader the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.659" end="00:29:33.179" style="s2">founder whatever that person is from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.359" end="00:29:34.950" style="s2">rest and and that can lead to you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.179" end="00:29:36.840" style="s2">and that will show up as things like</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.950" end="00:29:38.789" style="s2">satsang you know Bush is basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.840" end="00:29:41.100" style="s2">translated is sitting experiencing the</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.970" end="00:29:49.139" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference in robes and dress</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.669" end="00:29:50.580" style="s2">you know if you&#39;ve ever seen somebody</p>
