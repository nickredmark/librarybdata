<p begin="00:01:40.790" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">really insightful thinker and brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">educator on many of the issues that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:56.369" style="s2">most critical and that I care about the</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">footnotes version there&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">like 15 minutes video that was produced</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:15.390" style="s2">on sacred economics that is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">a good introduction beyond this to some</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.390" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">of the ideas there you had a book called</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">the ascent of humanity and recently</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">wrote a book on climate change and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:29.730" style="s2">called climate a new story and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:31.500" style="s2">it&#39;s about issues associated with</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.730" end="00:02:33.600" style="s2">climate change but it is also in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.500" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">ways inclusive of many of the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.600" end="00:02:38.940" style="s2">thoughts throughout much of his work to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:42.390" style="s2">date and so I&#39;m excited for us to dive</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.940" end="00:02:43.980" style="s2">in on this topic and he&#39;s sharing an</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.390" end="00:02:46.950" style="s2">alternate narrative about how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.980" end="00:02:49.710" style="s2">approach climate change to the standard</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:55.620" style="s2">environmental narrative that is as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.710" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">deep ecologist and yeah I&#39;m excited to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.620" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">dive in Charles thanks for being here</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:05.610" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m excited also so climate change</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:07.380" style="s2">is has become almost as polarizing a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.610" end="00:03:09.660" style="s2">topic as like gay marriage or abortion</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.380" end="00:03:11.850" style="s2">in terms of how radically different</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.660" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">political left and right views on it are</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.850" end="00:03:21.090" style="s2">and you are bringing about a view in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.170" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">book that is none of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.090" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">narratives and while discussing the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">perspectives of both what people would</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">call climate denial and kind of standard</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">narrative climate change can you just</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:37.830" style="s2">share for people who haven&#39;t read the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">book kind of high-level overview what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.830" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">your what is your primary thesis on</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:46.950" style="s2">climate change how we think about it how</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:49.500" style="s2">we approach it how we could or might</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.950" end="00:03:51.239" style="s2">want to approach it differently yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.500" end="00:03:55.020" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the kind of entry</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.239" end="00:03:59.340" style="s2">point yeah there&#39;s a few a few different</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.020" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">entry points I could talk about you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.340" end="00:04:05.520" style="s2">right in saying that it&#39;s not not only</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">is it not the left narrative or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.520" end="00:04:08.730" style="s2">right narrative but it&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:12.690" style="s2">compromise between those two narratives</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.730" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">but really off the spectrum because you</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.690" end="00:04:18.540" style="s2">mentioned a polarization what I find to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:21.780" style="s2">be true in any polarized issue is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.540" end="00:04:25.169" style="s2">the key to resolving it or to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.780" end="00:04:27.450" style="s2">understanding it even lies in the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.169" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">that both sides in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.450" end="00:04:32.910" style="s2">listen agree on without knowing it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:36.630" style="s2">on the questions that nobody&#39;s bothered</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.910" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">to ask so in the book I&#39;m offering a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.630" end="00:04:43.380" style="s2">different framework a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:45.860" style="s2">viewpoint I call it I guess one way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:49.430" style="s2">talk about it is from the living Earth</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.860" end="00:04:55.020" style="s2">perspective the living Earth paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.430" end="00:04:59.490" style="s2">which recognizes that the planet is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.020" end="00:05:02.250" style="s2">living being that the forests the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.490" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">the rivers the water the elephants even</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.250" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">the whales the Wolves the salmon the</p>

<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:16.140" style="s2">especially the Amazon the Congo these</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.930" end="00:05:19.560" style="s2">are all organs of a living being and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.140" end="00:05:22.590" style="s2">that means that if we even if we cut</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.560" end="00:05:24.660" style="s2">carbon emissions to zero and install</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.590" end="00:05:29.430" style="s2">giant carbon sucking machines in every</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.660" end="00:05:33.900" style="s2">city and go into negative emissions if</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.430" end="00:05:35.960" style="s2">we continue to destroy these organs then</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.900" end="00:05:38.670" style="s2">the planet will die of organ failure</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.960" end="00:05:45.300" style="s2">whether or not that goes along with</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.670" end="00:05:48.060" style="s2">rising temperatures so it it offers a it</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.300" end="00:05:50.970" style="s2">could even be a bypass in a good way a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.060" end="00:05:53.850" style="s2">bypass of entrenched political positions</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.970" end="00:05:57.870" style="s2">they say actually you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.850" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">believe in greenhouse gas gas induced</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.870" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">global warming to still be opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:07.050" style="s2">say seismic testing seismic surveys of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.690" style="s2">the ocean floor to the drill for oil and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.050" end="00:06:12.420" style="s2">gas because it&#39;s deafening the whales</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.690" end="00:06:17.130" style="s2">and killing the whales and and causing</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.420" end="00:06:20.030" style="s2">mass plankton die-off and those are even</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.130" end="00:06:22.590" style="s2">if you&#39;re completely and this is another</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.030" end="00:06:24.630" style="s2">perspective I&#39;m offering in the book an</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.590" end="00:06:28.170" style="s2">invitation away from instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.630" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">utilitarianism that values nature for</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.170" end="00:06:33.420" style="s2">its service to ourselves and holds it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.990" style="s2">yeah holds it valuable only in what it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.420" end="00:06:39.000" style="s2">can provide to us and instead to say so</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.990" end="00:06:40.689" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that the planet will die</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.000" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">and bad things will happen to uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.689" end="00:06:46.469" style="s2">if we continue our ways but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:49.659" style="s2">calling on our innate Biophilia like</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.469" end="00:06:54.779" style="s2">suppose bad things don&#39;t happen to us if</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.659" end="00:06:57.879" style="s2">we commit ecocide suppose we could</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.779" end="00:07:01.419" style="s2">produce a future where he live in bubble</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.879" end="00:07:04.329" style="s2">cities and all of nature is dead and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.419" end="00:07:07.899" style="s2">grow that in foods and food and vats you</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.329" end="00:07:11.849" style="s2">know and and we regulate the atmospheric</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.899" end="00:07:15.969" style="s2">composition with machines and we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.849" end="00:07:18.369" style="s2">high-definition VR experiences of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.969" end="00:07:22.779" style="s2">nature that&#39;s been lost like suppose we</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.369" end="00:07:25.329" style="s2">could do that do we want to or are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.779" end="00:07:28.649" style="s2">beings of nature valuable in and of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.329" end="00:07:32.319" style="s2">themselves as objects worthy of love and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.649" end="00:07:34.360" style="s2">that connects back to the liminal from</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.319" end="00:07:36.699" style="s2">going on too long here but that connects</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.360" end="00:07:39.369" style="s2">back to the living earth paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.699" end="00:07:41.049" style="s2">because it&#39;s totally irrational and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.369" end="00:07:43.779" style="s2">delusional to love something that&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.929" end="00:07:59.559" style="s2">of we better respect the organs of gaia</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.829" end="00:08:04.149" style="s2">or the planet will die and the heart</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.559" end="00:08:08.669" style="s2">level of we love these beings let&#39;s hold</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.149" end="00:08:12.759" style="s2">them as sacred these these two are</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.669" end="00:08:15.219" style="s2">intimately entwined these two levels so</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.759" end="00:08:18.489" style="s2">that the paradigm shift is both a shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.219" end="00:08:21.189" style="s2">of our mental perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.489" end="00:08:25.419" style="s2">understanding and also a shift into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.189" end="00:08:27.419" style="s2">different heart relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.419" end="00:08:30.189" style="s2">rest of life</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.419" end="00:08:31.839" style="s2">okay so just even in that brief</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.189" end="00:08:34.300" style="s2">introduction you touched on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.839" end="00:08:36.490" style="s2">topics I want to get deeper into the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.300" end="00:08:39.189" style="s2">inadequacy of utilitarian ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.490" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">what love means beyond that and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.189" end="00:08:44.199" style="s2">problem of over focusing on a few simple</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:46.269" style="s2">metrics and living earth rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.199" end="00:08:49.090" style="s2">kind of geomechanical earth so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.269" end="00:08:53.800" style="s2">take them one at a time okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.090" end="00:08:55.900" style="s2">so I think a lot of people who would</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.800" end="00:08:58.540" style="s2">identify as caring about climate change</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.900" end="00:09:01.029" style="s2">and maybe identify as environmentalists</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.540" end="00:09:03.400" style="s2">would say yes climate change is one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.029" end="00:09:05.050" style="s2">many environmental issues there&#39;s plenty</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.400" end="00:09:08.050" style="s2">of other environmental issues species</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.050" end="00:09:11.410" style="s2">extinction pollution but this is such a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.050" end="00:09:13.180" style="s2">large and pressing issue that focusing</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.410" end="00:09:14.770" style="s2">on it doesn&#39;t automatically mean we</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.180" end="00:09:16.779" style="s2">won&#39;t have all the other problems but it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.770" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">does need deep focus within a timeline</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.779" end="00:09:26.380" style="s2">and so can you kind of respond to are</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:28.779" style="s2">you just saying climate change and other</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.380" end="00:09:31.330" style="s2">stuff are you saying something other</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.779" end="00:09:36.029" style="s2">than that yeah I&#39;m saying something</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.330" end="00:09:41.140" style="s2">other than that I&#39;m arguing for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.029" end="00:09:43.990" style="s2">reordering of our priorities because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.140" end="00:09:48.670" style="s2">think and this is where I get into</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.990" end="00:09:53.860" style="s2">trouble this is where I deviate from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.670" end="00:09:58.210" style="s2">conventional narrative I am not so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.860" end="00:10:01.240" style="s2">convinced that we understand the climate</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.210" end="00:10:05.190" style="s2">and the biosphere in general very well I</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.240" end="00:10:11.350" style="s2">think that our quantitative models are</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.190" end="00:10:15.400" style="s2">inadequate and that the critiques of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.350" end="00:10:17.710" style="s2">skeptics who actually are deniers in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.400" end="00:10:20.140" style="s2">certain sense I could go into that later</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.710" end="00:10:21.730" style="s2">like they&#39;re more hostile to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.140" end="00:10:25.900" style="s2">saying than environmentalists then</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.730" end="00:10:28.200" style="s2">climate activists are but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.900" end="00:10:32.770" style="s2">some of their critiques have merit and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.200" end="00:10:38.470" style="s2">especially the critique of science as an</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.770" end="00:10:41.380" style="s2">institution I am skeptical of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.470" end="00:10:44.920" style="s2">what scientific Authority says or what</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.380" end="00:10:50.050" style="s2">scientific convention holds is true it</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.920" end="00:10:54.670" style="s2">is you know due to problems with</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.050" end="00:10:56.589" style="s2">peer-review academic publication this</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.670" end="00:11:00.459" style="s2">kind of collective confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.589" end="00:11:02.890" style="s2">that that it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.459" end="00:11:06.970" style="s2">that greenhouse gases are day</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.890" end="00:11:09.670" style="s2">but the narrative that puts them front</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.970" end="00:11:13.650" style="s2">and center and equates environmentalism</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.670" end="00:11:16.180" style="s2">to greenhouse gases I don&#39;t trust that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.650" end="00:11:19.330" style="s2">especially because it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.180" end="00:11:22.360" style="s2">comfortably in our society&#39;s customary</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.330" end="00:11:24.370" style="s2">ways of tackling problems it fits so</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.360" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">comfortably into an accounting mindset</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.370" end="00:11:29.380" style="s2">where you have a carbon budget and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:32.260" style="s2">you add a little here you subtract a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.380" end="00:11:36.390" style="s2">little there you evaluate policies based</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.260" end="00:11:39.580" style="s2">on metrics you find a one cause of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.390" end="00:11:41.620" style="s2">everything so I can go into more like</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.580" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">all the different reasons why I distrust</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.620" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">that narrative there&#39;s also my</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">interaction with indigenous people and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:54.250" style="s2">their worldview that they cite very</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:58.510" style="s2">different reasons why the climate is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.250" end="00:12:02.560" style="s2">becoming deranged so okay so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.510" end="00:12:04.960" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t blindly trust scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:06.910" style="s2">Authority or scientific consensus okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.960" end="00:12:09.640" style="s2">anything I just want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.910" end="00:12:13.840" style="s2">before you continue for people listening</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.640" end="00:12:15.820" style="s2">I want you to notice if you just if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.840" end="00:12:18.610" style="s2">I want you to notice as we go if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.820" end="00:12:21.220" style="s2">have reactions and notice if you might</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.610" end="00:12:23.470" style="s2">have certain kinds of confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.220" end="00:12:26.230" style="s2">notice if you&#39;re running in group out</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.470" end="00:12:28.270" style="s2">group type modeling where you just said</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.230" end="00:12:30.400" style="s2">oh he said that earth is a living thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.270" end="00:12:32.620" style="s2">and he has problem with science he is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.400" end="00:12:34.930" style="s2">pseudoscience hippie and you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.620" end="00:12:35.980" style="s2">not part of our kind of like science is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.930" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">the way of making sense of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.980" end="00:12:39.670" style="s2">group or now he is part of our in-group</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:41.080" style="s2">because he&#39;s denying climate change</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.670" end="00:12:42.430" style="s2">which is awesome so we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.080" end="00:12:45.220" style="s2">environmentalist cause problems to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.430" end="00:12:47.080" style="s2">economy just kind of notice if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.220" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">flipping between existing sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.080" end="00:12:50.590" style="s2">scripts and trying to then say okay he</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:52.030" style="s2">he probably didn&#39;t do a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.590" end="00:12:55.240" style="s2">studying the research and he&#39;s doing an</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.030" end="00:12:56.920" style="s2">irresponsible thing right now you you</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.240" end="00:12:58.930" style="s2">might not know until we get further what</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.920" end="00:13:00.340" style="s2">the degree of actual research into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.930" end="00:13:03.130" style="s2">science and literature that he&#39;s done is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.340" end="00:13:04.510" style="s2">and so I just want you to notice because</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.130" end="00:13:07.180" style="s2">we&#39;re actually going to be exploring</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.510" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">very deep things here Charles in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.180" end="00:13:13.330" style="s2">book writes about problems of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:14.620" style="s2">philosophy of science not as wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.330" end="00:13:19.180" style="s2">as inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.620" end="00:13:21.730" style="s2">and of academic process and of political</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.180" end="00:13:23.500" style="s2">process and of economics writ large so</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.730" end="00:13:26.680" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be addressing all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.500" end="00:13:29.410" style="s2">like sacred cows here so just buckle up</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.680" end="00:13:31.980" style="s2">and be ready for that yeah yeah like we</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.410" end="00:13:34.390" style="s2">decide is this guy on you know our</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.980" end="00:13:36.040" style="s2">sliders he on their side well it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.390" end="00:13:37.720" style="s2">of hard to say cuz it seems like he</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.040" end="00:13:40.870" style="s2">really cares about the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.720" end="00:13:43.030" style="s2">but but he&#39;s denying climate change</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.870" end="00:13:46.390" style="s2">which I&#39;m not actually what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.030" end="00:13:48.100" style="s2">is that I don&#39;t know for sure but what</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.390" end="00:13:50.230" style="s2">do I know for sure I had this</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.100" end="00:13:53.260" style="s2">interesting interchange with a um</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.230" end="00:13:55.300" style="s2">climate activists recently who just you</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.260" end="00:13:58.060" style="s2">know in a public forum he just you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.300" end="00:14:00.610" style="s2">excoriated me as being a threat to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.060" end="00:14:03.150" style="s2">planet because I&#39;m minimizing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.610" end="00:14:07.510" style="s2">urgency of cutting greenhouse gases and</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.150" end="00:14:09.750" style="s2">I said actually as far as practical</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.510" end="00:14:13.390" style="s2">policies we agree on almost everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.750" end="00:14:15.340" style="s2">like from a living Earth perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.390" end="00:14:18.430" style="s2">from us from a perspective of reverence</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.340" end="00:14:22.660" style="s2">for the living beings that we call soil</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.430" end="00:14:24.070" style="s2">that we call a river an estuary etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.660" end="00:14:27.690" style="s2">a forest</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.070" end="00:14:30.040" style="s2">well I&#39;m opposed to fracking that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.690" end="00:14:32.980" style="s2">pollutes and insults the water I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.040" end="00:14:34.360" style="s2">opposed to offshore oil drilling I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.980" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">look at the oil spills due to marine</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.360" end="00:14:39.640" style="s2">life I&#39;m opposed to mountaintop removal</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.920" end="00:14:45.450" style="s2">tar sands excavation pipelines down the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.640" end="00:14:48.220" style="s2">line every single thing but what so so</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.450" end="00:14:51.430" style="s2">functionally the living earth</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.220" end="00:14:53.400" style="s2">perspective also means drastic</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.430" end="00:14:56.050" style="s2">reductions in greenhouse gas emissions</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.400" end="00:14:58.570" style="s2">the result would be the same or even</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.050" end="00:15:01.900" style="s2">better and this goes into the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.570" end="00:15:05.110" style="s2">what actually is greenhouse gas</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.900" end="00:15:08.830" style="s2">emissions a symptom of how do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.110" end="00:15:10.330" style="s2">actually change it is it what are the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.830" end="00:15:13.960" style="s2">underlying conditions that generate</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.330" end="00:15:15.280" style="s2">endless consumption endless economic</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.960" end="00:15:19.990" style="s2">growth endless growth in the use of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.280" end="00:15:22.660" style="s2">energy like if we want to change change</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.990" end="00:15:25.990" style="s2">the expression we have to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.660" end="00:15:28.660" style="s2">route so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.990" end="00:15:31.990" style="s2">okay so before we get into the root of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.660" end="00:15:34.660" style="s2">what drives some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.990" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">cause climate change and related issues</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.660" end="00:15:41.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think anyone has I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:43.180" style="s2">think most people are clear of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.320" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">alternate narratives on the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.180" end="00:15:48.730" style="s2">environmental issues is it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:50.140" style="s2">flooding and wildfires and coral die-off</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.730" end="00:15:51.850" style="s2">are pretty obvious signs that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.140" end="00:15:52.390" style="s2">that the main thing that we should focus</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.850" end="00:15:55.089" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.390" end="00:15:56.980" style="s2">so can you offer some alternate</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.089" end="00:16:01.240" style="s2">perspectives that are compelling for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.980" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">as to how you examine those yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.240" end="00:16:09.910" style="s2">first thing I would say is to be wary of</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">a single cause like an explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.910" end="00:16:16.089" style="s2">for everything that appeals to one thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:17.950" style="s2">that is so comforting for us that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.089" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">we are comfortable with because then</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.950" end="00:16:23.080" style="s2">there&#39;s an enemy that we can address so</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">like what about cancer I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.080" end="00:16:28.029" style="s2">decades they&#39;ve been trying to find a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:30.339" style="s2">virus if it were only a virus then we</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.029" end="00:16:32.200" style="s2">would have something to kill or a gene</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.339" end="00:16:35.380" style="s2">then we would have something to alter</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.200" end="00:16:38.709" style="s2">something to control this mindset of</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.380" end="00:16:41.430" style="s2">find the enemy or find the cause extends</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.709" end="00:16:47.110" style="s2">to politics extends to criminal justice</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.430" end="00:16:50.230" style="s2">the recent terror medicine yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.110" end="00:16:52.899" style="s2">and it also is part of the mentality of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.230" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">money which is the one thing that will</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.899" end="00:16:57.760" style="s2">solve all your problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:17:01.000" style="s2">if only I had this one thing so the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.760" end="00:17:02.200" style="s2">unitary means to the universal and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.000" end="00:17:04.300" style="s2">guess you could say or the universal</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.200" end="00:17:08.589" style="s2">means so that said that&#39;s my disclaimer</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.300" end="00:17:15.610" style="s2">so then I would look for a matrix of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.589" end="00:17:17.470" style="s2">causes that that maybe don&#39;t distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.610" end="00:17:19.209" style="s2">all the time between what&#39;s a cause and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.470" end="00:17:23.020" style="s2">what&#39;s in effect what&#39;s a symptom was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.209" end="00:17:26.230" style="s2">cause as far as sir lists so like I</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.020" end="00:17:28.209" style="s2">don&#39;t have a one thing but I could talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.230" end="00:17:32.470" style="s2">about a few things I think the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.209" end="00:17:35.320" style="s2">one is the water cycle I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.470" end="00:17:38.429" style="s2">we focus on a substance as the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.320" end="00:17:38.429" style="s2">important thing to it</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.680" end="00:17:46.150" style="s2">change our relationship to it would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.050" end="00:17:49.510" style="s2">water and not carbon so a lot of what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.150" end="00:17:52.630" style="s2">ordinarily blamed on global warming I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.510" end="00:17:55.480" style="s2">think is actually due to disruptions in</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.630" end="00:17:59.500" style="s2">the hydrological cycle through</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.480" end="00:18:03.910" style="s2">deforestation and what I call soil abuse</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.500" end="00:18:07.950" style="s2">which basically means plowing exposing</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.910" end="00:18:11.320" style="s2">air soil destroy but also destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.950" end="00:18:13.390" style="s2">microbiota of the soil destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.320" end="00:18:16.120" style="s2">earthworms destroying the ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.390" end="00:18:19.809" style="s2">that that interact with soil and keep it</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.120" end="00:18:22.750" style="s2">alive and intact and able to absorb rain</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.809" end="00:18:26.190" style="s2">in a healthy ecosystem there&#39;s almost no</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.750" end="00:18:29.110" style="s2">runoff everything soaks into the earth</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.190" end="00:18:32.650" style="s2">into the soil or down to the aquifers</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.110" end="00:18:34.270" style="s2">and then trees and deep-rooted grasses</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.650" end="00:18:35.890" style="s2">and then some grasses have roots that go</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.270" end="00:18:41.170" style="s2">like 10 20 30 feet</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.890" end="00:18:44.650" style="s2">they transpire the water long after the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.170" end="00:18:49.710" style="s2">rainy season has passed and they say so</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.650" end="00:18:49.710" style="s2">they extend the rainy season they</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:57.100" style="s2">stimulate the formation of clouds</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.059" end="00:19:00.790" style="s2">through their volatile compounds through</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.100" end="00:19:03.220" style="s2">their there through even bacteria that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.790" end="00:19:04.780" style="s2">live in the plants that seed the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.220" end="00:19:07.929" style="s2">formation of clouds because they</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.780" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">nucleate ice on them I mean it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.929" end="00:19:13.570" style="s2">super complicated but you cut down the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:16.750" style="s2">forests and the rain stopped coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.570" end="00:19:19.390" style="s2">not to mention so not only do they they</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.750" end="00:19:21.160" style="s2">recycle water back into the air and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.390" end="00:19:24.940" style="s2">it rains again and they keep the rain</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.160" end="00:19:28.120" style="s2">going but they also bring in water from</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.940" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">the oceans because when this huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.120" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">of moisture evaporates and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:34.510" style="s2">condenses the condensation creates a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:37.000" style="s2">low-pressure zone that creates what they</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.510" end="00:19:39.580" style="s2">call a biotic pump that&#39;s responsible</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.000" end="00:19:42.070" style="s2">for the flying rivers of Brazil that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.580" end="00:19:43.570" style="s2">that just draws in moisture Laden air</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.070" end="00:19:45.700" style="s2">from the oceans into the continental</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.570" end="00:19:48.280" style="s2">interiors so but you get the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.700" end="00:19:50.650" style="s2">Earth essence as a physiology there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.280" end="00:19:51.290" style="s2">physiology here so you cut down the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.650" end="00:19:53.780" style="s2">forest</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.290" end="00:19:58.870" style="s2">where you destroy the soils ability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.780" end="00:20:01.250" style="s2">soak in the water and you have flooding</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.870" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">because there&#39;s no sponge anymore where</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.250" end="00:20:05.930" style="s2">you fill in the wetlands that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:08.180" style="s2">big one you have flooding and then after</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.930" end="00:20:10.040" style="s2">the flooding there&#39;s no water in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.180" end="00:20:15.850" style="s2">water table or in the soil so you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.040" end="00:20:18.860" style="s2">droughts and rather than indict our</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.850" end="00:20:21.800" style="s2">agricultural practices our development -</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.860" end="00:20:24.710" style="s2">the whole ideology of development of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.800" end="00:20:26.330" style="s2">whole relationship to the land boy it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.710" end="00:20:28.160" style="s2">would be a lot easier just to install</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.330" end="00:20:31.540" style="s2">some carbon sucking machines everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.160" end="00:20:34.160" style="s2">do a little bit of of geoengineering and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.540" end="00:20:37.450" style="s2">continuous business continue business as</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.160" end="00:20:40.340" style="s2">normal which is often what is meant by</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.450" end="00:20:44.210" style="s2">sustainability like what do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.340" end="00:20:48.980" style="s2">sustain here and I think that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.210" end="00:20:51.950" style="s2">the carbon narrative is more friendly -</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.980" end="00:20:54.500" style="s2">at least superficially more friendly to</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.950" end="00:20:57.110" style="s2">the status quo because it suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.500" end="00:20:59.810" style="s2">we can just come up with some other</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.110" end="00:21:02.990" style="s2">fuels and essentially continue business</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.810" end="00:21:05.300" style="s2">as usual and I think I guess I&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.990" end="00:21:08.060" style="s2">for a deeper radicalism that says no no</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.300" end="00:21:10.130" style="s2">no what needs to change is our entire</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.060" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">relationship and way of seeing the earth</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.130" end="00:21:17.470" style="s2">to hold every place every bio region</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:20.650" style="s2">every every ecosystem every species as</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.470" end="00:21:24.770" style="s2">important valuable and even sacred</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.650" end="00:21:28.040" style="s2">nothing less is going to bring health -</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.770" end="00:21:29.870" style="s2">to this earth so when you started with</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:31.610" style="s2">the hydrological cycle someone could</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.870" end="00:21:33.170" style="s2">have almost got excited for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.610" end="00:21:35.570" style="s2">that you were shifting the focus from</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.170" end="00:21:37.340" style="s2">carbon to water but they&#39;re still kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.570" end="00:21:38.570" style="s2">of one thing to pay attention to but</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.340" end="00:21:40.300" style="s2">then of course what you said about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.570" end="00:21:42.530" style="s2">hydrological cycle wasn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.300" end="00:21:46.540" style="s2">addressing water directly it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.530" end="00:21:51.470" style="s2">addressing plants and soil man hugs and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.540" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">etc so when you say water you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.470" end="00:21:54.620" style="s2">paying attention to a cycle that depends</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:58.790" style="s2">on a lot of things other than water</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.620" end="00:22:01.970" style="s2">right including carbon I mean the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.790" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">that that improve the hydrological cycle</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.970" end="00:22:06.510" style="s2">are also things that improve this so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:09.510" style="s2">and which also happened to sequester a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.510" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">lot of carbon so if you want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.510" end="00:22:15.090" style="s2">it through the carbon like it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:17.850" style="s2">the water the water paradigm is inimical</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.090" end="00:22:21.810" style="s2">to the carbon paradigm they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.850" end="00:22:24.080" style="s2">deeply intimately connected and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.810" end="00:22:27.450" style="s2">why there&#39;s actually a lot of overlap</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.080" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">with with you know say the drawdown</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.450" end="00:22:31.560" style="s2">perspective which puts regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:35.400" style="s2">agriculture pretty high on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.560" end="00:22:39.810" style="s2">list so what you know you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.400" end="00:22:41.910" style="s2">about understanding flooding and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.810" end="00:22:46.040" style="s2">understanding droughts and correspondent</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.910" end="00:22:51.180" style="s2">lis wildfires as not just a result of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.040" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">greenhouse gas based climate change what</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.180" end="00:22:57.030" style="s2">about I mean what about ocean</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:23:02.790" style="s2">acidification and coral yeah here again</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.030" end="00:23:07.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t know let&#39;s let&#39;s start with that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.790" end="00:23:11.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but I am when I when I look</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.980" end="00:23:14.730" style="s2">at the ocean as alive and want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.550" end="00:23:17.070" style="s2">understand its physiology then I look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.730" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">things like maybe there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.070" end="00:23:21.330" style="s2">perspectives one would be the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:25.680" style="s2">perspective of fish and whales I read</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.330" end="00:23:29.940" style="s2">one paper that said that 50% of layer</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.680" end="00:23:33.240" style="s2">mixing in the ocean is generated by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.940" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">kinetic mixing effects of fish and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.240" end="00:23:38.850" style="s2">whales and and just marine life in</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:43.950" style="s2">general like life contributes as much as</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.850" end="00:23:49.050" style="s2">wind and geomechanical currents to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.950" end="00:23:50.280" style="s2">mixing of ocean layers as as as don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.050" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">member the beginning of that sense but</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.280" end="00:23:54.870" style="s2">you get the picture like life is really</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:24:00.810" style="s2">important to bringing the cold</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.870" end="00:24:02.540" style="s2">nutrient-rich water to the surface and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.810" end="00:24:06.810" style="s2">you know you remove keystone species</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.540" end="00:24:09.170" style="s2">like the I mean populations of sharks of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.810" end="00:24:12.330" style="s2">bluefin tuna like the big predators</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.170" end="00:24:14.430" style="s2">orcas sperm whales I mean these these</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.330" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">the populations of these creatures have</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.430" end="00:24:21.330" style="s2">precipitously declined due mostly to</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:24.990" style="s2">overfishing and to commercial whaling so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.330" end="00:24:27.240" style="s2">these organs of the ocean aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.990" end="00:24:31.800" style="s2">functioning anymore so of course things</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.240" end="00:24:33.870" style="s2">are gonna go awry of course the all</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.800" end="00:24:35.850" style="s2">systems will become less resilient I</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.870" end="00:24:39.060" style="s2">mean that the trophic cascades you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.850" end="00:24:43.320" style="s2">that it&#39;s that start when you remove all</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.060" end="00:24:46.770" style="s2">of the workers or you edge the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.320" end="00:24:49.050" style="s2">with drift nets like these these who</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.770" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">knows what kind of effects that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.050" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">produce and again I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:25:01.080" style="s2">like I&#39;m not denying that higher</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.320" end="00:25:05.070" style="s2">atmospheric carbon dioxide contributes</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.080" end="00:25:08.280" style="s2">to ocean acidification but also you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.070" end="00:25:13.320" style="s2">like if you I was some of the literature</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.280" end="00:25:16.700" style="s2">I read was just about the incredible</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.320" end="00:25:20.460" style="s2">abundance of wildlife before</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.700" end="00:25:22.700" style="s2">colonization you know you had like in</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.460" end="00:25:27.060" style="s2">the Chesapeake Bay for example just</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.700" end="00:25:32.730" style="s2">massive quantities of shellfish just</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.060" end="00:25:34.440" style="s2">just like unbelievable amounts you had a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.730" end="00:25:38.790" style="s2">stirs that were a foot long a foot</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.440" end="00:25:42.600" style="s2">across you know so that wife was</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.790" end="00:25:45.060" style="s2">removing vast amounts of carbon in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.600" end="00:25:48.330" style="s2">form of calcium carbonate from from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.060" end="00:25:50.580" style="s2">water and and when you have healthy</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.330" end="00:25:54.270" style="s2">nutrient transport you have kelp beds</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.580" end="00:25:56.190" style="s2">that that alkalis the water and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.270" end="00:25:57.780" style="s2">have the shelf there&#39;s feeding on you</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.190" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">know the different fish and shellfish</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.780" end="00:26:02.280" style="s2">feeding on the kelp and sequestering</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:04.500" style="s2">where fish even excrete calcium</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.280" end="00:26:08.340" style="s2">carbonate as well like you have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.500" end="00:26:10.860" style="s2">physiology that&#39;s functioning so I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.340" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">that I mean basically my perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.860" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">that greenhouse gases are putting</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:18.510" style="s2">additional stress on a seriously</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:19.680" style="s2">weakened physiology so I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.510" end="00:26:23.400" style="s2">that they&#39;re no problem that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.680" end="00:26:26.190" style="s2">a problem but I think that if we had if</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.400" end="00:26:28.350" style="s2">we you know we had resilient robust</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.190" end="00:26:30.150" style="s2">ecosystems if we hadn&#39;t destroyed half</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.350" end="00:26:31.890" style="s2">of the mangrove swamps in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.150" end="00:26:34.590" style="s2">eighty percent of the secret</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.890" end="00:26:39.710" style="s2">meadows and and have 2/3 of the rain</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.590" end="00:26:42.090" style="s2">forests etc etc etc down the line then</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.710" end="00:26:45.450" style="s2">Atmos like changes in greenhouse gases</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.090" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">would not be much of a problem and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.450" end="00:26:50.520" style="s2">not even like I could go more like as</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:54.440" style="s2">far as these cup of causes of ecological</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.520" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">degradation toxic pollution</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.440" end="00:26:59.370" style="s2">pharmaceutical pollution pesticide</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:01.680" style="s2">pollution and we&#39;ve doused the entire</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.370" end="00:27:04.620" style="s2">land surface almost with pesticides for</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.680" end="00:27:08.130" style="s2">90 years I mean what does that do to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.620" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">insect life to to bacterial life to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.130" end="00:27:12.870" style="s2">mycelial networks and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.150" style="s2">electromagnetic pollution</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.870" end="00:27:17.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve just been starting to look into</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.150" end="00:27:19.320" style="s2">some stuff around 5g and you know what</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.790" end="00:27:24.660" style="s2">that does to humans but also what is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.320" end="00:27:27.800" style="s2">due to insects yeah so this is a this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.660" end="00:27:31.260" style="s2">a really good point when you mention</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.800" end="00:27:33.960" style="s2">kind of Ubiquiti pesticide use and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.260" end="00:27:36.180" style="s2">know even even things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.960" end="00:27:37.890" style="s2">intended aspetta sides that end up being</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.180" end="00:27:39.420" style="s2">pesticides like glyphosate which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.890" end="00:27:41.340" style="s2">intended as an herbicide but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.420" end="00:27:44.910" style="s2">an antibiotic and an anti-parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.340" end="00:27:48.450" style="s2">which also means NT bug and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.910" end="00:27:49.710" style="s2">the graphs of the usage in tonnes per</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.450" end="00:27:51.750" style="s2">year and then you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.710" end="00:27:54.270" style="s2">correlation of species extinction of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.750" end="00:27:58.020" style="s2">flying insects there pollinators and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.270" end="00:28:00.510" style="s2">there&#39;s strong correlation and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.020" end="00:28:03.150" style="s2">good example of like you know 50 percent</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.510" end="00:28:07.350" style="s2">of die-off of flying insects in the last</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.150" end="00:28:12.660" style="s2">decade is more concerning to me as an</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.350" end="00:28:16.200" style="s2">ecological crisis than atmospheric co2</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.660" end="00:28:17.970" style="s2">levels and so one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.200" end="00:28:20.370" style="s2">bring up is hey what that doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.970" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">that much attention because we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.370" end="00:28:24.450" style="s2">all the environmental attention has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:26.810" style="s2">be funneled into carbon sequestration or</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.450" end="00:28:29.370" style="s2">you know cap-and-trade on missions and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.810" end="00:28:31.110" style="s2">so not only might there be more critical</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.370" end="00:28:32.940" style="s2">environmental issues that are going but</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.110" end="00:28:34.880" style="s2">the approach to climate change won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.940" end="00:28:37.140" style="s2">even work because to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.880" end="00:28:38.820" style="s2">animals are actually serving a role in</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.140" end="00:28:42.360" style="s2">the carbon cycle or the hydrological</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.820" end="00:28:43.980" style="s2">cycle that there&#39;s a deeper process</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.360" end="00:28:47.309" style="s2">you mentioned the topic of trophic</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.980" end="00:28:50.309" style="s2">cascades and I just want to say anyone</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.309" end="00:28:52.200" style="s2">who hasn&#39;t studied trophic cascades the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.309" end="00:28:55.590" style="s2">classic example that made this famous</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.200" end="00:28:58.440" style="s2">was the Yellowstone wolves and just go</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.590" end="00:29:01.470" style="s2">to youtube and check out the video how</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.440" end="00:29:05.070" style="s2">wolves change rivers it&#39;s mind-blowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.470" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">how a single keystone species the top of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.070" end="00:29:14.309" style="s2">a predatory ecosystem ends up changing</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">the whole ecological niche and so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.309" end="00:29:20.250" style="s2">reintroduction of wolves not only</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:23.549" style="s2">increased all of the species but because</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.250" end="00:29:25.889" style="s2">of the way that the trees stabilized the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.549" end="00:29:29.100" style="s2">soil it changed the actual hydrology of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.889" end="00:29:31.440" style="s2">the space the river dynamics so now when</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.100" end="00:29:33.480" style="s2">Charles is talking about what we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.440" end="00:29:35.720" style="s2">done to large fish species in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.480" end="00:29:38.100" style="s2">and you start to get a sense of like oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.720" end="00:29:40.409" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s no there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.100" end="00:29:42.899" style="s2">whales left and if the whales are</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.409" end="00:29:44.549" style="s2">bringing nutrient-rich water and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.899" end="00:29:45.960" style="s2">coming up to the photic Renee and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.549" end="00:29:48.210" style="s2">defecating and that&#39;s a part of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.960" end="00:29:50.340" style="s2">allows for the kelp blooms that are part</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.210" end="00:29:52.799" style="s2">of what supports the coral you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.340" end="00:29:54.450" style="s2">not and and also even if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.799" end="00:29:56.450" style="s2">hydrologic cycle and you say how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.450" end="00:29:59.220" style="s2">not just water going into the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.450" end="00:30:01.409" style="s2">but it is bacteria they didn&#39;t up being</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.220" end="00:30:02.580" style="s2">a part of cloud seeding it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.409" end="00:30:06.289" style="s2">like we can say okay well let&#39;s study</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.580" end="00:30:08.850" style="s2">nature better to then find a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.289" end="00:30:11.399" style="s2">active metrics rather than one let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.850" end="00:30:13.710" style="s2">let&#39;s make three metrics and try not as</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.399" end="00:30:16.500" style="s2">for those its what is it how does a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.710" end="00:30:18.510" style="s2">complex self-organizing system actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.500" end="00:30:21.090" style="s2">self organize and how do we support that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.510" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">as opposed to things that it&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.090" end="00:30:27.450" style="s2">and override it yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:33.269" style="s2">well said I came across another good</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.450" end="00:30:36.630" style="s2">example of trophic cascades in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.269" end="00:30:40.940" style="s2">conversation with Brock Dolman who Lisa</p>

<p begin="00:30:43.470" end="00:30:51.779" style="s2">exactly anyway he was he was describing</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.549" end="00:30:54.630" style="s2">the effect of dams on creating forest</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.779" end="00:30:55.660" style="s2">fires because the dams prevent the</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.700" end="00:31:12.280" style="s2">forests so the forests which he says</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.340" end="00:31:14.740" style="s2">some of them isotopic analysis says that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.280" end="00:31:18.340" style="s2">half of their nitrogen is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.740" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">the ocean so the forest now become less</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.340" end="00:31:23.080" style="s2">resilient and more susceptible to forest</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:24.670" style="s2">fire so like how do you encompass that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.080" end="00:31:27.670" style="s2">in a metric and then of course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.670" end="00:31:30.310" style="s2">gonna release carbon dioxide and no</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.670" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">longer hold and then once they burn no</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.310" end="00:31:36.010" style="s2">longer holding down the soil so the soil</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:36.460" style="s2">oxidizes and runs off and cetera etc</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.010" end="00:31:38.830" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.460" end="00:31:40.840" style="s2">so how are you going to encompass that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.830" end="00:31:44.740" style="s2">in your metrics it&#39;s almost impossible</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.840" end="00:31:47.380" style="s2">to the metrics as far as dams go they</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.740" end="00:31:50.710" style="s2">give dams a carbon positive you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.380" end="00:31:53.260" style="s2">they allow the generation of electricity</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.710" end="00:31:57.460" style="s2">without fossil fuels so dams are of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.260" end="00:32:00.280" style="s2">benefit in the existing metrics so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.460" end="00:32:02.560" style="s2">metrics based mind wants to extend the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.280" end="00:32:05.530" style="s2">metrics and say well let&#39;s take into</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.560" end="00:32:08.770" style="s2">account the methane from the areas</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.530" end="00:32:10.750" style="s2">inundated by the dams and balance that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.770" end="00:32:14.560" style="s2">off with it like you can extend the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.750" end="00:32:17.190" style="s2">metrics to some point but how are you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.560" end="00:32:20.650" style="s2">going to extend it to the salmon or</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.190" end="00:32:24.010" style="s2">beavers or wolves or whales because the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.650" end="00:32:28.060" style="s2">the their effects are so diffuse through</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.010" end="00:32:30.550" style="s2">the ecosystem through the highly</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.060" end="00:32:33.550" style="s2">nonlinear cycles of cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.550" end="00:32:36.130" style="s2">like you can&#39;t you can&#39;t do that and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.550" end="00:32:39.280" style="s2">delusion that you can that gets to one</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.130" end="00:32:42.730" style="s2">of the deeper metaphysical principles of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.280" end="00:32:45.130" style="s2">science that that or maybe it&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.730" end="00:32:47.410" style="s2">a well it starts with a metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.130" end="00:32:50.830" style="s2">principle that that the whole world can</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.410" end="00:32:54.310" style="s2">be reduced to number and is therefore if</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.830" end="00:32:56.770" style="s2">you ignore chaos theory that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.310" end="00:33:00.820" style="s2">therefore amenable to prediction and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.770" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">control and that the improvement of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.820" end="00:33:06.220" style="s2">human estate depends on improving our</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:08.800" style="s2">ability to measure and control</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.220" end="00:33:10.600" style="s2">everything and that we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.800" end="00:33:13.480" style="s2">becoming better and better at that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.600" end="00:33:16.570" style="s2">that yeah that progress consists of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.480" end="00:33:18.910" style="s2">extending our measures to a greater and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.570" end="00:33:20.890" style="s2">greater area but in practice what</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.910" end="00:33:22.210" style="s2">happens is that the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.890" end="00:33:25.330" style="s2">can&#39;t measure you just don&#39;t bother to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.210" end="00:33:27.220" style="s2">measure and they get left out even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.330" end="00:33:30.550" style="s2">they turn out to be more important than</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.220" end="00:33:31.990" style="s2">the things you do measure or you decide</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.550" end="00:33:33.670" style="s2">not to measure the things that are going</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.990" end="00:33:37.120" style="s2">to harm your personal economic</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.670" end="00:33:39.610" style="s2">self-interest or that of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:42.280" style="s2">institution&#39;s you&#39;re working for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.610" end="00:33:47.830" style="s2">very convenient to leave certain things</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.280" end="00:33:49.860" style="s2">out if they harm your profits so forgive</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.830" end="00:33:53.470" style="s2">me for being a little bit cynical but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.860" end="00:33:56.170" style="s2">think that yeah it&#39;s not just a matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.470" end="00:33:58.030" style="s2">of including more in our metrics thereby</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.170" end="00:34:01.060" style="s2">preserving our quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.030" end="00:34:05.740" style="s2">decision-making processes but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.060" end="00:34:10.000" style="s2">really - and it&#39;s not - Anna it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.740" end="00:34:11.890" style="s2">abandon the quantitative method it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.000" end="00:34:16.649" style="s2">to abandon science it&#39;s not to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.890" end="00:34:18.760" style="s2">those things but it is to put those</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.649" end="00:34:23.169" style="s2">methods and that way of seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.760" end="00:34:25.570" style="s2">in its proper place we could talk full</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.169" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">soft forget about that but but yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.570" end="00:34:31.230" style="s2">okay so people who have listened to this</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:33.310" style="s2">podcast historically you&#39;ll recognize it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.230" end="00:34:34.659" style="s2">what Charles is talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.310" end="00:34:37.000" style="s2">something we&#39;ve talked about quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.659" end="00:34:40.510" style="s2">and particularly in the area of health</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.000" end="00:34:43.330" style="s2">care and because setting a body which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.510" end="00:34:45.040" style="s2">obviously a living self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.330" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">complex system is a really good way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.040" end="00:34:51.669" style="s2">pay attention to this we try and reduce</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:53.950" style="s2">health to some small set of metrics we</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.669" end="00:34:55.570" style="s2">end up doing things like saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.950" end="00:34:57.550" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna pay attention to your</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.570" end="00:34:59.710" style="s2">cholesterol to your low-density</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.550" end="00:35:01.360" style="s2">lipoprotein and then we&#39;re gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.710" end="00:35:06.280" style="s2">you a statin to lower it and it actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.360" end="00:35:08.110" style="s2">worked and yet it increases liver</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.280" end="00:35:10.360" style="s2">toxicity and neurotoxicity and a number</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.110" end="00:35:12.940" style="s2">of other things so the question is can I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.360" end="00:35:16.090" style="s2">sink of low density lipoprotein or LDL</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.940" end="00:35:19.000" style="s2">HDL ratio or whatever increased metric</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.090" end="00:35:21.340" style="s2">complexity I try to look at as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.000" end="00:35:24.330" style="s2">adequate measure for health B</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.340" end="00:35:26.230" style="s2">because I in that statin approach</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.330" end="00:35:30.760" style="s2">pharmaceutical approach in general we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.230" end="00:35:34.150" style="s2">not asking well what else is going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.760" end="00:35:35.800" style="s2">associated with the LDL being high what</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.150" end="00:35:38.050" style="s2">is what are the underlying causal</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.800" end="00:35:39.460" style="s2">factors maybe it&#39;s not only one maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.050" end="00:35:43.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of them why is the body</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.460" end="00:35:44.470" style="s2">not self-regulating as well as it used</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.150" end="00:35:46.180" style="s2">to how do we support its own</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.470" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">self-regulation nope the numbers too</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.180" end="00:35:50.410" style="s2">high we&#39;re gonna give something external</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:51.880" style="s2">to lower it without paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.410" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">what else that might have been a symptom</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.880" end="00:35:55.000" style="s2">of and now the fact that we just made</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:57.220" style="s2">the regulatory system weaker and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.000" end="00:36:00.190" style="s2">dependent on that intervention yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.220" end="00:36:02.980" style="s2">perfect example like so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.190" end="00:36:06.490" style="s2">congruent to what we&#39;re doing to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.980" end="00:36:08.740" style="s2">environment like like yeah like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.490" end="00:36:11.170" style="s2">extend the metrics further and further</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.740" end="00:36:13.960" style="s2">and then you look at well who benefits</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.170" end="00:36:16.510" style="s2">from those metrics and who benefits from</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.960" end="00:36:18.940" style="s2">the entire metrics based approach the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.510" end="00:36:21.460" style="s2">entire approach of find a number find a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.940" end="00:36:23.500" style="s2">thing that you can control obviously</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.460" end="00:36:25.540" style="s2">it&#39;s the purveyors of technologies of</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.500" end="00:36:27.880" style="s2">control ie the pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.540" end="00:36:33.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re really happy if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.880" end="00:36:35.080" style="s2">can find a biological marker that in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.220" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">confusion of cause and effect they can</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.080" end="00:36:40.360" style="s2">identify as the cause and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:41.580" style="s2">take that sucker down you know you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.360" end="00:36:44.050" style="s2">reduce those levels</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.580" end="00:36:46.090" style="s2">problem solved and like you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.050" end="00:36:48.130" style="s2">you know in the training in C yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.090" end="00:36:49.960" style="s2">first it was cholesterol right just</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.130" end="00:36:53.530" style="s2">cholesterol levels and then it was LDLs</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.960" end="00:36:56.380" style="s2">and then it was something else and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.530" end="00:36:58.930" style="s2">whole time higher levels of cholesterol</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.380" end="00:37:02.950" style="s2">that could just be a symptom of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.930" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">chronic inflammation cause perhaps by</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.950" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">the very unsaturated fatty acids that</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:18.340" style="s2">are were being prescribed as beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:20.950" style="s2">you get into a morass where you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.340" end="00:37:24.040" style="s2">know you can&#39;t find one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.950" end="00:37:28.090" style="s2">causes it so yeah I think it&#39;s really so</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.040" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">let&#39;s play with this example so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.090" end="00:37:32.580" style="s2">say we look at the pharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:34.970" style="s2">approach so we have a regulatory system</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.580" end="00:37:37.190" style="s2">where the FDA says in or</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.970" end="00:37:39.230" style="s2">for a doctor to use something to treat a</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.190" end="00:37:41.720" style="s2">disease first we have to diagnose the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.230" end="00:37:43.580" style="s2">disease and agree upon disease diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.720" end="00:37:46.790" style="s2">process we&#39;re treating disease right</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.580" end="00:37:49.070" style="s2">we&#39;re not promoting health us first kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.790" end="00:37:51.080" style="s2">of thing and then we have to have an FDA</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.070" end="00:37:54.410" style="s2">approved process to treat the disease</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.080" end="00:37:56.540" style="s2">and so then the drug or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.410" end="00:37:59.720" style="s2">has to go through FDA approval and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.540" end="00:38:01.430" style="s2">process of doing that is an expensive</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.720" end="00:38:02.930" style="s2">process right I got to do phase 3</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.430" end="00:38:04.460" style="s2">clinical trials I custom most of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.930" end="00:38:07.340" style="s2">billion dollars sometimes more than that</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.460" end="00:38:10.010" style="s2">and where does the money come from to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.340" end="00:38:12.080" style="s2">that well it comes from patenting a</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.010" end="00:38:14.900" style="s2">molecule that I&#39;ll be able to because of</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.900" end="00:38:17.930" style="s2">than if I didn&#39;t patent didn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.430" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">could be competition on it once I had</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.930" end="00:38:20.930" style="s2">invested all the research and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:22.760" style="s2">sense if I&#39;m doing a billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.930" end="00:38:24.290" style="s2">with the research to get it through so</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.760" end="00:38:25.910" style="s2">I&#39;m only gonna study patentable</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.290" end="00:38:27.890" style="s2">molecules then we look in patent law and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.910" end="00:38:29.540" style="s2">we say well we can&#39;t patent molecules</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.890" end="00:38:32.180" style="s2">that occur in the body naturally or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.540" end="00:38:34.190" style="s2">environment naturally synthetic ones so</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.180" end="00:38:35.660" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna look at what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.190" end="00:38:37.700" style="s2">in the body differently when it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.660" end="00:38:39.080" style="s2">young and healthy or things in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.700" end="00:38:40.340" style="s2">environment that we co evolved it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.080" end="00:38:42.170" style="s2">going to look at synthetic there</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.340" end="00:38:44.030" style="s2">was never part of a healthy human being</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.170" end="00:38:45.530" style="s2">or a healthy environment because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.030" end="00:38:47.030" style="s2">the only stuff that I can patent that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.530" end="00:38:49.880" style="s2">can make the money back on to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.030" end="00:38:52.430" style="s2">FDA trials you say ok there&#39;s nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.880" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">fault actually I&#39;m actually not the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.430" end="00:38:58.940" style="s2">pharma companies it&#39;s a system that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:39:01.160" style="s2">oriented in a way to do a fame and there</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.940" end="00:39:02.810" style="s2">is actually like so I want to say I want</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.160" end="00:39:04.580" style="s2">to study inner bro I want to study diet</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.810" end="00:39:05.990" style="s2">I can&#39;t get it through FDA approval</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.580" end="00:39:07.400" style="s2">because there&#39;s no we&#39;re gonna get a</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.990" end="00:39:08.990" style="s2">billion dollars from for something I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.400" end="00:39:10.430" style="s2">never be able to make money back on well</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.990" end="00:39:11.900" style="s2">I can sell the herb but everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.430" end="00:39:13.100" style="s2">sell the urban undercut my price because</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.900" end="00:39:15.650" style="s2">they didn&#39;t put the billion dollars up</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.100" end="00:39:17.210" style="s2">upfront right so then we now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.650" end="00:39:19.730" style="s2">starting to look at okay well that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.210" end="00:39:21.800" style="s2">then we say even deeper we say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.730" end="00:39:23.270" style="s2">also the fact that the high cholesterol</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.800" end="00:39:25.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t necessarily have one cause it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.270" end="00:39:26.930" style="s2">might have been partially inflammation</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.640" end="00:39:28.550" style="s2">from eight different things it might</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.930" end="00:39:30.760" style="s2">have been mycotoxins affecting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.550" end="00:39:33.950" style="s2">vascular system it might have been so</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.760" end="00:39:36.410" style="s2">now we recognize that inadequacy of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.950" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">epistemic approach to medicine mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.410" end="00:39:42.380" style="s2">so now we just said our underlying</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:46.430" style="s2">epistemic approach and our regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.380" end="00:39:48.080" style="s2">systems and our fiscal incentive systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.430" end="00:39:50.780" style="s2">and our patent law</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.080" end="00:39:52.910" style="s2">are all part of the problem and so what</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.780" end="00:39:54.950" style="s2">is the solution well that that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.910" end="00:39:57.050" style="s2">like a deep civilization restructure</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.950" end="00:39:59.360" style="s2">that is necessary because it&#39;s all those</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.050" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">things now that&#39;s a pretty obvious</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.360" end="00:40:02.870" style="s2">example because most people don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:05.030" style="s2">hard time thinking about the body as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.870" end="00:40:06.440" style="s2">living interconnected system now as we</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.030" end="00:40:08.210" style="s2">start to look at the plan and say well</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.440" end="00:40:10.400" style="s2">it&#39;s actually pretty interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.210" end="00:40:12.770" style="s2">whether someone takes the metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.400" end="00:40:14.510" style="s2">it is living or not we just say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.770" end="00:40:16.970" style="s2">very interconnected we&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.510" end="00:40:18.890" style="s2">living part in a moment and it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.970" end="00:40:21.080" style="s2">self-organizing actually ecosystems are</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.890" end="00:40:22.760" style="s2">self-organizing and so we get that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.080" end="00:40:25.220" style="s2">distinction of complex versus</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.760" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">complicated right that there isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.220" end="00:40:28.580" style="s2">isn&#39;t an external blueprint that built</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:30.500" style="s2">it like there is a laptop there is this</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.580" end="00:40:33.050" style="s2">ongoing set of interacting generator</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.500" end="00:40:35.150" style="s2">functions we really do need a different</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.050" end="00:40:37.220" style="s2">way of approaching it writ large so what</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.150" end="00:40:39.560" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing up here is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.220" end="00:40:41.510" style="s2">financial incentives associated with</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.560" end="00:40:43.370" style="s2">what drives climate change and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.510" end="00:40:46.280" style="s2">regulatory issues and there&#39;s epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.370" end="00:40:49.010" style="s2">issues that&#39;s right it goes all the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.280" end="00:40:51.260" style="s2">to the bottom and it&#39;s actually no bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.010" end="00:40:52.940" style="s2">guys fault right</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.260" end="00:40:55.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the oil company&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.940" end="00:40:56.330" style="s2">guy it&#39;s like economically can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.130" end="00:40:57.860" style="s2">something very different than they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.330" end="00:40:59.240" style="s2">doing in the presence of anyone else who</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.860" end="00:41:00.830" style="s2">would do that saying in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.240" end="00:41:04.970" style="s2">regulation and the nature of market</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.830" end="00:41:07.100" style="s2">supply and demand right and and to like</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.970" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">I mean I would say I would I&#39;d be in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.100" end="00:41:12.410" style="s2">favor of a carbon tax but I understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:15.430" style="s2">that it&#39;s not going to work because we</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.410" end="00:41:17.690" style="s2">have you know if you have a system that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.430" end="00:41:20.810" style="s2">constitutionally requires more and more</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.690" end="00:41:25.460" style="s2">input of energy especially concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.810" end="00:41:28.070" style="s2">portable energy like like oil and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.460" end="00:41:31.370" style="s2">like trying to go on a diet without</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.070" end="00:41:36.290" style="s2">changing the underlying drivers of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.370" end="00:41:38.060" style="s2">cravings it&#39;s like or if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.290" end="00:41:40.870" style="s2">alcoholic and trying to quit cold-turkey</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.060" end="00:41:43.730" style="s2">when nothing else has changed when the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.870" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">trauma and the wounds and the pain that</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.730" end="00:41:48.770" style="s2">you&#39;re medicating with the alcohol is</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:51.140" style="s2">still there no amount of willpower is</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.770" end="00:41:53.270" style="s2">going to be enough to stop yourself for</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.140" end="00:41:55.190" style="s2">very long from drinking and the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.270" end="00:42:01.069" style="s2">thing is true of our addiction to fossil</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.190" end="00:42:03.650" style="s2">fuels so yes it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s a fool&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.069" end="00:42:06.529" style="s2">so this an interesting example if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.650" end="00:42:08.869" style="s2">think about someone who&#39;s got a drug</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.529" end="00:42:10.969" style="s2">addiction issue that is actually related</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.869" end="00:42:13.279" style="s2">to numbing some pain they don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.969" end="00:42:16.429" style="s2">to resolve and we see military veterans</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.279" end="00:42:18.140" style="s2">come back running PTSD from their pain</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.429" end="00:42:20.089" style="s2">or traumatic brain injury or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.140" end="00:42:21.679" style="s2">and now they&#39;re they have an opioid</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.089" end="00:42:23.719" style="s2">addiction and I&#39;ll call it that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.679" end="00:42:25.669" style="s2">so we can&#39;t just willpower them off of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.719" end="00:42:28.400" style="s2">it or shame them off of it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.669" end="00:42:30.619" style="s2">actual healing that needs to happen so</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.400" end="00:42:32.479" style="s2">you&#39;re describing something like healing</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.619" end="00:42:35.299" style="s2">that has to happen at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.479" end="00:42:37.279" style="s2">collective mm-hmm yeah and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.299" end="00:42:39.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s not that those military</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.279" end="00:42:42.769" style="s2">veterans are bad nor are there drug</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.650" end="00:42:44.449" style="s2">dealers bad there there there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.769" end="00:42:47.269" style="s2">functional necessity of the system</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.449" end="00:42:49.579" style="s2">they&#39;re generated by the system they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.269" end="00:42:52.719" style="s2">there it&#39;s it&#39;s unavoidable that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.579" end="00:42:55.130" style="s2">gonna have people playing that role so</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.719" end="00:43:02.329" style="s2">yeah I mean that&#39;s the question how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.130" end="00:43:04.069" style="s2">we how do we change the system and can</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.329" end="00:43:06.650" style="s2">you repeat what you were your question</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.069" end="00:43:09.469" style="s2">there ABS so how do you when you think</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.650" end="00:43:12.229" style="s2">about the underlying healing that happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.469" end="00:43:15.769" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s a reason that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.229" end="00:43:20.059" style="s2">discuss story and narrative law but also</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.769" end="00:43:22.609" style="s2">system so it sounds like one could take</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.059" end="00:43:24.949" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying as oh that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.609" end="00:43:30.799" style="s2">critique of the inadequacy of the carbon</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.949" end="00:43:33.380" style="s2">tax approach with no good suggestion so</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.799" end="00:43:36.049" style="s2">how do you approach how do you suggest</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.380" end="00:43:40.309" style="s2">we actually approach acknowledging the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.049" end="00:43:42.469" style="s2">complexity of the issues yeah well so</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.309" end="00:43:44.719" style="s2">there&#39;s there are different approaches</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.469" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">one is the on the level of narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.719" end="00:43:50.989" style="s2">the others on the approach is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:53.449" style="s2">approach of of of healing I would I</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.989" end="00:43:57.939" style="s2">would call it and they&#39;re related but on</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.449" end="00:44:01.279" style="s2">the level of narrative I think that too</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.939" end="00:44:04.009" style="s2">you know as a replacement for the carbon</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.279" end="00:44:08.229" style="s2">narrative it is the living Earth and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.009" end="00:44:10.369" style="s2">sacred earth narrative that also</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.229" end="00:44:13.950" style="s2">corresponds to systems theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.369" end="00:44:15.030" style="s2">thinking so the first so like I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.950" end="00:44:18.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a chapter of the book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.030" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">very very concrete says here&#39;s 17</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.119" end="00:44:21.660" style="s2">priority 217 things we need to do and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">then I&#39;ve kind of condensed them into</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.660" end="00:44:27.960" style="s2">four so number-one priority is to</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.500" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">agriculture rebuilding soil restoring</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:28.109" style="s2">guess establishing marine sanctuaries</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.430" end="00:45:35.010" style="s2">over at least half the ocean would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.109" end="00:45:37.470" style="s2">necessary to yeah so that to strengthen</p>

<p begin="00:45:37.470" end="00:45:45.960" style="s2">and third priority has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.200" end="00:45:50.520" style="s2">pesticides the herbicides the toxic</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">waste electromagnetic pollution etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.520" end="00:45:57.480" style="s2">and then number four is cut greenhouse</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:46:00.329" style="s2">gases however that is already a side</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.480" end="00:46:04.700" style="s2">effect of the first three you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.329" end="00:46:09.329" style="s2">treat earth as sacred and continue to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.700" end="00:46:11.369" style="s2">develop fossil fuels so it is really</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.329" end="00:46:14.250" style="s2">really practical but it still brings up</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.369" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">the same question how are we going to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.250" end="00:46:20.220" style="s2">those things when we still have this</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.839" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">addictive need to consume and to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.220" end="00:46:25.829" style="s2">recognize then well then and then so to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:26.910" style="s2">ask the question where does this</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.829" end="00:46:30.000" style="s2">addiction come from</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.910" end="00:46:33.990" style="s2">I like to take the addiction metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:37.859" style="s2">seriously and not to translate it into</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.990" end="00:46:39.420" style="s2">just a vector of blame you know usually</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.859" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">when people talk about our addiction to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.420" end="00:46:45.420" style="s2">fossil fuels they say so in term and in</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:47.250" style="s2">tones of disgust like oh we were just</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.420" end="00:46:49.349" style="s2">addicted we&#39;re just addicted like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.250" end="00:46:52.200" style="s2">there&#39;s some self hatred there which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.349" end="00:46:54.630" style="s2">just an internal internalization of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.200" end="00:46:56.220" style="s2">search for them for an enemy which has</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.630" end="00:46:57.660" style="s2">everything to do with the polarization</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.220" end="00:46:59.549" style="s2">that we were talking about earlier I</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.660" end="00:47:07.259" style="s2">mean this is all tied together in one</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.549" end="00:47:10.799" style="s2">big tangle but yeah like yeah so to find</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.259" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">the bad guy that&#39;s not the solution that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.799" end="00:47:15.299" style="s2">is a false solution that is a diversion</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.680" end="00:47:18.450" style="s2">from actually changing the circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.299" end="00:47:23.130" style="s2">from which the bad behavior arises or</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.450" end="00:47:25.650" style="s2">from which the addiction arises so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.130" end="00:47:28.230" style="s2">know I think that I mean not to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.650" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">oversimplify it but I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.230" end="00:47:34.220" style="s2">could say that the driver of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:37.289" style="s2">addictive consumptive society is</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.220" end="00:47:39.960" style="s2">disconnection disconnection from place</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.289" end="00:47:42.599" style="s2">from community just being alienated</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.960" end="00:47:45.589" style="s2">looking outside and how many how many of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.599" end="00:47:49.619" style="s2">these trees do I actually recognize a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.589" end="00:47:50.849" style="s2">few hundred years ago pretty much anyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.619" end="00:47:54.089" style="s2">would have been able to even in</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.849" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">wintertime name exactly which which tree</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.089" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">every single one of them was and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:48:02.569" style="s2">qualities of the wood and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:05.970" style="s2">bird nests in that tree and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.569" end="00:48:08.220" style="s2">seasonal habits of those birds and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.970" end="00:48:10.619" style="s2">what kind of soil does that tree grow in</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.220" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">and what kind of other plants grow in</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.619" end="00:48:15.230" style="s2">that soil like indigenous people can</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:19.799" style="s2">still do this if they&#39;re you know truly</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.230" end="00:48:23.490" style="s2">indigenous truly of a place and that and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.799" end="00:48:27.750" style="s2">to be alienated from all of that leaves</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.490" end="00:48:30.539" style="s2">us so hungry so desperate to recover our</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.750" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">lost beingness which is a function of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.539" end="00:48:36.359" style="s2">relationship and this goes down to like</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:37.990" style="s2">the you know ontological level like like</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.359" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">what is it to exist</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.990" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">is it just is existence a single</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:48.820" style="s2">predicate no actually it is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:51.580" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s a function of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.820" end="00:48:55.089" style="s2">relationship the more cut off we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.580" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">from relationships from intimacy to</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.089" end="00:49:03.460" style="s2">place community nature etc the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:06.820" style="s2">we are the less we exist and so this</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.460" end="00:49:10.349" style="s2">hunger to exist to recover our lost</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.820" end="00:49:13.450" style="s2">beingness that feeds consumptive habits</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.349" end="00:49:18.760" style="s2">acquisition and the insecurities we get</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.450" end="00:49:21.780" style="s2">from not belonging that feeds the quest</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.760" end="00:49:26.020" style="s2">for a substitute which is money</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.780" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">investments now I feel that I&#39;m okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.020" end="00:49:34.839" style="s2">here but really what we need is to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:36.339" style="s2">imprisoned in nature and community so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.839" end="00:49:39.190" style="s2">think that and then there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.339" end="00:49:44.200" style="s2">ideological level the ideological cutoff</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.190" end="00:49:45.940" style="s2">from nature that says that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.200" end="00:49:47.800" style="s2">just a bunch of stuff out there it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.940" end="00:49:49.510" style="s2">bunch of generic particles bouncing</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.800" end="00:49:51.940" style="s2">around according to mathematical forces</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.510" end="00:49:54.760" style="s2">there&#39;s no beingness there there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.940" end="00:49:58.390" style="s2">intelligence except what we impose upon</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.760" end="00:50:03.630" style="s2">it we&#39;re alone here and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.390" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">ideology that ends that that charts out</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.630" end="00:50:10.150" style="s2">the end point of of existence in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">ideology is that you grow old you fight</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.150" end="00:50:14.020" style="s2">to survive as long as you can you suffer</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:16.210" style="s2">more and more and then you&#39;re snuffed</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.020" end="00:50:20.050" style="s2">out like a candle so there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.210" end="00:50:25.210" style="s2">anxiety built into the separate self and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.050" end="00:50:30.070" style="s2">and yeah no wonder we are so driven to</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.210" end="00:50:33.550" style="s2">consume and so I think that also offers</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.070" end="00:50:37.540" style="s2">a a through-line</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.550" end="00:50:40.390" style="s2">to a healed future that says it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.540" end="00:50:42.310" style="s2">restoring our lost connections in our</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.390" end="00:50:44.530" style="s2">perception in our narrative about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.310" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">world and then like really practically</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.530" end="00:50:50.980" style="s2">in our systems like like how what kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:55.039" style="s2">of systems could we have that we store</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.980" end="00:50:58.549" style="s2">community that restore our connection to</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.039" end="00:51:02.450" style="s2">place so it does get very very practical</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.549" end="00:51:05.930" style="s2">and it&#39;s also philosophical ok so I want</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.450" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">to explore deeper the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.930" end="00:51:10.730" style="s2">describing addiction because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:12.049" style="s2">you were gonna and I think you would do</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.730" end="00:51:14.329" style="s2">both I thought you&#39;re gonna describe</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.049" end="00:51:16.760" style="s2">addiction at the kind of macro system</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.329" end="00:51:18.589" style="s2">level of saying hey if by addiction we</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.760" end="00:51:20.089" style="s2">mean some kind of repetitive compulsive</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.589" end="00:51:21.589" style="s2">behavior of something that we know isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.089" end="00:51:25.400" style="s2">in our highest good buts can&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.589" end="00:51:27.859" style="s2">stop then there&#39;s plenty of reasons at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.400" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">system dynamic level where you say like</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.859" end="00:51:31.730" style="s2">okay the fact that we have a monetary</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:34.039" style="s2">system that requires exponential growth</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.730" end="00:51:35.660" style="s2">of monetary supply which to not debase</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.039" end="00:51:37.670" style="s2">the currency requires increased goods</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.660" end="00:51:39.950" style="s2">and services kind of fits that right</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.670" end="00:51:42.740" style="s2">like a deep economic monetary structured</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.950" end="00:51:44.359" style="s2">change but you went to the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.740" end="00:51:48.769" style="s2">personal and the interpersonal which i</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.359" end="00:51:52.460" style="s2">think is a critically interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.769" end="00:51:54.349" style="s2">had Tristan Harrison on this podcast not</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.460" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">long ago talking about the addiction</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.349" end="00:51:59.059" style="s2">properties associate with Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:01.670" style="s2">smartphone use obviously they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.059" end="00:52:04.309" style="s2">more back with us and worse than sugar</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.670" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">and opioids because sugar and opioids</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.309" end="00:52:08.750" style="s2">don&#39;t get fully personalized to someone</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:11.210" style="s2">psyche with real-time biometric feedback</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.750" end="00:52:12.619" style="s2">and being able to hijack that social</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.210" end="00:52:14.210" style="s2">connectivity impulse in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.619" end="00:52:17.029" style="s2">actually drives more and more separation</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.210" end="00:52:20.779" style="s2">mmm-hmm but the gist like I heard you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.029" end="00:52:22.700" style="s2">saying hey we&#39;re filling a void and like</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.779" end="00:52:24.950" style="s2">Gobber Montes work on addiction is such</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.700" end="00:52:27.170" style="s2">such beautiful work that the main cause</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.950" end="00:52:29.359" style="s2">of addiction as he&#39;s looking at it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.170" end="00:52:31.309" style="s2">again it&#39;s easy to want to say the main</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.359" end="00:52:34.009" style="s2">cause of anything and be over reductive</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.309" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">so I&#39;m not I&#39;m not gonna do that but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.009" end="00:52:38.059" style="s2">thing he&#39;s focused on is the main cause</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:41.150" style="s2">of addiction statistically they notice</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.059" end="00:52:45.609" style="s2">is loneliness and when people have deep</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.150" end="00:52:48.859" style="s2">rich connectivity they heal better and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.609" end="00:52:51.069" style="s2">now we I&#39;ll put one more part of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.859" end="00:52:53.720" style="s2">together now curious your thoughts on it</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.069" end="00:52:56.779" style="s2">when we look at this going forward and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.720" end="00:52:58.309" style="s2">we look at the issue of existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.779" end="00:52:59.690" style="s2">catastrophic risk associated with</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.309" end="00:53:02.269" style="s2">exponential tech which is something</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.690" end="00:53:03.500" style="s2">people heard me talk about here right</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.269" end="00:53:06.920" style="s2">now we have the ability for</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.500" end="00:53:09.140" style="s2">someone to go take an ar-15 and shoot up</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.920" end="00:53:11.240" style="s2">a bunch of people right and whenever</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.140" end="00:53:12.470" style="s2">that happens and they interview</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.240" end="00:53:14.270" style="s2">afterwards the neighbors the neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.470" end="00:53:16.910" style="s2">all say yeah we never saw him he kept to</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.270" end="00:53:18.970" style="s2">himself he was a super quiet guy yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.910" end="00:53:20.690" style="s2">have a society where he can progress in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.970" end="00:53:22.040" style="s2">psychopathology because he doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.690" end="00:53:23.870" style="s2">to interact with anyone he can use a</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.040" end="00:53:25.370" style="s2">little money and go buy some food in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.870" end="00:53:27.800" style="s2">store without making eye contact with</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.370" end="00:53:29.210" style="s2">anyone and progress in psychopathology</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.800" end="00:53:29.840" style="s2">then have access to something like an</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.210" end="00:53:31.850" style="s2">ar-15</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.840" end="00:53:34.340" style="s2">but with exponential tech that could be</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.850" end="00:53:35.300" style="s2">access to much more stuff right - drone</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.340" end="00:53:37.190" style="s2">Torme&#39;s - whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.300" end="00:53:38.990" style="s2">like how do you prevent that how do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.190" end="00:53:41.330" style="s2">make a world that is resilient in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.990" end="00:53:43.220" style="s2">presence of that well you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.330" end="00:53:45.170" style="s2">shut-ins right so some people say well</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.220" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">we must have Ubiquiti surveillance well</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.170" end="00:53:48.520" style="s2">that&#39;s already a failed structure if</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s big with surveillance of the state</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.520" end="00:53:53.090" style="s2">but families and communities address the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.680" end="00:53:58.300" style="s2">need of surveillance but in a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.090" end="00:54:01.820" style="s2">way which was through connectivity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.300" end="00:54:04.070" style="s2">yeah so again I want to go two different</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.820" end="00:54:05.810" style="s2">directions with that yeah please</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.070" end="00:54:07.610" style="s2">I did want to go in the economic</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.810" end="00:54:11.120" style="s2">direction and I think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.610" end="00:54:13.610" style="s2">link the idea that I like to define</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.120" end="00:54:15.860" style="s2">addiction as the attempt to meet a need</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.610" end="00:54:17.930" style="s2">with a substitute that doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.860" end="00:54:19.580" style="s2">meet the need and because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.930" end="00:54:23.270" style="s2">meet the need you need more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.580" end="00:54:28.100" style="s2">more of it to temporarily quell the</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.270" end="00:54:31.070" style="s2">longing and I think that on the societal</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.100" end="00:54:33.020" style="s2">level we&#39;re trying to meet the need for</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.070" end="00:54:37.670" style="s2">qualitative things with more and more</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.020" end="00:54:43.250" style="s2">quantity and that ties into the economic</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.670" end="00:54:47.110" style="s2">system because only things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.250" end="00:54:53.810" style="s2">quantified can be easily denominated</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.110" end="00:54:56.390" style="s2">with in money and if that gets a bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.810" end="00:54:58.130" style="s2">complicated I mean obviously things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.390" end="00:55:04.570" style="s2">are not better they&#39;re qualitative or</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.130" end="00:55:06.080" style="s2">still bought and sold for money but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.570" end="00:55:08.540" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.080" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a link there but what I would</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.540" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">really like to explore is Thea</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.610" end="00:55:22.450" style="s2">the second thing that you were just</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:27.380" style="s2">saying loneliness yeah and shut-ins</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.450" end="00:55:30.770" style="s2">right yeah and and surveillance yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.380" end="00:55:32.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s similar to the mindset of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.770" end="00:55:35.450" style="s2">metrics aren&#39;t working so let&#39;s fix the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.660" end="00:55:38.060" style="s2">problem with even more metrics so more</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.450" end="00:55:41.390" style="s2">generally it&#39;s our technologies of of</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.060" end="00:55:44.750" style="s2">control are not working so let&#39;s fix a</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.390" end="00:55:48.140" style="s2">problem by extending the control even</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.750" end="00:55:49.670" style="s2">further so you know we&#39;ve had like so</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.140" end="00:55:52.670" style="s2">you have school shooters you know and</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.670" end="00:55:57.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like well I mean gosh we had our</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.670" end="00:55:58.790" style="s2">our fence around the school we had our</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.290" end="00:56:00.770" style="s2">surveillance system we had our metal</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.790" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">detectors we were locking every door and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.770" end="00:56:05.000" style="s2">the shooter still got in and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">surveilling with students you know and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.000" end="00:56:10.990" style="s2">the student and so it didn&#39;t work so</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:15.560" style="s2">let&#39;s do even more of that whereas in</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.990" end="00:56:19.100" style="s2">the 70s when I was in school we had open</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.560" end="00:56:20.930" style="s2">campus in the high school like all the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.100" end="00:56:22.580" style="s2">doors were open to the community there</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.930" end="00:56:24.590" style="s2">was none of that surveillance stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.580" end="00:56:26.210" style="s2">there were no dogs sniffing the schools</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.590" end="00:56:30.230" style="s2">for weapons there were no cops in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.210" end="00:56:32.690" style="s2">schools and there was even a shooting</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.230" end="00:56:34.370" style="s2">club where the kids could like bring</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.690" end="00:56:37.430" style="s2">their guns to school and like there was</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.370" end="00:56:39.080" style="s2">a shooting club you know or they would</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.430" end="00:56:44.860" style="s2">practice their target practice you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.080" end="00:56:47.420" style="s2">like so it almost seems that that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.860" end="00:56:49.160" style="s2">intensification of control actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.420" end="00:56:51.290" style="s2">creates the conditions where you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.160" end="00:56:53.210" style="s2">shooters it&#39;s like you take an explosive</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.290" end="00:56:55.850" style="s2">force and you confine it in a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.210" end="00:56:59.180" style="s2">and smaller container and what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.850" end="00:57:00.380" style="s2">happen eventually and when the explosion</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.180" end="00:57:04.550" style="s2">happens you say well the container</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.380" end="00:57:06.460" style="s2">wasn&#39;t strong enough so it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.550" end="00:57:08.930" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing something you you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.460" end="00:57:11.150" style="s2">bringing up that you hold an alternate</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.930" end="00:57:15.080" style="s2">view on one of the other most polarizing</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.150" end="00:57:18.620" style="s2">issues which is gun control and because</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.080" end="00:57:20.680" style="s2">you just said we had more access to guns</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.620" end="00:57:23.450" style="s2">and schools unless shooting</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.680" end="00:57:25.519" style="s2">yeah I mean again that is a polarizing</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.450" end="00:57:28.609" style="s2">issue and it&#39;s another issue in which</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.519" end="00:57:30.230" style="s2">the key to the debate I think lies and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.609" end="00:57:34.069" style="s2">what neither side is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.230" end="00:57:36.349" style="s2">I don&#39;t want detour into that because I</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.069" end="00:57:38.990" style="s2">want to say one more thing okay we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.349" end="00:57:40.819" style="s2">wait no I&#39;m wanting to detour not into</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.990" end="00:57:42.259" style="s2">gun control but the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.819" end="00:57:43.460" style="s2">polarization itself but finish</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.259" end="00:57:47.539" style="s2">everywhere and we&#39;ll come back to it</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.460" end="00:57:49.609" style="s2">yeah so so it like the surveillance and</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.539" end="00:57:53.450" style="s2">you said this is what I fought a long</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.609" end="00:57:56.210" style="s2">time there&#39;s with two paths in front of</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.450" end="00:57:58.099" style="s2">us one is increasing government</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.210" end="00:58:00.170" style="s2">surveillance over everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.099" end="00:58:03.259" style="s2">everything and that&#39;s the pathway seem</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.170" end="00:58:06.440" style="s2">to be going on but there&#39;s another path</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.259" end="00:58:10.490" style="s2">which is increasing surveillance of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.440" end="00:58:11.769" style="s2">everybody um on everybody which is also</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.490" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">could be called increasing transparency</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.769" end="00:58:16.759" style="s2">yeah right now we have increasing</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:21.039" style="s2">transparency of the population to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.759" end="00:58:21.039" style="s2">government you know there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.940" end="00:58:27.500" style="s2">possibilities like kind of hints of</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.619" end="00:58:30.109" style="s2">another path which would be and and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.500" end="00:58:31.849" style="s2">comes out in in like the videos of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.109" end="00:58:34.309" style="s2">police brutality and police shootings</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.849" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">like the government is in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.309" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">starting to become more transparent to</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:41.750" style="s2">the people as well or through WikiLeaks</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:45.109" style="s2">things like that if and so for me a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.750" end="00:58:48.740" style="s2">dystopian future is one where the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.109" end="00:58:51.349" style="s2">government total eise&#39;s its surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.740" end="00:58:54.589" style="s2">and control over everybody and the other</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.349" end="00:58:57.230" style="s2">is a utopian future in which everything</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.589" end="00:59:00.079" style="s2">is transparent not to say that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.230" end="00:59:01.819" style="s2">no privacy or whatever but because</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.079" end="00:59:04.099" style="s2">invasions of privacy would be</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.819" end="00:59:05.900" style="s2">transparent to you know there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.099" end="00:59:09.500" style="s2">you know realms and boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.900" end="00:59:11.799" style="s2">things but yeah like if the government</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.500" end="00:59:17.089" style="s2">if every financial transaction were</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.799" end="00:59:21.049" style="s2">transparent which blockchain technology</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.089" end="00:59:26.000" style="s2">offers the possibility of if you can you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.049" end="00:59:28.339" style="s2">know attach a biological identity to a</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.000" end="00:59:30.740" style="s2">wallet etc etc we can&#39;t go into that but</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.339" end="00:59:33.590" style="s2">but like there&#39;s so there&#39;s another path</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.740" end="00:59:35.330" style="s2">that where everything is if</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.590" end="00:59:37.880" style="s2">if all Trent financial transactions were</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.330" end="00:59:38.690" style="s2">transparent boy that would that would</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.880" end="00:59:42.590" style="s2">change everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.690" end="00:59:46.760" style="s2">if all government decision-making were</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.590" end="00:59:49.490" style="s2">transparent if there were no secrets and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.760" end="00:59:51.080" style="s2">so there&#39;s a movement like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.490" end="00:59:52.610" style="s2">there&#39;s two movements in opposite</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.080" end="00:59:55.070" style="s2">directions at the same time one is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.610" end="00:59:58.100" style="s2">toward greater secrecy and greater</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.070" end="01:00:00.200" style="s2">control and and the weaponization of</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.100" end="01:00:02.690" style="s2">narratives and the other is toward</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.200" end="01:00:05.540" style="s2">greater transparency like we hold that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.690" end="01:00:08.560" style="s2">now in our relationships as an important</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.540" end="01:00:12.050" style="s2">virtue to be transparent with each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.560" end="01:00:15.590" style="s2">so yeah those are the two roads ahead of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.050" end="01:00:19.610" style="s2">us I think it&#39;s the bifurcation right</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.590" end="01:00:22.690" style="s2">now the choice that we face and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.610" end="01:00:28.010" style="s2">like these two timelines that both</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.690" end="01:00:32.510" style="s2">converge at the present and I want to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.010" end="01:00:36.620" style="s2">what I can to strengthen the timeline</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.510" end="01:00:39.350" style="s2">toward a more utopian future so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.620" end="01:00:41.590" style="s2">interesting when you&#39;re describing the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.350" end="01:00:45.830" style="s2">difference between transparency and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.590" end="01:00:47.390" style="s2">state-based surveillance a couple kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.830" end="01:00:49.940" style="s2">of like underlying math ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.390" end="01:00:51.650" style="s2">about it one has to do with increasing</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.940" end="01:00:53.330" style="s2">symmetry and the other increasing</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.650" end="01:00:56.270" style="s2">asymmetry of power because the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.330" end="01:00:58.570" style="s2">information becomes power and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.270" end="01:01:01.610" style="s2">have one surveilling everybody and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.570" end="01:01:03.980" style="s2">radical asymmetry then you have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.610" end="01:01:06.350" style="s2">situation that maximizes the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.980" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">for power over dynamics but if you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.350" end="01:01:10.970" style="s2">a situation of everyone being connected</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:12.470" style="s2">to which includes having information</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.970" end="01:01:14.300" style="s2">about everyone then you have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.470" end="01:01:16.160" style="s2">many-to-many transaction rather than a</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.300" end="01:01:18.440" style="s2">one-to-many type dynamic you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.160" end="01:01:20.570" style="s2">cemetery rather than a cemetery and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.440" end="01:01:22.190" style="s2">have decentralization of the information</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.570" end="01:01:23.720" style="s2">processing rather than centralization</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.190" end="01:01:27.830" style="s2">centralization is always going to lead</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.720" end="01:01:31.460" style="s2">to capturing corruption and now this</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.830" end="01:01:34.310" style="s2">brings up your point around restorative</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.460" end="01:01:38.570" style="s2">or regenerative work because that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.310" end="01:01:42.850" style="s2">actually regenerating elements of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.570" end="01:01:46.540" style="s2">human ecology that used to exist more</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.850" end="01:01:52.210" style="s2">like families and communities yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.540" end="01:01:54.130" style="s2">mm-hmm so I want to come to this</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.210" end="01:01:58.500" style="s2">polarization topic because whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.130" end="01:02:00.130" style="s2">talking about climate change or the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.500" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">specifics of weather we do a</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.130" end="01:02:06.670" style="s2">cap-and-trade system or I mean we just</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:10.630" style="s2">started to critique capitalism itself</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.670" end="01:02:14.530" style="s2">right and you we get some of the hottest</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.630" end="01:02:17.530" style="s2">kinds of debates there or any of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.530" end="01:02:22.450" style="s2">issues gun control nationalism we see a</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.530" end="01:02:24.280" style="s2">movement to increasing polarization and</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.450" end="01:02:30.550" style="s2">radicalization around almost everything</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.280" end="01:02:34.900" style="s2">currently and decrease conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.550" end="01:02:36.940" style="s2">quality mm-hm and speak to that a little</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.900" end="01:02:38.890" style="s2">bit because you&#39;re obviously addressing</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.940" end="01:02:41.740" style="s2">that in a lot of areas facing that in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.890" end="01:02:44.950" style="s2">lot of areas what do you what do you see</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.740" end="01:02:47.830" style="s2">are some of the causes or system</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.950" end="01:02:51.310" style="s2">dynamics that give rise to that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.830" end="01:02:53.140" style="s2">gosh I think that polarization is</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.310" end="01:02:57.070" style="s2">actually the biggest problem facing</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.140" end="01:02:59.350" style="s2">civilization right now because if we</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.070" end="01:03:01.960" style="s2">cannot come into coherence and stop</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.350" end="01:03:05.350" style="s2">fighting each other we&#39;re never gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.960" end="01:03:08.230" style="s2">a healing influence on the world when</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.350" end="01:03:10.330" style="s2">the most important goal is to defeat the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.230" end="01:03:13.120" style="s2">enemy everything else becomes</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.330" end="01:03:14.740" style="s2">subservient to that goal and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.120" end="01:03:18.100" style="s2">gonna worry about the environmental</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.740" end="01:03:20.770" style="s2">effects of bombing Iraq which were</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.100" end="01:03:24.790" style="s2">horrendous because you gotta kill the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.770" end="01:03:27.010" style="s2">terrorists you know you gotta win so and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.790" end="01:03:29.020" style="s2">it&#39;s also a matter of priorities and</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.010" end="01:03:33.330" style="s2">where do we put our energy I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.020" end="01:03:36.280" style="s2">imagine what we&#39;d be able to do in</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.330" end="01:03:38.920" style="s2">energy technologies if we took all of</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.280" end="01:03:41.860" style="s2">the scientific talent that&#39;s devoted to</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.920" end="01:03:43.000" style="s2">weapons and turned it toward energy</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.860" end="01:03:45.610" style="s2">storage</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.000" end="01:03:51.040" style="s2">you know batteries making better</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.610" end="01:03:54.550" style="s2">batteries like I mean our problems would</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.040" end="01:03:56.920" style="s2">be solved you know in five years it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.550" end="01:03:59.230" style="s2">can do anything we want we can create</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.920" end="01:04:00.160" style="s2">any world we want if we put our</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.230" end="01:04:02.650" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.160" end="01:04:05.280" style="s2">into it and our imagination into it and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.650" end="01:04:10.510" style="s2">so much of it now it&#39;s siphoned into</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.280" end="01:04:13.660" style="s2">diversions into fighting each other and</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.510" end="01:04:19.750" style="s2">so yeah like like socialism versus</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.660" end="01:04:22.539" style="s2">capitalism that&#39;s a good good one III</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.750" end="01:04:27.819" style="s2">read left wing and right wing websites</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.539" end="01:04:29.670" style="s2">and and some that are hard to tell if</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.819" end="01:04:32.710" style="s2">they&#39;re right wing or left wing because</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.670" end="01:04:34.690" style="s2">of the everything&#39;s turning upside down</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.710" end="01:04:38.170" style="s2">now and the so-called liberals are</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.690" end="01:04:40.450" style="s2">telling us to trust the CIA and and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.170" end="01:04:43.500" style="s2">Conservatives used to be pro war or now</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.450" end="01:04:47.530" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s getting all mixed up but</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.500" end="01:04:51.460" style="s2">some of the libertarian anti-war</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.530" end="01:04:54.160" style="s2">websites that I appreciate are also very</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.460" end="01:04:57.400" style="s2">dismissive and contemptuous of socialism</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.160" end="01:05:01.150" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this polarized socialism</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.400" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">versus capitalism and as usual look at</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.150" end="01:05:06.779" style="s2">what are the hidden agreements and what</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.960" end="01:05:11.260" style="s2">are the questions that are not asked</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.779" end="01:05:14.829" style="s2">well one of them is what is capital what</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.260" end="01:05:16.930" style="s2">is ownership capitalism is supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.829" end="01:05:19.690" style="s2">be about private ownership socialism</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.930" end="01:05:23.410" style="s2">about collective ownership well actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.690" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">this is always a continuum because to</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.410" end="01:05:29.140" style="s2">own something is always a social</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:32.109" style="s2">agreement it&#39;s not that it&#39;s that your</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.140" end="01:05:35.049" style="s2">land or your car or anything is attached</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.109" end="01:05:36.700" style="s2">to your body like what is ownership what</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.049" end="01:05:39.609" style="s2">is capital what is money</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.700" end="01:05:42.220" style="s2">these are all functions of collective</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.609" end="01:05:46.119" style="s2">agreements so to me that the real</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.220" end="01:05:49.210" style="s2">question is is what agreements shall we</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.119" end="01:05:51.730" style="s2">have to that define money and property</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.210" end="01:05:53.770" style="s2">not should it be public or should it be</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.730" end="01:05:55.420" style="s2">private it&#39;s what what are the</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.770" end="01:05:58.210" style="s2">agreements that are consistent with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.420" end="01:06:03.099" style="s2">world that we want to live in and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.210" end="01:06:07.059" style="s2">that leads to what capitalism another</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.099" end="01:06:09.700" style="s2">way to put it is that cap that that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.059" end="01:06:12.059" style="s2">nature and effect of capitalism depends</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.700" end="01:06:14.640" style="s2">on the nature of capital</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.059" end="01:06:18.089" style="s2">and how does capitalism change when</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.640" end="01:06:20.369" style="s2">capital changes and this gets into the</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.089" end="01:06:25.799" style="s2">some of the economic proposals I work</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.369" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">with to change the DNA of money so</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.799" end="01:06:31.259" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s fear I veered off a little</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.319" end="01:06:33.299" style="s2">bit but but yeah so as far as</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.259" end="01:06:36.269" style="s2">polarization goes when the most</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.299" end="01:06:39.449" style="s2">important thing becomes to win over the</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.269" end="01:06:44.189" style="s2">enemy everything else gets sacrificed to</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.449" end="01:06:46.499" style="s2">that including the truth because if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.189" end="01:06:48.390" style="s2">say you get some new information about</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.499" end="01:06:50.609" style="s2">something if you are in the mindset of</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.390" end="01:06:52.680" style="s2">defeating the enemy then the first</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.609" end="01:06:55.259" style="s2">filter that that information passes</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.680" end="01:06:58.380" style="s2">through is not is it true but doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.259" end="01:07:01.680" style="s2">serve the narrative so you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.380" end="01:07:05.579" style="s2">anti-trump and some you know the steel</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.680" end="01:07:06.900" style="s2">dossier comes up and oh yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.579" end="01:07:09.930" style="s2">here&#39;s something we can use to attack</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.900" end="01:07:13.859" style="s2">Donald Trump whether or not it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.930" end="01:07:15.809" style="s2">you don&#39;t if if it&#39;s something that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.859" end="01:07:18.599" style="s2">gonna harm Donald Trump and you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.809" end="01:07:20.910" style="s2">Donald Trump opponent then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.599" end="01:07:23.039" style="s2">gonna scrutinize it too much</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.910" end="01:07:26.910" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna question that source</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.039" end="01:07:32.099" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna tend to accept it even if</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.910" end="01:07:34.199" style="s2">in the back of your mind you you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.099" end="01:07:36.390" style="s2">that it&#39;s not really true you know that</p>

<p begin="01:07:45.269" end="01:07:51.170" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be skeptical of it if they</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.380" end="01:07:54.449" style="s2">weren&#39;t on the other side cuz you cannot</p>

<p begin="01:08:17.159" end="01:08:23.029" style="s2">good guys what&#39;s much more threatening</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.859" end="01:08:27.170" style="s2">than the enemy is the pacifist</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.029" end="01:08:31.600" style="s2">in a time of war it&#39;s the person who</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.170" end="01:08:34.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t participate in the polarization</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.600" end="01:08:38.299" style="s2">because they cast into doubt the very</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.430" end="01:08:40.279" style="s2">premises of of your identity and your</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.299" end="01:08:41.719" style="s2">sense of belonging and I think that one</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.279" end="01:08:44.420" style="s2">reason for the polarization of our</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.719" end="01:08:48.489" style="s2">society is the crisis in belonging and</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.420" end="01:08:51.160" style="s2">the crisis in meaning as the modern</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.489" end="01:08:54.500" style="s2">modernist you know modern in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.160" end="01:09:01.089" style="s2">meaning making apparatus has fallen</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.500" end="01:09:04.160" style="s2">apart and as the the promise of</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.089" end="01:09:06.080" style="s2">technological society to create a utopia</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.160" end="01:09:09.080" style="s2">like that whole narrative that&#39;s fallen</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.080" end="01:09:14.870" style="s2">apart we don&#39;t know who we are anymore</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.080" end="01:09:16.819" style="s2">and and and we don&#39;t and also yeah add</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.870" end="01:09:20.719" style="s2">to that the dissolution of community and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.819" end="01:09:23.029" style="s2">civic culture and the intensifying</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.719" end="01:09:25.480" style="s2">crisis of belonging that makes people</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.029" end="01:09:28.160" style="s2">susceptible to these in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.480" end="01:09:30.109" style="s2">dynamics because they&#39;re offered ah</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.160" end="01:09:32.540" style="s2">here&#39;s a way you can belong here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.109" end="01:09:35.449" style="s2">meaning you can make of your life here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.540" end="01:09:38.540" style="s2">the here&#39;s the way the world is so to</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.449" end="01:09:42.350" style="s2">define ourselves in contrast to an enemy</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.540" end="01:09:44.660" style="s2">that&#39;s like the most simplified form of</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.350" end="01:09:48.680" style="s2">meaning-making that that is available to</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.660" end="01:09:50.989" style="s2">us and yeah and so I agree with you that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.680" end="01:09:53.299" style="s2">it&#39;s really dangerous like this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.989" end="01:09:54.590" style="s2">really disturbing because you said</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.299" end="01:09:57.170" style="s2">something about how it simplifies the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.590" end="01:09:58.790" style="s2">dialogue or destroys the possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.170" end="01:10:01.550" style="s2">conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.790" end="01:10:03.410" style="s2">when truth is sacrificed when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.550" end="01:10:05.660" style="s2">open to new information when every piece</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.410" end="01:10:08.239" style="s2">of information is evaluated on is this</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.660" end="01:10:10.250" style="s2">gonna help us win or not is it gonna</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.239" end="01:10:11.900" style="s2">help make our narrative a better weapon</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.250" end="01:10:16.460" style="s2">then of course there&#39;s no conversation</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.900" end="01:10:18.080" style="s2">to be had yeah yeah so I actually want</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.460" end="01:10:19.960" style="s2">to drill down here the most because when</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.080" end="01:10:23.060" style="s2">you said the biggest issue facing</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.960" end="01:10:26.150" style="s2">civilization is you call it polarization</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.060" end="01:10:28.790" style="s2">you know this is another way of talking</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.150" end="01:10:30.980" style="s2">about when I when I described rivalries</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.790" end="01:10:33.260" style="s2">games and yep I rather escapes</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.980" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">necessarily cause harm to each other and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.260" end="01:10:36.560" style="s2">or the Commons and with exponential tech</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.120" end="01:10:39.410" style="s2">exponential harm is</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.560" end="01:10:43.400" style="s2">so like we either get this now or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.410" end="01:10:45.740" style="s2">the fork in the road our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.400" end="01:10:47.420" style="s2">address any of the issues requires our</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.740" end="01:10:49.340" style="s2">ability to sense make together</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.420" end="01:10:51.110" style="s2">what addressing the issue would actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.340" end="01:10:54.380" style="s2">mean and then our ability to choice make</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.110" end="01:10:56.990" style="s2">together and if that&#39;s broken down then</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.380" end="01:11:01.670" style="s2">failure of everything is eminent right</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.990" end="01:11:02.080" style="s2">and so just as we unpack this a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.670" end="01:11:07.430" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.080" end="01:11:12.200" style="s2">the focus is winning against whoever the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.430" end="01:11:15.140" style="s2">other is and whether that is us versus</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.200" end="01:11:17.150" style="s2">USSR or China or whatever or political</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.140" end="01:11:19.340" style="s2">left versus right or our religion versus</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.150" end="01:11:21.830" style="s2">the other or and then as it starts to</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.340" end="01:11:23.870" style="s2">become about any specific issue right</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.830" end="01:11:26.660" style="s2">those who are for or against a</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.870" end="01:11:29.060" style="s2">particular proposition or who have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.660" end="01:11:30.260" style="s2">particular stance on Me 2 or whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.060" end="01:11:33.740" style="s2">is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.260" end="01:11:36.140" style="s2">climate change obviously and then we go</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.740" end="01:11:38.450" style="s2">to the movies or the TV and we look at</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.140" end="01:11:42.530" style="s2">what we grew up with and almost every</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.450" end="01:11:43.730" style="s2">single movie like unless it&#39;s maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.530" end="01:11:46.820" style="s2">romantic comedy in which case it has</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.730" end="01:11:48.710" style="s2">another bad mean and then we celebrate</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.820" end="01:11:50.240" style="s2">when the bad guy gets it at the end like</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.710" end="01:11:52.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole thing is there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.240" end="01:11:54.770" style="s2">guy vs. a bad guy that built into the</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.460" end="01:11:56.750" style="s2">structure of the hero&#39;s journey and we</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.770" end="01:12:00.710" style="s2">all feel great rejoiced when we finally</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.750" end="01:12:02.570" style="s2">killer her to that guy and we started</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.710" end="01:12:05.240" style="s2">that celebration with hyper normal</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.570" end="01:12:07.910" style="s2">stimuli as little children imprinting</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.240" end="01:12:09.530" style="s2">being able to decouple our well-being</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.910" end="01:12:11.690" style="s2">from someone else as so much and not</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.530" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">just decoupled but antique outlet mm-hm</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.690" end="01:12:16.160" style="s2">and then we look at our relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:17.720" style="s2">sports and we started training that we</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.160" end="01:12:21.530" style="s2">want to be able to celebrate a lot when</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.720" end="01:12:23.090" style="s2">somebody else loses and if I want people</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.530" end="01:12:25.070" style="s2">who will go to war later because war</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.090" end="01:12:29.270" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel good I have to train people</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.070" end="01:12:31.580" style="s2">to have an anti coupled sense of</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.270" end="01:12:33.080" style="s2">identity with others and so we start to</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.580" end="01:12:36.050" style="s2">look at what is a culture that grows up</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.080" end="01:12:38.840" style="s2">with zero-sum sports and where all of</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.050" end="01:12:40.670" style="s2">the movie memes are we win when the bad</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.840" end="01:12:44.170" style="s2">guy gets it and when you start to look</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.670" end="01:12:48.960" style="s2">at how Vic Watase this is it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.170" end="01:12:52.329" style="s2">profound yeah the programming is so deep</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.960" end="01:12:54.699" style="s2">the movies yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.329" end="01:12:57.789" style="s2">the problem in the movie is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.699" end="01:13:00.150" style="s2">this bad guy in the solution you should</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.789" end="01:13:03.369" style="s2">kill the bad guy before you lock him up</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.150" end="01:13:06.550" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s almost ubiquitous it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.369" end="01:13:10.809" style="s2">universal in in action movies very</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.550" end="01:13:13.119" style="s2">rarely is there an exception to it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.809" end="01:13:15.639" style="s2">usually the bad guy loses and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.119" end="01:13:18.579" style="s2">everyone lives happily ever after except</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.639" end="01:13:24.969" style="s2">Ian not what was it Avengers what was a</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.579" end="01:13:29.250" style="s2">thing called God infinity Wars where guy</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.969" end="01:13:34.659" style="s2">actually wins and then it&#39;s dystopian</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.250" end="01:13:36.039" style="s2">yeah right but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s deep deep</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.659" end="01:13:40.349" style="s2">programming and then the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.039" end="01:13:43.960" style="s2">as you mentioned which is about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.349" end="01:13:45.369" style="s2">triumph of the heroic individual and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.960" end="01:13:49.929" style="s2">picture of Luke Skywalker up there</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.369" end="01:13:54.909" style="s2">getting his medal and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.929" end="01:14:00.280" style="s2">the end when actually the hero is a very</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.909" end="01:14:03.760" style="s2">juvenile archetype in in in the lover</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.280" end="01:14:08.409" style="s2">magician warrior king schema it is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.760" end="01:14:10.510" style="s2">immature form of the warrior so very</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.409" end="01:14:14.409" style="s2">very far from being the king which does</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.510" end="01:14:17.230" style="s2">not seek glory for himself but it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.409" end="01:14:21.550" style="s2">secure in his place in the world and so</p>

<p begin="01:14:27.550" end="01:14:33.099" style="s2">anyway okay so this is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.340" end="01:14:36.969" style="s2">now we connect when you said earlier the</p>

<p begin="01:15:10.909" end="01:15:15.380" style="s2">the immature hero&#39;s journey where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.280" end="01:15:17.300" style="s2">seeking identity on the outside and now</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.380" end="01:15:19.039" style="s2">we start to look at polarization and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.300" end="01:15:21.949" style="s2">way that identity is tied to in group</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.039" end="01:15:24.590" style="s2">dynamics in-group out-group dynamics and</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.949" end="01:15:28.369" style="s2">all right so we&#39;re lonely we&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.590" end="01:15:30.380" style="s2">to belong and now I belong by sharing</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.369" end="01:15:32.900" style="s2">the world view of a particular in-group</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.380" end="01:15:34.369" style="s2">and that that group is people who are</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.900" end="01:15:36.079" style="s2">actually very very different but they</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.369" end="01:15:39.099" style="s2">cohere and their other Ness to an out</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.079" end="01:15:41.179" style="s2">group right and then everybody</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.099" end="01:15:42.829" style="s2">normalizes their thinking to whatever</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.179" end="01:15:45.920" style="s2">the center of the standard narrative of</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.829" end="01:15:47.690" style="s2">the in-group is right yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.920" end="01:15:50.659" style="s2">everybody believes that that they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.690" end="01:15:51.229" style="s2">team good and that serving the good of</p>

<p begin="01:15:51.229" end="01:15:58.780" style="s2">and if that&#39;s true then anything that</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.429" end="01:16:03.260" style="s2">you do to gain more power is justified</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.780" end="01:16:06.469" style="s2">George Orwell had very very acute</p>

<p begin="01:16:09.099" end="01:16:23.300" style="s2">but there&#39;s so he talks about power and</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.229" end="01:16:28.610" style="s2">doublethink and that the party on the</p>

<p begin="01:16:35.179" end="01:16:40.550" style="s2">that they seek anything other than power</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.460" end="01:16:42.440" style="s2">but its first own sake and at the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.550" end="01:16:44.630" style="s2">time they hold the contradicted belief</p>

<p begin="01:16:52.370" end="01:17:00.800" style="s2">those two things is that they have no</p>

<p begin="01:18:05.660" end="01:18:14.360" style="s2">gain to overthrow the party and and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.690" end="01:18:16.610" style="s2">this to me is like this distilled</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.360" end="01:18:21.820" style="s2">version of what&#39;s happening with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.610" end="01:18:21.820" style="s2">weaponization of narratives where and</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.090" end="01:18:27.260" style="s2">sometimes I get the sense that that the</p>

<p begin="01:18:27.260" end="01:18:33.410" style="s2">actually believe what they&#39;re saying on</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.620" end="01:18:36.530" style="s2">some level but they have to pretend to</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.410" end="01:18:39.050" style="s2">believe and that pretense has to even</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.530" end="01:18:43.180" style="s2">fool themselves so that they can exhibit</p>

<p begin="01:18:52.160" end="01:18:56.900" style="s2">read another little passage from Orwell</p>

<p begin="01:18:56.900" end="01:19:00.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like a textbook ah</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.760" end="01:19:14.120" style="s2">example of doublethink and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.980" end="01:19:19.010" style="s2">that like we all recognize the brook is</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.120" end="01:19:22.040" style="s2">so prophetic to tell deliberate lies</p>

<p begin="01:19:36.860" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">denies all of this is indispensably</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.700" end="01:19:46.970" style="s2">necessary and it goes on to know and not</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.960" end="01:19:48.560" style="s2">to know to be conscious of complete</p>

<p begin="01:19:55.550" end="01:20:04.690" style="s2">in both of them okay anyway I could go</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.310" end="01:20:08.530" style="s2">on but but um it just gives me chills</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.690" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">that someone could be so so prophetic</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.530" end="01:20:15.200" style="s2">well this is not a new phenomena right</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:18.440" style="s2">if we go back to the court of Versailles</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.200" end="01:20:20.090" style="s2">and the way the politic dynamics worked</p>

<p begin="01:20:45.550" end="01:20:50.150" style="s2">so the group would always cleave when it</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.100" end="01:20:52.640" style="s2">would get larger than that because</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.150" end="01:20:54.350" style="s2">nobody if they if the group gets so</p>

<p begin="01:21:37.160" end="01:21:40.910" style="s2">gonna separate into small little tribes</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.170" end="01:21:42.469" style="s2">that get along well where they have</p>

<p begin="01:21:44.060" end="01:21:49.070" style="s2">unite is having a larger external enemy</p>

<p begin="01:23:05.270" end="01:23:12.560" style="s2">and I guess what I&#39;m proposing and not</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.710" end="01:23:15.469" style="s2">certainly not me alone proposing but but</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.560" end="01:23:19.460" style="s2">the story I would say that wants to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.469" end="01:23:21.440" style="s2">born now is a story of we&#39;re here to</p>

<p begin="01:23:21.440" end="01:23:25.360" style="s2">earth and then to participate in the</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.360" end="01:23:33.190" style="s2">dream of the planet in partnership with</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.750" end="01:23:35.860" style="s2">a living earth that feels pretty</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.190" end="01:23:38.050" style="s2">exciting to me and I think even without</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.860" end="01:23:39.700" style="s2">that story being fully conscious alot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.050" end="01:23:42.700" style="s2">people are already gravitating toward</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.700" end="01:23:45.300" style="s2">that like the really intelligent dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.700" end="01:23:47.830" style="s2">young people that I know they are</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.300" end="01:23:51.820" style="s2">generally speaking way more interested</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.830" end="01:23:55.210" style="s2">in you know permaculture design rather</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.820" end="01:24:02.590" style="s2">than nuclear engineering or rocket</p>

<p begin="01:24:06.370" end="01:24:16.720" style="s2">forgive me for being optimistic so if we</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.320" end="01:24:21.450" style="s2">come back to how easy in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.720" end="01:24:26.500" style="s2">and identification is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.450" end="01:24:28.510" style="s2">necessarily destructive that we you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.500" end="01:24:31.750" style="s2">I&#39;ll actually construct this a tiny bit</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.510" end="01:24:34.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember who won founding</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.750" end="01:24:37.960" style="s2">fathers had a statement that was</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.480" end="01:24:40.080" style="s2">something like voting is we&#39;ve discussed</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.960" end="01:24:43.570" style="s2">this voting is the death of democracy</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.080" end="01:24:45.490" style="s2">because the key insight into a democracy</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.570" end="01:24:47.020" style="s2">working well was actually the quality of</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.490" end="01:24:48.820" style="s2">conversation that happened in the Town</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.020" end="01:24:50.410" style="s2">Hall and it was only if we couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.820" end="01:24:52.180" style="s2">a good enough conversation that led to a</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.410" end="01:24:55.540" style="s2">synergistic satisfier for everyone that</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.180" end="01:24:57.220" style="s2">we were stuck with a boat and but we</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.540" end="01:25:00.820" style="s2">don&#39;t even have that conversational</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.220" end="01:25:03.730" style="s2">process to say can we collectively sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.820" end="01:25:06.070" style="s2">make the choice we have here and what</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.730" end="01:25:07.930" style="s2">are all the values that matter what are</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.070" end="01:25:09.460" style="s2">all the pieces of data that mattered</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.930" end="01:25:11.650" style="s2">that every different sense maker has a</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.460" end="01:25:14.500" style="s2">novel perspective on and what would a</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.650" end="01:25:17.140" style="s2">good proposition even be we go straight</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.500" end="01:25:19.660" style="s2">to here&#39;s a proposition that some very</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.140" end="01:25:21.040" style="s2">limited percentage of the population who</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.660" end="01:25:24.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t have all the values and all the</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.040" end="01:25:26.080" style="s2">data clear made and then we get this</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.610" end="01:25:27.790" style="s2">binary choice of yes or no in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.080" end="01:25:29.590" style="s2">proposition the proposition is always</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.790" end="01:25:33.100" style="s2">based on a theory of trade-offs because</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.590" end="01:25:35.040" style="s2">in benefiting that one thing if prop aid</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.100" end="01:25:37.600" style="s2">goes through it&#39;ll damage other things</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.040" end="01:25:38.170" style="s2">which is why everybody doesn&#39;t vote for</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.600" end="01:25:41.140" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.170" end="01:25:43.540" style="s2">and now so the process of voting itself</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.140" end="01:25:46.510" style="s2">ends up being necessarily polarizing</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.540" end="01:25:48.310" style="s2">right and the idea that we go straight</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.510" end="01:25:49.960" style="s2">to choice making before sense making</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.310" end="01:25:52.120" style="s2">what a good choice would even be is kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.960" end="01:25:53.650" style="s2">of ridiculous and you know like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.120" end="01:25:55.300" style="s2">what we think of civic engagement which</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.650" end="01:25:59.980" style="s2">is actually a form of frame control</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.300" end="01:26:03.010" style="s2">right but now rather than those of us</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.980" end="01:26:04.540" style="s2">who want the proposition versus those of</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.010" end="01:26:05.770" style="s2">you who don&#39;t want the proposition being</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.540" end="01:26:07.570" style="s2">able to work together to what a good</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.770" end="01:26:08.980" style="s2">proposition would be we need to spend</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.570" end="01:26:10.179" style="s2">most of our time fighting each other</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.980" end="01:26:11.890" style="s2">because you&#39;re the bad guy because I</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.179" end="01:26:13.540" style="s2">want the proposition to go through that</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.890" end="01:26:14.980" style="s2">allows better jobs cuz my kids can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.540" end="01:26:16.929" style="s2"> get jobs right now and you want</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.980" end="01:26:18.670" style="s2">to protect the damn owls and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.929" end="01:26:19.929" style="s2">proposition is structured in such a way</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.670" end="01:26:23.489" style="s2">that if you get what you want for the</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.929" end="01:26:27.219" style="s2">house my kids can&#39;t eat and if I get</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.489" end="01:26:28.630" style="s2">what-what I want the nature that sacred</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.219" end="01:26:30.910" style="s2">to you dies but it was just because of a</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.630" end="01:26:32.170" style="s2">shitty proposition where had we done a</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.910" end="01:26:33.760" style="s2">better job of trying to say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.170" end="01:26:35.290" style="s2">meaningful to everyone can we craft a</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.760" end="01:26:38.469" style="s2">better synergistic satisfier we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.290" end="01:26:40.390" style="s2">probably come up with things right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.469" end="01:26:41.949" style="s2">certainly because if that&#39;s the choice</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.390" end="01:26:44.800" style="s2">presented to us then</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.949" end="01:26:48.760" style="s2">then there&#39;s it&#39;s inevitable that people</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.800" end="01:26:51.160" style="s2">will cleave into opposing camps when the</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.760" end="01:26:53.110" style="s2">and and prevent that from happening like</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.160" end="01:26:58.390" style="s2">you say there has to be a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.110" end="01:27:00.790" style="s2">that transcends that setup it&#39;s a setup</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.390" end="01:27:05.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a polarizing setup and</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.790" end="01:27:08.230" style="s2">looks at well what is the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.440" end="01:27:11.670" style="s2">system that constantly asks us to</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.230" end="01:27:13.989" style="s2">sacrifice nature for the sake of jobs</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.670" end="01:27:16.870" style="s2">and does it have to be that way and is</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.989" end="01:27:18.429" style="s2">there another kind of system that place</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.870" end="01:27:20.770" style="s2">can only be reached through a</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.429" end="01:27:22.989" style="s2">conversation where each side is willing</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.770" end="01:27:25.239" style="s2">to let go of some of their</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.989" end="01:27:27.940" style="s2">preconceptions some of their identity</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.239" end="01:27:29.980" style="s2">with their opinions conversation is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.940" end="01:27:33.880" style="s2">only way to get there and a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.980" end="01:27:36.969" style="s2">that isn&#39;t debate a lot of what passes</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.880" end="01:27:38.980" style="s2">for conversation is or with the</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.969" end="01:27:41.380" style="s2">political system holds as a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.980" end="01:27:42.480" style="s2">is a debate you know the presidential</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.380" end="01:27:45.190" style="s2">candidates they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.480" end="01:27:47.440" style="s2">conversation to have a debate which side</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.190" end="01:27:50.230" style="s2">wins and</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.440" end="01:27:53.380" style="s2">debate doesn&#39;t get you to anywhere new</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.230" end="01:27:56.440" style="s2">all it does is help one side win over</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.380" end="01:27:58.690" style="s2">the other for for a conversation to</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.440" end="01:28:01.230" style="s2">happen genuine conversation there has to</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.690" end="01:28:02.590" style="s2">be some degree of humility or</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.230" end="01:28:04.840" style="s2">non-attachment</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.590" end="01:28:08.440" style="s2">to an opinion you&#39;ve identified with</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.840" end="01:28:12.070" style="s2">where at least awareness that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.440" end="01:28:15.340" style="s2">identified with an opinion and you</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.070" end="01:28:16.840" style="s2">actually wish that people would study</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.340" end="01:28:21.909" style="s2">this part of American history and</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.840" end="01:28:24.250" style="s2">Western history of like so the when you</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.909" end="01:28:25.719" style="s2">think of the founding fathers setting</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.250" end="01:28:27.310" style="s2">the country up there&#39;s obviously plenty</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.719" end="01:28:31.179" style="s2">that retrospectively we can criticize</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.310" end="01:28:33.900" style="s2">about that but the meaningful advance in</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.179" end="01:28:37.409" style="s2">social structures that did occur there</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.900" end="01:28:39.790" style="s2">occurred because those people were</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.409" end="01:28:41.560" style="s2">products of the Enlightenment they were</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.790" end="01:28:44.170" style="s2">all people that were studied in</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.560" end="01:28:46.989" style="s2">economics and ecology and agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.170" end="01:28:49.810" style="s2">and natural philosophy and the sciences</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.989" end="01:28:51.610" style="s2">and they were all trained in dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.810" end="01:28:52.719" style="s2">and you&#39;d see the letters that they</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.610" end="01:28:55.330" style="s2">would write to each other and there were</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.719" end="01:28:57.969" style="s2">these like profoundly thoughtful nuanced</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.330" end="01:29:01.570" style="s2">respectful types of letters and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.969" end="01:29:02.739" style="s2">nature of the conversation and so they</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.570" end="01:29:04.179" style="s2">would have a conversation where they</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.739" end="01:29:06.100" style="s2">would actually listen and learn from</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.179" end="01:29:08.260" style="s2">each other Rachele collective sense</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.100" end="01:29:10.090" style="s2">making was happening and they made a</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.260" end="01:29:12.400" style="s2">system that works for people like them</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.090" end="01:29:14.760" style="s2">and this is why they said we&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.400" end="01:29:16.840" style="s2">you a republic if you can keep it and</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.760" end="01:29:18.340" style="s2">education and civics have to be the</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.840" end="01:29:20.920" style="s2">center of keeping it because if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.340" end="01:29:23.230" style="s2">don&#39;t really engage in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.920" end="01:29:24.690" style="s2">and civics then you are consenting to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.230" end="01:29:27.639" style="s2">governed by those who will to power</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.690" end="01:29:29.469" style="s2">which is exactly what happens and if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.639" end="01:29:31.270" style="s2">go back to where all of the knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.469" end="01:29:33.699" style="s2">was generated in the Greeks it was again</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.270" end="01:29:35.739" style="s2">because of the orientation towards</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.699" end="01:29:39.130" style="s2">quality of conversation and dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.739" end="01:29:41.489" style="s2">and so you say we have to have real</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.130" end="01:29:43.330" style="s2">conversation that doesn&#39;t just mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.489" end="01:29:44.800" style="s2">conversation with people that already</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.330" end="01:29:51.940" style="s2">hold the same views as you think</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.800" end="01:29:54.460" style="s2">reinforce your cognitive bias yep so how</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.940" end="01:29:58.440" style="s2">so how we changed the system writ large</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.460" end="01:30:00.780" style="s2">is a big topic</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.440" end="01:30:02.730" style="s2">you already said what the for kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.780" end="01:30:04.380" style="s2">pillars for environmental focus you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.730" end="01:30:05.820" style="s2">like the world to be focused on when I</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.380" end="01:30:07.710" style="s2">think they&#39;re actually very good for</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.820" end="01:30:10.410" style="s2">pillars but on this topic of</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.710" end="01:30:12.510" style="s2">polarization and sense making what are</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.410" end="01:30:14.850" style="s2">some things that just listeners can</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.510" end="01:30:20.160" style="s2">start to implement to move in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.850" end="01:30:23.220" style="s2">direction of addressing those issues at</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.160" end="01:30:32.430" style="s2">least in their own life and locally yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.220" end="01:30:38.460" style="s2">I think one thing that&#39;s useful is to</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.430" end="01:30:42.270" style="s2">start noticing our own tendencies to to</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.460" end="01:30:47.850" style="s2">engage in this kind of debate in this</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.270" end="01:30:51.450" style="s2">kind of will to dominate the other to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.850" end="01:30:53.880" style="s2">right to notice to like to become aware</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.450" end="01:30:56.940" style="s2">of our own cognitive biases of our own</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.880" end="01:31:00.690" style="s2">confirmation bias for example like do</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.940" end="01:31:04.440" style="s2">you if you read something that disagrees</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.690" end="01:31:06.930" style="s2">with you how do you deal with that are</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.440" end="01:31:09.690" style="s2">you open to being wrong or are you gonna</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.930" end="01:31:12.870" style="s2">find some way to demonstrate that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.690" end="01:31:17.660" style="s2">been right all along most people are</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.870" end="01:31:21.900" style="s2">gonna like like this came up oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.660" end="01:31:24.690" style="s2">what was it oh yeah I mean here talk</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.900" end="01:31:28.980" style="s2">about a polarizing issue the Mago teen</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.690" end="01:31:31.800" style="s2">you know in his confrontation with that</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.980" end="01:31:34.700" style="s2">Native American guy and like you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.800" end="01:31:37.050" style="s2">then there&#39;s this and there&#39;s this video</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.700" end="01:31:39.570" style="s2">that shows that there&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.050" end="01:31:41.730" style="s2">more to the story and then you know and</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.570" end="01:31:43.110" style="s2">then I just looked at I just looked at a</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.730" end="01:31:44.520" style="s2">little bit of this on Facebook or</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.110" end="01:31:46.860" style="s2">whatever and then this guy says but that</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.520" end="01:31:49.740" style="s2">video came from this notorious</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.860" end="01:31:52.020" style="s2">right-wing propaganda site so shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.740" end="01:31:55.710" style="s2">pay attention to that yeah like find</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.020" end="01:31:57.930" style="s2">some way to exclude data points that</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.710" end="01:32:02.430" style="s2">don&#39;t fit into your narrative but do you</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.930" end="01:32:05.130" style="s2">do that and if so why why is it</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.430" end="01:32:09.000" style="s2">important like I think that in order for</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.130" end="01:32:11.500" style="s2">us to be catalyzers of a different kind</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.000" end="01:32:13.450" style="s2">of conversation we have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.500" end="01:32:17.130" style="s2">bhadiya embody and exemplify it</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.450" end="01:32:20.290" style="s2">ourselves then it becomes infectious</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.130" end="01:32:23.550" style="s2">because if you approach somebody with a</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.290" end="01:32:28.170" style="s2">willingness to listen a willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.550" end="01:32:32.730" style="s2">be wrong willingness to learn that</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.170" end="01:32:34.780" style="s2">itself is an anomalous data point mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.730" end="01:32:36.310" style="s2">because you don&#39;t encounter that very</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.780" end="01:32:38.610" style="s2">much and so it&#39;s an invitation for</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.310" end="01:32:43.930" style="s2">somebody else to join you in that</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.610" end="01:32:46.900" style="s2">because people are defensive especially</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.930" end="01:32:49.870" style="s2">people who have a strong intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.900" end="01:32:54.490" style="s2">attachment to their opinions in other</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.870" end="01:32:56.980" style="s2">words educated people people feel maybe</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.490" end="01:32:58.780" style="s2">because an attack on your opinion is an</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.980" end="01:33:01.270" style="s2">attack on you if you&#39;re identified with</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.780" end="01:33:06.070" style="s2">it and if it&#39;s part of you being in team</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.270" end="01:33:10.570" style="s2">in team good and right and good so it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.070" end="01:33:12.220" style="s2">a peace offering to tell listen to</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.570" end="01:33:14.380" style="s2">somebody and an invitation into peace</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.220" end="01:33:16.780" style="s2">okay you actually said something there</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.380" end="01:33:19.540" style="s2">that addresses one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.780" end="01:33:23.710" style="s2">this is hard so he said notice our own</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.540" end="01:33:28.120" style="s2">confirmation bias and seek to get more</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.710" end="01:33:30.730" style="s2">earnest seek to be willing to listen and</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.120" end="01:33:33.070" style="s2">inquire and learn new things and and</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.730" end="01:33:34.990" style="s2">update our views which looks like saying</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.070" end="01:33:37.630" style="s2">hey I was wrong or at least incomplete</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.990" end="01:33:39.640" style="s2">about that yeah and separate our</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.630" end="01:33:41.800" style="s2">identity from our views so that our</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.640" end="01:33:44.620" style="s2">views can change and we don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.800" end="01:33:47.320" style="s2">personal ego offense now one of the when</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.620" end="01:33:50.310" style="s2">you said identity connected to team</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.320" end="01:33:54.280" style="s2">right in-group identity structure I am a</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.310" end="01:33:54.940" style="s2">trump supporter I am a trump hate or</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.280" end="01:33:58.750" style="s2">whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.940" end="01:34:01.320" style="s2">now the in-group out-group dynamics do a</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.750" end="01:34:03.730" style="s2">good job of keeping people from leaving</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.320" end="01:34:06.700" style="s2">through social pressure that says you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.730" end="01:34:11.860" style="s2">either with us or against us yep and so</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.700" end="01:34:13.210" style="s2">if you&#39;re willing to engage in listening</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.860" end="01:34:14.830" style="s2">to the people on the other side at all</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.210" end="01:34:17.410" style="s2">you&#39;re not with us you&#39;re against us and</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.830" end="01:34:19.420" style="s2">you just lost all your friends yep even</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.410" end="01:34:22.420" style="s2">to listen to the other side is an act of</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.420" end="01:34:23.470" style="s2">betrayal yeah and so you now get</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.420" end="01:34:25.180" style="s2">villainized</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.470" end="01:34:28.140" style="s2">and you know let&#39;s let</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.180" end="01:34:30.730" style="s2">say that you&#39;re willing to hear</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.140" end="01:34:33.130" style="s2">perspectives of scientists that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.730" end="01:34:35.020" style="s2">think climate changes mostly from</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.130" end="01:34:36.670" style="s2">anthropogenic co2 and is a major issue</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.020" end="01:34:41.140" style="s2">or whatever it is if you&#39;re even willing</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.670" end="01:34:43.210" style="s2">to listen to that you are a direct</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.140" end="01:34:48.220" style="s2">threat to what matters most to all life</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.210" end="01:34:51.580" style="s2">and survival right right and so what can</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.220" end="01:34:55.480" style="s2">you say to the courage it takes or how</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.580" end="01:34:57.880" style="s2">you process the loss of identity and</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.480" end="01:35:06.450" style="s2">in-group in a place where propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.880" end="01:35:13.770" style="s2">narrative warfare is ubiquitous yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.450" end="01:35:13.770" style="s2">where does that courage come from I</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.930" end="01:35:23.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.290" end="01:35:29.170" style="s2">I think courage comes from the</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.500" end="01:35:34.300" style="s2">experience of unconditional love if I</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.170" end="01:35:37.600" style="s2">have experienced that I&#39;m loved for</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.300" end="01:35:40.330" style="s2">myself and not because I meet some kind</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.600" end="01:35:47.260" style="s2">of qualification then I&#39;m not risking as</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.330" end="01:35:50.610" style="s2">much by violating social norms or norms</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.260" end="01:35:55.660" style="s2">of a particular in-group I have a</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.610" end="01:35:57.640" style="s2">solidity in myself that that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.660" end="01:36:00.730" style="s2">yeah okay I don&#39;t care that much fun</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.640" end="01:36:03.370" style="s2">rejected but I don&#39;t want to trivialize</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.730" end="01:36:07.540" style="s2">it in that way it&#39;s it&#39;s I mean there</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.370" end="01:36:10.270" style="s2">can be real consequences toward I mean</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.540" end="01:36:11.830" style="s2">there&#39;s certain opinions that I have or</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.270" end="01:36:13.720" style="s2">even not opinions that I have even</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.830" end="01:36:16.960" style="s2">certain like you were saying like even</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.720" end="01:36:20.400" style="s2">to countenance the the possibility that</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.960" end="01:36:23.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a valid alternative viewpoint</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.400" end="01:36:24.510" style="s2">um there are certain issues where if I</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.460" end="01:36:30.179" style="s2">do that publicly</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.510" end="01:36:32.190" style="s2">I could lose half my audience yeah like</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.179" end="01:36:33.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t even want to name them but I</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.190" end="01:36:36.659" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe I will because like I</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.960" end="01:36:38.100" style="s2">just have this kind of attitude</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.659" end="01:36:41.219" style="s2">I like mature if it&#39;s a good thing but</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.100" end="01:36:44.400" style="s2">you know if I say if I said hey vaccines</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.219" end="01:36:46.260" style="s2">like there&#39;s validity to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.400" end="01:36:51.719" style="s2">criticisms of vaccines or climate change</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.260" end="01:36:55.830" style="s2">or so so since you did it you just you</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.719" end="01:36:58.500" style="s2">just went to maybe the most polarized</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.830" end="01:37:04.380" style="s2">issue in a particular perspective there</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.500" end="01:37:06.510" style="s2">is that I say something about the</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.380" end="01:37:12.239" style="s2">inadequacy of the epistemic process</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.510" end="01:37:15.900" style="s2">that&#39;s connected to this so anti-vaxxer</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.239" end="01:37:17.580" style="s2">is a word that is designed to bring as</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.900" end="01:37:18.900" style="s2">much kind of negative sentiment as</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.580" end="01:37:21.270" style="s2">possible that someone must have</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.900" end="01:37:23.310" style="s2">shit-for-brains to right like believe</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.270" end="01:37:24.870" style="s2">conspiracy theories and nonsense and</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.310" end="01:37:26.219" style="s2">they don&#39;t know science and they want to</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.870" end="01:37:30.300" style="s2">damage the herd immunity and have</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.219" end="01:37:35.929" style="s2">everyone get smallpox and you know and</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.300" end="01:37:39.300" style="s2">yet that&#39;s why I&#39;m anti backs and plan</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.929" end="01:37:41.310" style="s2">this thing&#39;s so ignorant of actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.300" end="01:37:43.949" style="s2">not gonna say I&#39;m anti Beck&#39;s I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.310" end="01:37:47.210" style="s2">saying okay right so then you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.949" end="01:37:51.300" style="s2">other side that says no the vaccines are</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.210" end="01:37:53.489" style="s2">exclusively created to mind-control the</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.300" end="01:37:58.050" style="s2">whole population by the evil Pharma deep</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.489" end="01:37:59.310" style="s2">state complex as part of their eugenics</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.050" end="01:38:05.179" style="s2">plan or whatever the it is right</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.310" end="01:38:09.300" style="s2">and so we can see like ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.179" end="01:38:12.750" style="s2">polarization and but then we say wait</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.300" end="01:38:14.250" style="s2">are all of the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.750" end="01:38:15.660" style="s2">events develop nations in the world</p>

<p begin="01:38:15.660" end="01:38:22.250" style="s2">schedule no they don&#39;t have an identical</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.300" end="01:38:25.590" style="s2">vaccine schedule so that must mean that</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.250" end="01:38:29.460" style="s2">earnest regulators in Denmark and in</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.590" end="01:38:31.290" style="s2">Japan and in different places it</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.460" end="01:38:34.590" style="s2">associated with earnest doctors and</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.290" end="01:38:36.120" style="s2">researchers said the conclusion that say</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.590" end="01:38:38.010" style="s2">the u.s. came up with is not the only</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.120" end="01:38:41.190" style="s2">conclusion on the topic all right well</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.010" end="01:38:43.890" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting and then to even say</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.190" end="01:38:45.900" style="s2">vaccine as one thing to say like okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.890" end="01:38:48.390" style="s2">the smallpox vaccine and the flu vaccine</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.900" end="01:38:51.570" style="s2">and the Gardasil vaccine or however or</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.390" end="01:38:54.060" style="s2">I&#39;m against all vaccines versus some or</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.570" end="01:38:58.710" style="s2">at what times are at what load and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.060" end="01:39:01.890" style="s2">can see that like when I&#39;ve looked into</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.710" end="01:39:06.240" style="s2">this topic and I haven&#39;t looked into it</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.890" end="01:39:09.990" style="s2">deeply enough I&#39;m pretty sure that I</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.240" end="01:39:11.490" style="s2">would come to a very nuanced complex</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.990" end="01:39:14.130" style="s2">view that doesn&#39;t fit into any of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.490" end="01:39:16.110" style="s2">norming views like if you have the</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.130" end="01:39:17.820" style="s2">marisol that is mercury based in it and</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.110" end="01:39:19.650" style="s2">you don&#39;t need it in and their problems</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.820" end="01:39:21.330" style="s2">associate with that you get it out the</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.650" end="01:39:23.760" style="s2">same vaccine might not be as problematic</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.330" end="01:39:26.790" style="s2">if someone has genetics that orient</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.760" end="01:39:29.160" style="s2">themselves towards th1 th2 imbalances if</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.790" end="01:39:31.530" style="s2">we look at how many shots happen at once</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.160" end="01:39:34.680" style="s2">or which type of shots and so to even</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.530" end="01:39:37.200" style="s2">make it I&#39;m Pro or against vaccine means</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.680" end="01:39:39.680" style="s2">that you just had to stop thinking right</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.200" end="01:39:42.090" style="s2">but to introduce thinking into it um</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.680" end="01:39:44.370" style="s2">will harm the narrative of both sides</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.090" end="01:39:48.330" style="s2">right nobody is gonna welcome what</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.370" end="01:39:50.250" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and so I can I can refute</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.330" end="01:39:53.190" style="s2">you easily what you said is very logical</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.250" end="01:39:55.830" style="s2">but I can refute you by saying four legs</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.190" end="01:40:01.080" style="s2">good two legs bad four legs good two</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.830" end="01:40:03.840" style="s2">legs bad conversation is over yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.080" end="01:40:06.890" style="s2">so this is now here&#39;s one of the big</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.840" end="01:40:09.090" style="s2">points in polarization that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.890" end="01:40:12.980" style="s2">like is maybe the most concerning thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.090" end="01:40:15.390" style="s2">to me is if I look at a town hall in the</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.980" end="01:40:17.370" style="s2">early phase of this country or I look at</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.390" end="01:40:20.460" style="s2">a Greek dialectic they were long</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.370" end="01:40:23.280" style="s2">conversations yeah they were not short</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.460" end="01:40:25.410" style="s2">conversations and there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.280" end="01:40:26.489" style="s2">updated view on every one side there was</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.410" end="01:40:29.360" style="s2">a lot of nuance</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.489" end="01:40:35.070" style="s2">perspectives that ended up mattering and</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.360" end="01:40:37.730" style="s2">if I look at the bit size the small bit</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.070" end="01:40:40.380" style="s2">size that increasing hyper normals</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.730" end="01:40:43.440" style="s2">stimuli decreased attention span allows</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.380" end="01:40:47.429" style="s2">I cannot put a nuanced perspective in a</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.440" end="01:40:50.070" style="s2">tweet right or in a snapchat or and so</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.429" end="01:40:52.920" style="s2">the the movement towards me and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.070" end="01:40:54.929" style="s2">going to get more clicks if it hi Jax</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.920" end="01:40:58.159" style="s2">your limbic nervous system more right</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.929" end="01:41:01.530" style="s2">and so there is a kind of platform based</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.159" end="01:41:05.880" style="s2">disposition towards more and more</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.530" end="01:41:07.769" style="s2">inflammatory shorter and shorter pieces</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.880" end="01:41:09.719" style="s2">of information which will automatically</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.769" end="01:41:11.429" style="s2">move everyone towards radicalization of</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.719" end="01:41:12.960" style="s2">every view it&#39;ll make the left more</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.429" end="01:41:16.739" style="s2">radically left to right more ethically</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.960" end="01:41:18.570" style="s2">right and everybody&#39;s stupider right so</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.739" end="01:41:20.039" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s more pissed off right and</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.570" end="01:41:23.880" style="s2">as you say it&#39;s built into the platform</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.039" end="01:41:26.909" style="s2">and in the incentive structures of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.880" end="01:41:31.460" style="s2">platform and also programmed again into</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.909" end="01:41:34.920" style="s2">children in a very young age as as</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.460" end="01:41:38.610" style="s2">children&#39;s cartoons and and programming</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.920" end="01:41:42.659" style="s2">and movies thanks to technology have</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.610" end="01:41:46.050" style="s2">become more and more fragmented you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.659" end="01:41:48.239" style="s2">one intense stimuli after another after</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.050" end="01:41:49.650" style="s2">another one intense stimulus after</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.239" end="01:41:52.380" style="s2">another after another after another a</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.650" end="01:41:53.610" style="s2">rapid montage of intense scenes where</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.380" end="01:41:57.929" style="s2">the future of the universe is at stake</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.610" end="01:42:01.249" style="s2">every two minutes they used to be really</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.929" end="01:42:05.269" style="s2">expensive to make programs like that</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.249" end="01:42:08.070" style="s2">only advertising had such a rapid</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.269" end="01:42:10.699" style="s2">transition from one attention in</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.070" end="01:42:13.829" style="s2">grabbing there&#39;s a technical word for it</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.699" end="01:42:17.369" style="s2">they get keys into the orientation</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.829" end="01:42:20.579" style="s2">response where it&#39;s like a deep</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.369" end="01:42:22.769" style="s2">neurological principle that if something</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.579" end="01:42:24.690" style="s2">new comes into your environment you</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.769" end="01:42:29.249" style="s2">better pay attention to that could be a</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.690" end="01:42:32.880" style="s2">leopard right and so you hold attention</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.249" end="01:42:34.590" style="s2">by presenting one new thing after</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.880" end="01:42:35.980" style="s2">another after another every one to two</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.590" end="01:42:41.200" style="s2">seconds</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.980" end="01:42:45.550" style="s2">and then the attention span atrophies</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.200" end="01:42:49.110" style="s2">and people become cognitively unable to</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.550" end="01:42:53.080" style="s2">even hold attention for long enough to</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.110" end="01:42:55.150" style="s2">absorb and integrate a nuanced view okay</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.080" end="01:42:56.470" style="s2">you just said you just said it in a very</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.150" end="01:42:59.290" style="s2">interesting way you said it atrophies</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.470" end="01:43:02.890" style="s2">and they become unable this is from</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.290" end="01:43:05.680" style="s2"> key right which is I I have to</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.890" end="01:43:07.390" style="s2">work out to gain muscle I have to keep</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.680" end="01:43:09.420" style="s2">working out to maintain the muscle I</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.390" end="01:43:14.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do anything to lose muscle</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.420" end="01:43:16.810" style="s2">right and basically hormesis the the</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.440" end="01:43:19.030" style="s2">nature of adaptive systems to need to</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.810" end="01:43:21.610" style="s2">continue to be stressed to maintain an</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.030" end="01:43:24.610" style="s2">adaptive response to it this applies to</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.610" end="01:43:27.850" style="s2">cognitive and emotional capacities as</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.610" end="01:43:31.180" style="s2">much as it does to muscle and so if I</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.850" end="01:43:33.250" style="s2">don&#39;t if I don&#39;t lift an amount of</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.180" end="01:43:35.980" style="s2">weight where I feel it in my muscle that</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.250" end="01:43:38.860" style="s2">means I&#39;m not up regulating new choice</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.980" end="01:43:40.660" style="s2">anthesis if I don&#39;t engage my attention</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.860" end="01:43:43.720" style="s2">span long enough that it takes working</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.660" end="01:43:46.420" style="s2">to engage it my attention span will be</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.720" end="01:43:47.860" style="s2">decreasing by entropy yeah so if you</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.420" end="01:43:50.320" style="s2">want to work out read something</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.860" end="01:43:53.140" style="s2">published in the 19th century yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.320" end="01:43:55.420" style="s2">the paragraphs are longer the sentences</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.140" end="01:43:56.590" style="s2">are longer it&#39;s like it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.420" end="01:43:58.800" style="s2">understand it you have to really work</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.590" end="01:44:03.130" style="s2">but it will make you smarter</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.800" end="01:44:04.330" style="s2">the other way to become smarter is to</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.130" end="01:44:06.760" style="s2">not be so attached to being right</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.330" end="01:44:09.010" style="s2">because if you&#39;re attached to being</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.760" end="01:44:11.800" style="s2">right then you&#39;re not going to think you</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.010" end="01:44:14.500" style="s2">fault and the old thoughts aware deeper</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.800" end="01:44:16.900" style="s2">and deeper rot in your brain I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.500" end="01:44:19.870" style="s2">there&#39;s probably a neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.900" end="01:44:21.610" style="s2">equivalent to what I&#39;m saying there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.870" end="01:44:24.220" style="s2">there&#39;s actually just a very simple TED</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.610" end="01:44:25.900" style="s2">talk that a lady gave put it in the show</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.220" end="01:44:28.960" style="s2">notes later it was called something like</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.900" end="01:44:31.120" style="s2">on being wrong she went into the Steve</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.960" end="01:44:33.250" style="s2">study on the human psychology related to</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.120" end="01:44:35.560" style="s2">being wrong to give a short TED talk is</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.250" end="01:44:36.700" style="s2">really adorable but she started by</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.560" end="01:44:39.220" style="s2">saying what does it feel like to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.700" end="01:44:40.270" style="s2">wrong and everyone said like shameful</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.220" end="01:44:42.430" style="s2">embarrassment ever and she&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.270" end="01:44:44.020" style="s2">that&#39;s what it feels like to realize you</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.430" end="01:44:48.010" style="s2">were wrong what it feels like to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.020" end="01:44:49.420" style="s2">wrong before you realize it is what it</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.010" end="01:44:54.730" style="s2">feels like to be right</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.420" end="01:44:55.930" style="s2">and but even more right well this is the</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.730" end="01:44:59.410" style="s2">thing is so interesting when we look</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.930" end="01:45:01.600" style="s2">back at previous cultures we say oh like</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.410" end="01:45:05.860" style="s2">most of the things previous people</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.600" end="01:45:07.660" style="s2">believed we nothing to be wrong and many</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.860" end="01:45:10.390" style="s2">of the things I believe 10 years ago I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.660" end="01:45:11.500" style="s2">sure wrong now and most of the things</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.390" end="01:45:13.450" style="s2">other people believe I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.500" end="01:45:15.090" style="s2">wrong but I can&#39;t say a single thing</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.450" end="01:45:17.830" style="s2">that I think I&#39;m wrong about right now</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.090" end="01:45:19.000" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s terrible because</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.830" end="01:45:20.830" style="s2">statistically I&#39;m probably wrong about</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.000" end="01:45:25.660" style="s2">almost everything right now even to my</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.830" end="01:45:28.990" style="s2">own future self yeah and I would I would</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.660" end="01:45:32.410" style="s2">so like that knowledge and that humility</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.990" end="01:45:34.420" style="s2">and the willingness to say maybe what</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.410" end="01:45:41.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve believed is wrong I would sure like</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.420" end="01:45:44.830" style="s2">that to to be embodied on the collective</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.080" end="01:45:49.000" style="s2">level because so much of what our</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.830" end="01:45:49.830" style="s2">civilization is convinced is right about</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.000" end="01:45:55.150" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.830" end="01:45:58.270" style="s2">I think it&#39;s wrong and it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.150" end="01:46:03.310" style="s2">produced very good results you know I</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.270" end="01:46:05.770" style="s2">think maybe what what brings people to</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.310" end="01:46:08.460" style="s2">humility I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.770" end="01:46:13.150" style="s2">anything other than humiliation that</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.460" end="01:46:17.020" style="s2">that brings maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.150" end="01:46:21.130" style="s2">humiliation and I think that perhaps our</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.020" end="01:46:26.290" style="s2">society is going through the humiliation</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.130" end="01:46:30.490" style="s2">of collapse of our aspirations and our</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.290" end="01:46:36.130" style="s2">pretenses to to create a better world</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.490" end="01:46:38.080" style="s2">through the technologies of control no</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.130" end="01:46:46.440" style="s2">there is something else that creates</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.080" end="01:46:46.440" style="s2">humility thinking well creates humility</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.120" end="01:46:52.750" style="s2">this is actually it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.380" end="01:46:54.940" style="s2">because if I think well I can start to</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.750" end="01:46:57.640" style="s2">enumerate all the things that I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.940" end="01:46:59.620" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know rightly the known</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.640" end="01:47:01.240" style="s2">unknown set is very large and I can be</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.620" end="01:47:02.229" style="s2">aware that the unknown unknown said is</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.240" end="01:47:04.479" style="s2">even larger</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.229" end="01:47:06.880" style="s2">and when I start to study nature and the</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.479" end="01:47:08.709" style="s2">complexity of it and so this is where</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.880" end="01:47:10.030" style="s2">like Carl Sagan would talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.709" end="01:47:11.550" style="s2">humility that comes from studying</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.030" end="01:47:14.349" style="s2">astronomy and the size of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.550" end="01:47:17.440" style="s2">yeah you would see this kind of radical</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.349" end="01:47:19.449" style="s2">humility that Einstein had and like most</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.440" end="01:47:24.400" style="s2">of people who studied nature and thought</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.449" end="01:47:27.130" style="s2">thought well they recognized that the</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.400" end="01:47:30.369" style="s2">sphere of what they knew as it was</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.130" end="01:47:31.809" style="s2">increasing that the unknown unknown that</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.369" end="01:47:33.249" style="s2">they didn&#39;t even know that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.809" end="01:47:35.709" style="s2">know stuff about is moving into the</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.249" end="01:47:37.510" style="s2">known unknown there there&#39;s more stuff</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.709" end="01:47:39.929" style="s2">that they know they wish they knew that</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.510" end="01:47:42.550" style="s2">they don&#39;t know than they did previously</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.929" end="01:47:45.999" style="s2">yeah and and so there&#39;s a humility</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.550" end="01:47:47.590" style="s2">that&#39;s possible just by recognizing how</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.999" end="01:47:49.539" style="s2">easy it is to believe you&#39;re right well</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.590" end="01:47:50.320" style="s2">being wrong looking at how much you</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.539" end="01:47:52.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.320" end="01:47:55.829" style="s2">studying the complexity of nature</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.110" end="01:47:58.239" style="s2">experiencing all at the complexity of it</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.829" end="01:48:00.190" style="s2">imagining if you had to manage the</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.239" end="01:48:05.170" style="s2">metabolic processes of a single cell in</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.190" end="01:48:08.170" style="s2">your body consciously yeah totally they</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.170" end="01:48:09.699" style="s2">used to be like these metabolic Maps you</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.170" end="01:48:14.409" style="s2">know like these little flow charts of</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.699" end="01:48:17.650" style="s2">cellular metabolism and now it would</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.409" end="01:48:20.860" style="s2">take like you know a fine print poster</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.650" end="01:48:23.199" style="s2">covering like three walls to include all</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.860" end="01:48:25.659" style="s2">of that that&#39;s central ions</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.199" end="01:48:27.969" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s my office those metabolic</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.659" end="01:48:29.969" style="s2">charts oh really yeah because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.969" end="01:48:31.929" style="s2">and they&#39;re so read they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.969" end="01:48:34.019" style="s2">oversimplified for what it really is and</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.929" end="01:48:36.849" style="s2">still so complex and so beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.019" end="01:48:38.499" style="s2">well I was talking not just you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.849" end="01:48:41.070" style="s2">because some people might interpret what</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.499" end="01:48:45.360" style="s2">you&#39;re saying as simply well there are</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.070" end="01:48:47.949" style="s2">facts that our way of knowing has not</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.360" end="01:48:52.030" style="s2">discovered yet so there&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.949" end="01:48:57.190" style="s2">know but we know how to know and when</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.030" end="01:49:01.329" style="s2">I&#39;m suggesting also says that our ways</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.190" end="01:49:03.489" style="s2">of knowing have built-in limitations and</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.329" end="01:49:04.809" style="s2">are insufficient to discovering the</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.489" end="01:49:08.170" style="s2">things we really need to know right now</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.809" end="01:49:12.099" style="s2">and our ways of knowing come from our</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.170" end="01:49:14.739" style="s2">metaphysics again I would say that if we</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.099" end="01:49:16.130" style="s2">if we are really endeavoring to think</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.739" end="01:49:18.620" style="s2">well what you real</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.130" end="01:49:22.550" style="s2">lies to their which is that their upper</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.620" end="01:49:24.650" style="s2">limits on our epistemic capacity people</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.550" end="01:49:27.050" style="s2">recognize right like girdles and</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.650" end="01:49:28.389" style="s2">completeness theorem is something that</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.050" end="01:49:30.949" style="s2">if you&#39;re a mathematician</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.389" end="01:49:32.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying eventually we&#39;ll know</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.949" end="01:49:35.239" style="s2">all math no actually we&#39;ll never know</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.840" end="01:49:38.179" style="s2">all math that&#39;s an upper boundary on the</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.239" end="01:49:40.370" style="s2">know ability of math itself if you study</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.179" end="01:49:42.040" style="s2">Heisenberg&#39;s and determinism I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.370" end="01:49:44.030" style="s2">actually know position and momentum</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.040" end="01:49:45.949" style="s2">simultaneously for fundamental reasons</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.030" end="01:49:49.310" style="s2">or Bell&#39;s Theorem on locality and</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.949" end="01:49:50.840" style="s2">mechanism like the highest principles</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.310" end="01:49:53.449" style="s2">and almost all these disciplines are</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.840" end="01:49:55.010" style="s2">actually limits on the knowable we just</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.449" end="01:49:57.380" style="s2">don&#39;t like to pay attention to that as</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.010" end="01:49:59.239" style="s2">much because the stuff that we know we</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.380" end="01:50:02.420" style="s2">can control reality with and get</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.239" end="01:50:05.060" style="s2">adaptive advantage from mmm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.420" end="01:50:08.290" style="s2">well it would be fun to talk to you more</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.060" end="01:50:12.650" style="s2">about Goodell&#39;s theorem I that was my</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.290" end="01:50:16.219" style="s2">area of study in college and I went</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.650" end="01:50:18.199" style="s2">pretty deep into it but I feel like now</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.219" end="01:50:20.389" style="s2">it&#39;s not the time for that like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.199" end="01:50:23.420" style="s2">long like there&#39;s something you said</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.389" end="01:50:25.429" style="s2">like well yeah but there&#39;s like there be</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.420" end="01:50:30.260" style="s2">interesting that would be fun to do</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.429" end="01:50:34.420" style="s2">sometime I agree that would be fun okay</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.260" end="01:50:36.920" style="s2">so I would also like to go into why</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.420" end="01:50:38.960" style="s2">virial and post-modernism is not the</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.920" end="01:50:41.060" style="s2">answer to excess of certainty and what a</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.960" end="01:50:43.280" style="s2">mature relationship to certainty and</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.060" end="01:50:44.690" style="s2">uncertainty is that neither villainize</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.280" end="01:50:49.370" style="s2">is uncertainty nor villainize a</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.690" end="01:50:51.679" style="s2">certainty but that&#39;s also a long a kind</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.370" end="01:50:53.239" style="s2">of long deep topic so we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.679" end="01:50:56.600" style="s2">plenty of things we can flag for a</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.239" end="01:51:00.980" style="s2">future conversation yeah as we wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.600" end="01:51:03.770" style="s2">here for time reasons what are some</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.980" end="01:51:06.440" style="s2">things just the people can do to</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.770" end="01:51:09.560" style="s2">increase the quality of their sense</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.440" end="01:51:10.850" style="s2">making in the current world we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.560" end="01:51:12.170" style="s2">already said some of them but I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.850" end="01:51:14.719" style="s2">want to like leave people with some</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.170" end="01:51:17.949" style="s2">clarity yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.719" end="01:51:17.949" style="s2">what are some of the main ones you pick</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.850" end="01:51:21.850" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.140" end="01:51:35.020" style="s2">I hope that just listening to our</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.780" end="01:51:42.880" style="s2">conversation might have caused some</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.020" end="01:51:44.980" style="s2">gears to start turning I think that you</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.880" end="01:51:48.610" style="s2">know what you and I are saying doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.980" end="01:51:54.730" style="s2">fit into existing polarized narratives</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.610" end="01:51:57.750" style="s2">and is also hard to dismiss as being the</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.730" end="01:52:00.430" style="s2">result of having shit-for-brains</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.750" end="01:52:04.080" style="s2">you know like there&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.430" end="01:52:09.700" style="s2">that that I mean I guess you could just</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.080" end="01:52:12.160" style="s2">make a story about how we&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.700" end="01:52:19.740" style="s2">idiots and delusional and stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.160" end="01:52:19.740" style="s2">think just that data point it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.890" end="01:52:24.040" style="s2">pinprick in the veil and there&#39;s light</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.180" end="01:52:27.250" style="s2">coming in from the outside no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.040" end="01:52:29.950" style="s2">want to like you know inflate our our</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.250" end="01:52:37.210" style="s2">intelligence or our conversation but but</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.950" end="01:52:41.260" style="s2">I think as people here hear information</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.210" end="01:52:44.440" style="s2">and and alternative sense making that</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.260" end="01:52:49.110" style="s2">comes from a place unfamiliar to them</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.440" end="01:52:49.110" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense of of</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.230" end="01:52:56.200" style="s2">invitation of freshness because I think</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.170" end="01:53:03.060" style="s2">that more and more people are really</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.200" end="01:53:03.060" style="s2">impatient and frustrated with the</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.120" end="01:53:09.610" style="s2">structures the conceptual structures</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.380" end="01:53:12.970" style="s2">that that have been offered them that</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.610" end="01:53:15.250" style="s2">that have been indoctrinated or that</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.970" end="01:53:19.210" style="s2">they&#39;ve been indoctrinated with and I</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.250" end="01:53:21.610" style="s2">think to trust that frustration would be</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.210" end="01:53:24.280" style="s2">a good step and to validate that and</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.610" end="01:53:26.430" style="s2">just end and that feeling like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.280" end="01:53:29.410" style="s2">something I have not been told here</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.430" end="01:53:33.070" style="s2">there are new thoughts that are wanting</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.410" end="01:53:37.140" style="s2">to come and to give attention to your</p>

<p begin="01:53:37.140" end="01:53:44.730" style="s2">to the willingness to have been wrong to</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.660" end="01:53:47.630" style="s2">have that realization the willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.730" end="01:53:52.920" style="s2">let go of your identification with</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.630" end="01:53:55.650" style="s2">dearly held viewpoints to notice how</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.920" end="01:54:00.600" style="s2">those have become part of an identity to</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.650" end="01:54:03.870" style="s2">feel the wound of separation the trauma</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.600" end="01:54:07.680" style="s2">of of alienation of having been cut off</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.870" end="01:54:12.140" style="s2">from community in nature and to be like</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.680" end="01:54:15.810" style="s2">yeah that really hurts no wonder I</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.140" end="01:54:20.960" style="s2">gravitate toward simplified opinions</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.810" end="01:54:22.920" style="s2">that give me a sense of inclusion I</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.960" end="01:54:26.220" style="s2">don&#39;t think that there&#39;s an easy</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.920" end="01:54:29.610" style="s2">shortcut to resew to to rebuilding the</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.220" end="01:54:33.960" style="s2">lost connections you know I mean we are</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.610" end="01:54:37.350" style="s2">we are in a hard situation I mean but at</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.960" end="01:54:39.780" style="s2">least it&#39;s not your fault you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.350" end="01:54:44.750" style="s2">not because you&#39;re bad we&#39;ve been cast</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.780" end="01:54:49.020" style="s2">into a really dysfunctional sick sick</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.750" end="01:54:54.050" style="s2">civilization and hopefully and I believe</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.020" end="01:55:05.760" style="s2">this we&#39;re approaching its nadir and the</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.050" end="01:55:10.590" style="s2">age of reunion is underway yeah and it</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.760" end="01:55:19.710" style="s2">also you mentioned Carl Sagan and the</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.590" end="01:55:21.720" style="s2">feeling of awe and wonder and this this</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.710" end="01:55:24.060" style="s2">new territory that becomes available</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.720" end="01:55:26.550" style="s2">when we let go of of what we thought we</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.060" end="01:55:28.650" style="s2">knew what we thought was true what we</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.550" end="01:55:31.440" style="s2">thought was real but we thought was</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.650" end="01:55:35.460" style="s2">possible it&#39;s really exciting and fun to</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.440" end="01:55:40.640" style="s2">be there and and I think - uh yeah to</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.460" end="01:55:40.640" style="s2">engage that childish playful spirit</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.800" end="01:55:47.990" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t offer much of a</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.240" end="01:55:51.410" style="s2">formula beyond beyond those things so I</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.990" end="01:55:53.670" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go ahead an appeal to the</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.410" end="01:55:56.190" style="s2">shortened attention span decreased</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.670" end="01:55:58.710" style="s2">sovereignty need of people with</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.190" end="01:56:01.440" style="s2">something like a bullet point list of</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.710" end="01:56:04.670" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve heard you say in this</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.440" end="01:56:10.980" style="s2">conversation so far so for summary I</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.670" end="01:56:13.610" style="s2">heard you say that you intake thinking</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.980" end="01:56:16.200" style="s2">and news sources from what seemed like a</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.610" end="01:56:17.820" style="s2">diversity of perspectives things that</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.200" end="01:56:22.350" style="s2">look like political left and political</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.820" end="01:56:24.270" style="s2">right and etc and things that not just</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.350" end="01:56:26.340" style="s2">saying okay I&#39;m taking in the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.270" end="01:56:29.070" style="s2">or fair on all sides but I&#39;m taking in</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.340" end="01:56:32.490" style="s2">it what seems like actually has some</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.070" end="01:56:35.190" style="s2">good thinking and so one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.490" end="01:56:38.160" style="s2">people could do would be to readjust</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.190" end="01:56:39.450" style="s2">their Facebook newsfeed or to get the</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.160" end="01:56:43.080" style="s2"> off their Facebook newsfeed is</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.450" end="01:56:44.610" style="s2">their primary source of news and say for</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.080" end="01:56:47.400" style="s2">any issue they want to become educated</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.610" end="01:56:49.500" style="s2">about if everyone doesn&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.400" end="01:56:51.570" style="s2">can we actually study the various</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.500" end="01:56:53.700" style="s2">perspectives and look for partial truth</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.570" end="01:56:55.950" style="s2">first and then see can I actually do</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.700" end="01:56:59.070" style="s2">synthesis on that and that of course</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.950" end="01:57:00.960" style="s2">requires giving a little bit of respect</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.070" end="01:57:02.520" style="s2">to someone that you might have thought</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.960" end="01:57:03.960" style="s2">of as the enemy before enough to</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.520" end="01:57:07.110" style="s2">actually listen and see if there was</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.960" end="01:57:10.920" style="s2">anything to learn and you know when we</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.110" end="01:57:12.240" style="s2">had Jordan Greenhalgh on he he&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.920" end="01:57:14.970" style="s2">this movie further than most people I</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.240" end="01:57:17.430" style="s2">know where he has a curated like 165</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.970" end="01:57:20.010" style="s2">different news feeds that he that he</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.430" end="01:57:22.140" style="s2">checks every day that were from the</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.010" end="01:57:24.420" style="s2">Russian the Chinese the Israeli the</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.140" end="01:57:25.920" style="s2">left-right the hacker the etc</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.420" end="01:57:29.430" style="s2">perspectives and tries to run air</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.920" end="01:57:30.660" style="s2">correction parallax on that so but again</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.430" end="01:57:35.670" style="s2">I think this is something that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.660" end="01:57:38.640" style="s2">who thinks well ends up saying is taken</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.670" end="01:57:42.480" style="s2">a variety of perspectives in your study</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.640" end="01:57:44.100" style="s2">on things yeah and then I&#39;ll sort it can</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.480" end="01:57:45.670" style="s2">I add to that yeah of course off your</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.100" end="01:57:47.800" style="s2">bullet point I mean</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.670" end="01:57:50.440" style="s2">and also what what I do is I try to</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.800" end="01:57:54.880" style="s2">really go into it and do my best to</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.440" end="01:57:57.160" style="s2">believe it okay what has to be true for</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.880" end="01:58:01.120" style="s2">this to be true or where does this</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.160" end="01:58:03.010" style="s2">person have to be seated and how how do</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.120" end="01:58:05.590" style="s2">they how where does it like to be them</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.010" end="01:58:07.120" style="s2">for them to believe these things what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.590" end="01:58:08.890" style="s2">their experiences life because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.120" end="01:58:13.000" style="s2">truth in everything because it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.890" end="01:58:14.380" style="s2">from a person&#39;s seat in the world okay</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.000" end="01:58:16.690" style="s2">you just said something very deep which</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.380" end="01:58:18.760" style="s2">is like a two-fold one is you&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.690" end="01:58:20.470" style="s2">a Hegelian dialectic or something like</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.760" end="01:58:22.420" style="s2">that that says okay let&#39;s make the</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.470" end="01:58:24.010" style="s2">thesis first then we can make the</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.420" end="01:58:26.620" style="s2">antithesis then we can look for the</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.010" end="01:58:28.510" style="s2">synthesis though rather than read it</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.620" end="01:58:31.120" style="s2">looking to debunk it can I read it</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.510" end="01:58:32.740" style="s2">looking to say what is the truth in this</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.120" end="01:58:34.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s from a rational point of view</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.740" end="01:58:37.840" style="s2">but then also from an empathetic point</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.810" end="01:58:39.870" style="s2">of view what are the values and the</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.840" end="01:58:42.850" style="s2">needs being met of people who are</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.870" end="01:58:47.590" style="s2">believing this and can I actually feel</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.850" end="01:58:50.860" style="s2">that right because actually the opinions</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.590" end="01:58:55.780" style="s2">are just like the outer clothing on a</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.860" end="01:58:59.200" style="s2">state of being that that that magnetizes</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.780" end="01:59:00.700" style="s2">those opinions to it and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.200" end="01:59:04.990" style="s2">people do not change their opinions</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.700" end="01:59:06.730" style="s2">there&#39;s not a deeper change right the</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.990" end="01:59:11.160" style="s2">opinion that our presidents with with a</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.730" end="01:59:15.760" style="s2">state of being so there is a obviously</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.160" end="01:59:19.300" style="s2">the invitation you&#39;re giving here is for</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.760" end="01:59:21.790" style="s2">people to dis identify with their</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.300" end="01:59:23.590" style="s2">opinions writ large which allows their</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.790" end="01:59:25.870" style="s2">opinions to continue to grow and become</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.590" end="01:59:29.530" style="s2">more accurate and more complex and more</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.870" end="01:59:32.860" style="s2">nuanced and that requires some change of</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.530" end="01:59:35.170" style="s2">being that says I am NOT the being that</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.860" end="01:59:37.210" style="s2">works with this particular in-group or</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.170" end="01:59:39.220" style="s2">that is getting a need met from a sense</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.210" end="01:59:41.590" style="s2">of indignation or that is responding to</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.220" end="01:59:43.840" style="s2">trauma and doing in group norming on</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.590" end="01:59:46.090" style="s2">that and that&#39;s deep right like so</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.840" end="01:59:48.840" style="s2">partly what I heard you say beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.090" end="01:59:52.690" style="s2">news thing was be introspective about</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.840" end="01:59:55.300" style="s2">your own cognitive biases and the way</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.690" end="01:59:56.770" style="s2">that your own reactivity patterns happen</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.300" end="01:59:59.020" style="s2">notice when you go straight into</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.770" end="02:00:01.450" style="s2">indignation and being pissed off and</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.020" end="02:00:06.070" style="s2">justice and be suspicious of those</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.450" end="02:00:08.890" style="s2">things yeah but then practically in</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.070" end="02:00:11.410" style="s2">addition to read new sources for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.890" end="02:00:12.730" style="s2">also have conversations with people who</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.410" end="02:00:14.680" style="s2">hold different views where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.730" end="02:00:21.610" style="s2">earnestly seeking to understand their</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.680" end="02:00:24.460" style="s2">come from mm-hmm yeah and actually</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.610" end="02:00:27.400" style="s2">engage attention where you read things</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.460" end="02:00:30.010" style="s2">more than bullet points and can hold</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.400" end="02:00:35.410" style="s2">multiple perspectives or multiple data</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.010" end="02:00:37.260" style="s2">points simultaneously yeah yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.410" end="02:00:42.160" style="s2">could say a lot more about that but</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.260" end="02:00:44.680" style="s2">maybe about judgment and the filters</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.160" end="02:00:50.980" style="s2">that we put between ourselves and other</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.680" end="02:00:55.000" style="s2">people the filters of judgment and how</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.980" end="02:00:58.000" style="s2">those judgments prop up a self-image I</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.000" end="02:01:04.740" style="s2">mean it gets into what you might call</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.000" end="02:01:07.390" style="s2">spirituality or work on self mm-hm and</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.740" end="02:01:10.000" style="s2">comes down to the trauma that our</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.390" end="02:01:15.490" style="s2">civilization and our personal</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.000" end="02:01:17.770" style="s2">circumstances have handed us all these</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.490" end="02:01:22.270" style="s2">levels you know from the most personal</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.770" end="02:01:26.890" style="s2">to the to the civilizational are just so</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.270" end="02:01:29.320" style="s2">interlinked and I guess I mean partly</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.890" end="02:01:32.530" style="s2">part of the the mindset of find the</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.320" end="02:01:34.150" style="s2">cause wants us to say okay so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.530" end="02:01:36.280" style="s2">gonna work on the personal or here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.150" end="02:01:38.320" style="s2">cause it&#39;s trauma or here&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.280" end="02:01:41.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a germ it&#39;s information no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.320" end="02:01:45.400" style="s2">trauma not that trauma is not an</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.620" end="02:01:50.170" style="s2">important piece of the puzzle but I</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.400" end="02:01:54.120" style="s2">believe that we&#39;re having a kind of a</p>

<p begin="02:03:12.369" end="02:03:25.889" style="s2">here&#39;s the key thing that changes</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.710" end="02:03:25.889" style="s2">everything else yeah I think when we say</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.630" end="02:03:34.000" style="s2">increasing the quality of our sense</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.219" end="02:03:36.219" style="s2">making it&#39;s not the one key but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.000" end="02:03:39.670" style="s2">also of a different type of thing than</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.219" end="02:03:43.000" style="s2">saying carbon or GDP because it isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.670" end="02:03:44.530" style="s2">metric right it is how do we relate to</p>

<p begin="02:03:53.199" end="02:04:01.270" style="s2">how to act yeah it is different but on a</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.539" end="02:04:06.280" style="s2">more meta level it&#39;s still kind of like</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.270" end="02:04:07.179" style="s2">okay what&#39;s the one thing you know yeah</p>

<p begin="02:04:11.650" end="02:04:19.019" style="s2">understanding how this change is gonna</p>
