<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">below hips during the sit and why</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">i have a knee injury and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">little strenuous</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">uh the point about getting the knees</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">below the hips really equal to the hips</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">is it takes the s curve out of your</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:31.919" style="s2">um then what will happen is my spinal</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:34.960" style="s2">curve</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">and my chest will collapse and um this</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.960" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:39.039" style="s2">this is a way of inhabiting your body</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.280" style="s2">that is associated with anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.039" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">uh poor breathing habits uh so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.280" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">have less oxygen be more anxious</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">um so it&#39;s a challenge now on the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">um if you have a knee injury remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">our principle here we never</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">endure we&#39;re always trying to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">we&#39;re always trying to educate to draw</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">we&#39;re not ever just enduring so if your</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">knee is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">then i recommend you sit on a chair if</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">you sit on a chair</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">um then what you can do is you can sit</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">what&#39;s called egyptian posture</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">you&#39;re putting your feet in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">you put your hands on your knees then</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">you go through the centering and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:12.640" style="s2">rooting</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">if you don&#39;t need to use the back of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.640" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">chair try not to if you&#39;re also having</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">back issues</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">uh because sometimes knee and back tend</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">to be related</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">because we uh they&#39;re we at least tend</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">to favor one leg or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.080" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">so if that is the case i don&#39;t know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">just saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">uh then after we&#39;ve centered and rooted</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">you can lean back slightly and take the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">pressure off</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">on the chair so uh we&#39;ll try sitting in</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">times while practicing mindfulness do</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">you why</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">yes this is very common um there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">couple things probably going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">if we get to a place where we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">co-activating</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">the task focus network and the default</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">mode network and i&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:04.960" style="s2">or triggering both the sympathetic and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">the parasympathetic system</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.960" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">we can get significant</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:11.760" style="s2">uh stimulation of the vagus nerve system</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.760" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">and so there&#39;s ways in which parts of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">the brain are all starting to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">and then we get that kind of response</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s stronger in people</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">i remember when that first started</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">happening to me it was like an electric</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">shock was going through my body part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">why this particular course</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">in this particular set of practices the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">psychology practices i&#39;m teaching you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">um is more prone to that is because this</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">since i&#39;m what i&#39;m teaching you is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:39.520" style="s2">very embodied form</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">of mindfulness one of the criticisms i</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.520" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">have of just</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:44.400" style="s2">sitting is it tends to get just into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.400" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">and it tends to not involve the body</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">um whereas the teaching i had in tai chi</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">chuan</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">and of course chi kung those are very</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:55.919" style="s2">embodied forms of mindfulness and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:22:58.400" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.919" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">so you get a you get this sense of and i</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.400" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">use this</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">as a metaphor of energy uh moving</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">through your body</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">uh in this more embodied form of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.799" end="00:23:08.960" style="s2">mindfulness ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">i would argue it is much much better for</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.960" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">you because i think the disembodied</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:14.640" style="s2">forms of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">are do not reach into the depths of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.640" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">existence and our embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">and they&#39;re not as adaptive and as</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">responsive and resilient</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">i know some people won&#39;t like to hear</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">that uh and i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">that a purely acidic practice is is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">good but there&#39;s clear cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">that if you&#39;re doing a moving practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:33.840" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re kicking in the cerebellum</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">the cerebellum has more neurons in it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.840" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">than all of your cortex</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:39.679" style="s2">they&#39;re not organized to produce</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.679" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">or consciousness but what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">they first of all give you tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">physical balance and integrity</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">embodied but that also translates into</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">balance and integrity and a balance and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">integrity of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">so engaging the cerebellum is a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">helpful thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">the kennedy high neck i can never get</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">through all</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">full motorcycle in 15 minutes change the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">pace or take a long evening set take a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">longer set</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">take a longer circuit if if that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">and take a longer set there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:17.760" style="s2">about how you are working with</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:19.039" style="s2">right the grain of your mind as some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.760" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">the traditions talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.039" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">uh that needs to be respected right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">so i would say uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">try and do a longer set</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">mark the fever hello mark and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">thank mark marquez uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">in the sena and he&#39;s there and his</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">wonderful good humor</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">and i think his presence um is so</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">and i believe it&#39;s encouraging to other</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">people so i wanted to thank mark for</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">that right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">uh this is the 200th question i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">answering already</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">wow time goes hey tempest fugit</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.960" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">i have a practice i call zen sweeping</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">which is probably embodied flow</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">the flow you seem to talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:24:59.120" style="s2">meditation seems like internally</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">embodied flow</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">yes mark that&#39;s right that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">correct in a way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">of conceptualizing it conceiving of</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">this works well for me in the rooting</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">step but i&#39;m having issues with the flow</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">can you offer any sites to help me do</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">the flow stage better</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">so uh you</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:26.559" style="s2">might want to try to see</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">the continuity between rooting and flow</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">so remember there&#39;s a stage in where</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">we&#39;re letting it flow</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">and if that&#39;s working for you in rooting</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">pay attention to what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">feels like remember the taste that tempo</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">the texture like the tenure</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">the timing right of your mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">what does that taste like in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">when you&#39;re letting it flow within</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">rooting try to create a felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">that and then try to bring that felt</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">into the areas you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">cultivate your sense of flow</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">so i think that might help so</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">try to exact and make use of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">the affordance of flow that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">present within routing if the routing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">working well for you</p>
