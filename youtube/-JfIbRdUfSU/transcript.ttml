<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.620" style="s2">Graduation is highly significant for young people because it is a death and a renewal at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.620" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">I mean, it&#39;s a good way of learning, too,<br />about life because, you see, when you graduate,</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.500" end="00:00:15.000" style="s2">simultaneously, you have<br />attained the pinnacle of something.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.000" end="00:00:20.700" style="s2">But by the same token it instantly transforms<br />you into a beginner at the next stage of your life.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.740" end="00:00:25.840" style="s2">When people say, &quot;What do you want<br />to be when they grow up in our society&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.860" end="00:00:27.940" style="s2">they usually mean: &quot;What career are you going to pick?&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.940" end="00:00:32.220" style="s2">It&#39;s really not the way the question<br />should be asked or conceptualized.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.240" end="00:00:35.580" style="s2">You should really think about<br />what sort of character you want to have.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.260" end="00:00:37.880" style="s2">I would say you should surround yourself</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.880" end="00:00:41.480" style="s2">with people who are aiming up and<br />who want the best for what&#39;s best in you.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">Unless you want people that<br />will excuse your pathologies</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">and make way for your weakness<br />and lead you down the path of perdition.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.260" end="00:00:52.720" style="s2">So you&#39;re going to take care of yourself,</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:54.680" style="s2">you&#39;re going to take care of your family,</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.680" end="00:00:56.240" style="s2">you&#39;re going to take care of your community.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.240" end="00:01:00.800" style="s2">You want to grow up and be<br />a responsible, forthright and honest person.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.180" end="00:01:02.680" style="s2">It&#39;s the best way through life.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:05.880" style="s2">There could be a lot more to you than you know,</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.300" end="00:01:09.180" style="s2">highly probable, and you should act as if there is</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.180" end="00:01:12.760" style="s2">and then you should go out there<br />and try to do, if not great things,</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.760" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">at least honest, productive,<br />meaningful, engaged and positive things.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:20.420" style="s2">That&#39;s what you should be aiming at.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.420" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing in that except good.</p>
