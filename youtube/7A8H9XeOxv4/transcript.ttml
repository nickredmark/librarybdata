<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:28.320" style="s2">like a syllabic thing it&#39;s a very like</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:32.579" style="s2">it&#39;s very close to other syllables I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:35.309" style="s2">think that&#39;s all it is say it out loud</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.579" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">Daniel Greg no Greg am I saying it right</p>

<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:50.660" style="s2">guest today is Dana Gregg and he and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">are collaborators on a Brooke book</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.660" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">called a cognitive continuum from</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">insight to enlightenment we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:00:59.579" style="s2">on that together you might some of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:03.090" style="s2">might have seen the IndieGoGo campaign</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:04.920" style="s2">to raise money to help support Daniel as</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">he endeavors to work on this project I</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.920" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">want to reiterate once again that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.049" style="s2">campaign is not going to bring me any</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">income</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.049" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">I am a tenured professor with a nice</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">stable salary Daniel is not the intent</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">is to try and raise money for him so</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">that he can put the kind of work into</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">this that we both think it deserves and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">I know that Daniel passionately wants to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">give it because he&#39;s deeply invested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:34.740" style="s2">this project and cares about it very</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.150" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">very deeply so the BA the broad purview</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.740" end="00:01:37.470" style="s2">for voices with Verve a key is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">discussions about sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.470" end="00:01:40.500" style="s2">relationship between science and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">spirituality in the context the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.500" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">historical cultural historical context</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">of meaning crisis and that&#39;s why Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">is collaborating with me on cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:54.049" style="s2">continuum but what I thought we&#39;d zero</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:56.369" style="s2">in on today is something that Daniel has</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.049" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">some particular expertise on he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.369" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">quite a bit of work on he&#39;s had a huge</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">influence on myself and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">perfectly pitched at the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">between science and spirituality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.349" style="s2">meaning crisis which of course is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:12.420" style="s2">has been called the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.349" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">Renaissance before I turn things over to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.420" end="00:02:15.990" style="s2">Daniel I just want to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:19.260" style="s2">on both of our behalves that we are both</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.990" end="00:02:24.900" style="s2">also deeply indebted to anderson todd</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.260" end="00:02:27.240" style="s2">who has also done a lot of work and with</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.900" end="00:02:30.150" style="s2">both of us and is also doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.240" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">work on sort of the kiya cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:37.640" style="s2">science of psychedelics but today I want</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:41.340" style="s2">to focus on what Daniel has to say and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.640" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">what he thinks about the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.340" end="00:02:44.300" style="s2">Renaissance what it says about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">intersection between science</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.300" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">spirituality and the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:52.230" style="s2">I do have a lot of things to say about</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.140" end="00:02:53.940" style="s2">it yes very happy to be talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.230" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of issues that have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">coming up as I&#39;ve been sort of engaged</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">in the Toronto psychedelic community and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:03.450" style="s2">more broadly than that so one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:05.510" style="s2">I think is an interesting problem so a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.450" end="00:03:07.590" style="s2">lot of people have been focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.510" end="00:03:09.060" style="s2">psychedelic Renaissance but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.590" end="00:03:11.880" style="s2">that&#39;s actually just one subset of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:13.800" style="s2">larger issue which I like to call now</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.880" end="00:03:15.510" style="s2">the consciousness revolution right some</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.800" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">people sharing memes being like we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.510" end="00:03:18.660" style="s2">a consciousness revolution but I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually already ongoing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.660" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s been quickening ever since the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:26.310" style="s2">early 1900s so maybe we could reframe it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:30.930" style="s2">then that what we should be talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.310" end="00:03:33.630" style="s2">about is a renaissance around the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.930" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">importance the potential at least the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.630" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">potential importance of altered states</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.890" end="00:03:38.459" style="s2">of consciousness and therefore we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:43.019" style="s2">see things as well as like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.459" end="00:03:46.410" style="s2">mindfulness revolution and the you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.019" end="00:03:50.190" style="s2">other related phenomena even escaping</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.410" end="00:03:51.450" style="s2">into virtual worlds as ways of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.190" end="00:03:54.450" style="s2">play with altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.450" end="00:03:55.800" style="s2">consciousness as a way of responding to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.450" end="00:03:57.660" style="s2">the meeting crisis is that a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.800" end="00:03:58.730" style="s2">reformulation do you think yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.660" end="00:04:03.030" style="s2">think that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.730" end="00:04:04.350" style="s2">any VR meditation psychedelics there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.030" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">even like a whole bunch of weird</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.350" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">practices emerging on the periphery I</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:09.450" style="s2">think even circling counts it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:10.950" style="s2">a collective altered state induction oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.450" end="00:04:14.220" style="s2">I would definitely say that circling</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.950" end="00:04:18.080" style="s2">counts I think and you and I have talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.220" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">about this you know the proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.080" end="00:04:22.500" style="s2">psycho technologies and supportive</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:24.750" style="s2">technologies for getting people into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.500" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">flow state I think also part of this as</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.750" end="00:04:27.750" style="s2">well yeah and there&#39;s also people trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">to in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.750" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">to create virtual reality with like</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:33.570" style="s2">transcranial direct stimulation that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:35.070" style="s2">will like do some flow hacking as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.570" end="00:04:37.710" style="s2">involved in a fully immersive video game</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.070" end="00:04:39.060" style="s2">so these potentials are really</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.710" end="00:04:41.550" style="s2">interesting but also a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.060" end="00:04:43.350" style="s2">worrying yeah because you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:45.150" style="s2">inherent to these things that we will</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.350" end="00:04:46.920" style="s2">use them for good and in fact I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.150" end="00:04:49.290" style="s2">there are a bunch of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.920" end="00:04:51.570" style="s2">cautions which are some things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.290" end="00:04:54.180" style="s2">been playing with perhaps including in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.570" end="00:04:57.540" style="s2">the book so for altered states in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.180" end="00:04:59.760" style="s2">general and for wisdom because in more</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.540" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">ancient trends and philosophy altered</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.760" end="00:05:04.050" style="s2">states and wisdom go hand in hand very</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">tightly integrated together deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.050" end="00:05:08.130" style="s2">so in fact yeah yeah I know Plato&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:11.300" style="s2">this one great dialogue the phaedra</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.130" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">swear he says well through Socrates that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.300" end="00:05:15.150" style="s2">you know altered states prophecy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:16.680" style="s2">like a divine kind of badness which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.150" end="00:05:18.150" style="s2">better than any kind of like sober</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.680" end="00:05:19.290" style="s2">waking state because we get great things</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.150" end="00:05:21.660" style="s2">when we go into those states of divine</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.290" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">madness but there&#39;s the issue of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.660" end="00:05:26.220" style="s2">for one false prophets people who dress</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:28.530" style="s2">things up as though they are seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">the answer to all issues but then</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.530" end="00:05:32.610" style="s2">actually those were things that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:34.979" style="s2">going to accelerate or decline in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.610" end="00:05:37.770" style="s2">disguise there&#39;s the issue of the tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.979" end="00:05:40.260" style="s2">which comes out in Plato&#39;s philosophy so</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.770" end="00:05:41.970" style="s2">the person who has the sole most capable</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.260" end="00:05:44.460" style="s2">of being the philosopher king also if</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.970" end="00:05:46.979" style="s2">raised in an unfortunate context has the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.460" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">most power to be a horrible person</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.979" end="00:05:52.350" style="s2">basically and there&#39;s also the sorcerer</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.380" end="00:05:53.640" style="s2">you know there is no sorcerer who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.350" end="00:05:56.729" style="s2">first start off with a motivation</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.640" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">towards the good but the capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.729" end="00:05:59.930" style="s2">the powers that people get when they</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:02.610" style="s2">engage in altered state induction</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.930" end="00:06:04.890" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of value neutral you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.610" end="00:06:07.260" style="s2">to do some extra work to yoke them to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.890" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">some idea of the good otherwise you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.260" end="00:06:10.620" style="s2">end up with a person who has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:13.200" style="s2">power and a lot of potential for</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.620" end="00:06:15.690" style="s2">interpersonal manipulation right so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.200" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">person isn&#39;t trained in ethics and then</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.150" end="00:06:58.470" style="s2">use a term from Weber or charisma so I</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.250" end="00:07:15.420" style="s2">they&#39;re able to explore more of the of</p>

<p begin="00:07:57.150" end="00:08:02.430" style="s2">inspiration for people right yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.480" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">that is definitely a possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.430" end="00:08:07.710" style="s2">definitely a problem to go for and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:11.490" style="s2">the - of course problems are necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.710" end="00:08:15.060" style="s2">distinct either right no so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.490" end="00:08:17.100" style="s2">things that makes people susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.060" end="00:08:20.040" style="s2">the charisma of others is also a</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.040" end="00:08:24.900" style="s2">right and and also the the charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.950" end="00:08:27.300" style="s2">person this is kind of a weird paradox</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.900" end="00:08:31.020" style="s2">and this goes towards a traitor&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.300" end="00:08:33.450" style="s2">in the folly of fools that my capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.020" end="00:08:36.060" style="s2">for to deceive you goes up if I can</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.450" end="00:08:38.610" style="s2">deceive myself even more because if I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.060" end="00:08:41.280" style="s2">can keep secret from myself the fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.610" end="00:08:43.950" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing something deceptive that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.280" end="00:08:46.110" style="s2">actually enhances the confidence and all</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.950" end="00:08:48.390" style="s2">of the subtle cues that I&#39;m giving you</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.110" end="00:08:50.220" style="s2">when I&#39;m trying to manipulate and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.390" end="00:08:51.930" style="s2">control you right so I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.220" end="00:08:53.700" style="s2">the thing you&#39;re describing there is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.930" end="00:08:54.930" style="s2">character of the false prophet the one</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.700" end="00:08:56.310" style="s2">who thinks he&#39;s in line with</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.930" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">who says listen to me because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.310" end="00:09:00.690" style="s2">genuinely do have the answer right but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:02.910" style="s2">think so with the character of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.690" end="00:09:04.470" style="s2">sorcerer we have something else</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.910" end="00:09:06.899" style="s2">happening where that person can be</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.470" end="00:09:09.029" style="s2">genuinely maliciously motivated that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.899" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">person knows full well that they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.029" end="00:09:13.560" style="s2">utilizing charisma that they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:15.540" style="s2">metaphor rhetoric to manipulate you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.560" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that on purpose maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.540" end="00:09:18.870" style="s2">know your whole thing that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:21.000" style="s2">mentioned with wisdom is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.870" end="00:09:23.070" style="s2">this capacity to a see-through illusion</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.000" end="00:09:25.140" style="s2">and into truth right right if I can see</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.070" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">where you truly are if I can genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.140" end="00:09:28.290" style="s2">see where your emotions are and where</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:30.360" style="s2">your insecurities lie I have a much</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.290" end="00:09:35.520" style="s2">greater power to control and hurt you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.360" end="00:09:39.000" style="s2">yes yes yes it&#39;s funny wow that is so</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.520" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">timely so I was lecturing in psych 371</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.000" end="00:09:43.080" style="s2">remember that&#39;s the psychology of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:44.490" style="s2">course I teach at U of T and I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.080" end="00:09:46.470" style="s2">talking about various things and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.490" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">actually stopped and I said with this</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.470" end="00:09:51.540" style="s2">kind of ability I could actually be you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:52.980" style="s2">know terrific super villain in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.540" end="00:09:54.990" style="s2">ending in both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.980" end="00:09:57.540" style="s2">terrific you know really good but also</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.990" end="00:10:00.180" style="s2">really terror you know and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.540" end="00:10:03.060" style="s2">it was funny at the moment but there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.180" end="00:10:05.910" style="s2">a bit of a of psychological after chill</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.060" end="00:10:09.180" style="s2">and I like whoa I sort of brushed up</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.910" end="00:10:13.890" style="s2">against something there and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.180" end="00:10:16.200" style="s2">very very very palpable experience so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.890" end="00:10:17.339" style="s2">mean that renders to me very plausible</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.200" end="00:10:18.660" style="s2">the idea that people could become</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.339" end="00:10:19.230" style="s2">sorceress in the way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.660" end="00:10:24.810" style="s2">describing</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.230" end="00:10:27.089" style="s2">there&#39;s the false prophet what else what</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.810" end="00:10:30.089" style="s2">else what I mean isn&#39;t there also the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.089" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">possibility of people also just also</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.089" end="00:10:35.100" style="s2">getting sort of just overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.760" end="00:10:37.770" style="s2">things am i getting either something</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.100" end="00:10:41.970" style="s2">like experimental neurosis or learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.770" end="00:10:45.089" style="s2">helplessness because of you know they</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.970" end="00:10:47.400" style="s2">get exposed to state spaces within</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.089" end="00:10:50.279" style="s2">cognitive possibility that they cannot</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.400" end="00:10:52.589" style="s2">properly assimilate yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.279" end="00:10:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely a problem as well so</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.589" end="00:10:57.870" style="s2">with psychedelics especially psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.470" end="00:10:59.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve been looking at we referring</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.870" end="00:11:02.070" style="s2">loosely to the psycho to the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.610" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">community at large particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.070" end="00:11:06.390" style="s2">mystical experience yeah the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:08.430" style="s2">experience of divine Union yes which</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.390" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t the only mystical experience right</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.430" end="00:11:13.500" style="s2">body-based mystical experiences as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:15.990" style="s2">as more visionary prophetic states but</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.500" end="00:11:17.460" style="s2">this unit of state well its firstly</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.990" end="00:11:19.320" style="s2">really easy to study because it has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.460" end="00:11:22.620" style="s2">particular set of phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.320" end="00:11:24.750" style="s2">characteristics it also it also has an</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.620" end="00:11:27.510" style="s2">epistemological advantage which is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.750" end="00:11:29.580" style="s2">generally doesn&#39;t come with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.510" end="00:11:32.029" style="s2">heavy metaphysical statement like which</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.580" end="00:11:33.870" style="s2">makes it right right except that it does</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.029" end="00:11:35.970" style="s2">okay no fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.870" end="00:11:37.980" style="s2">it looks like it doesn&#39;t right it looks</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.970" end="00:11:39.750" style="s2">like it does again yeah the number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.980" end="00:11:41.700" style="s2">entities are involving and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.750" end="00:11:44.279" style="s2">describing something that&#39;s fairly sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.700" end="00:11:45.870" style="s2">of abstract please go ahead yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.279" end="00:11:47.820" style="s2">right in the sense that it is a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.870" end="00:11:54.270" style="s2">bit easier to get on board with from a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.820" end="00:11:55.980" style="s2">scientific perspective yeah um now one</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.270" end="00:11:58.020" style="s2">thing that I&#39;ve always sort of been</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.980" end="00:11:59.640" style="s2">harping on is an issue with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.020" end="00:12:01.860" style="s2">scientific framework that&#39;s come out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.640" end="00:12:03.270" style="s2">psychedelic research so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.860" end="00:12:04.500" style="s2">mystical experience questionnaire which</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.270" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">is what the people at John Hopkins are</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.500" end="00:12:09.750" style="s2">using one of the items on that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">questionnaire specifically is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.750" end="00:12:14.130" style="s2">felt in positive mood but that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:16.410" style="s2">completely ignores like the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.130" end="00:12:19.080" style="s2">Judaism for example where in as per</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.410" end="00:12:20.610" style="s2">proverbs wisdom lies in the fear of God</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.080" end="00:12:23.160" style="s2">or the fear of God is the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.610" end="00:12:26.279" style="s2">wisdom and I think that there is a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.160" end="00:12:28.410" style="s2">real way in which terror and horror and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.279" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">fear need to be accounted for when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.410" end="00:12:32.550" style="s2">thinking about the variety of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:35.790" style="s2">experiences so Otto Otto&#39;s notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.550" end="00:12:40.700" style="s2">numinous right yeah yeah contains within</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.700" end="00:12:49.470" style="s2">horror in the sense of a threatening</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.130" end="00:12:51.329" style="s2">sense that one is losing his grip on</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.470" end="00:12:53.190" style="s2">reality what is one&#39;s cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.190" end="00:12:56.910" style="s2">what I was alluding to a few minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.570" end="00:12:58.020" style="s2">so this seems directly pertinent so so</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.910" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.020" end="00:13:04.050" style="s2">sort of that new at least let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:05.670" style="s2">terms let&#39;s say there&#39;s let&#39;s let the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.050" end="00:13:08.190" style="s2">scientific community call what it calls</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.670" end="00:13:10.770" style="s2">the mystical but then we&#39;ll say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.190" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">there&#39;s there are numinous experiences</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.770" end="00:13:13.649" style="s2">just because I want to have different</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:15.720" style="s2">terms for talking about the anthers</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.649" end="00:13:18.209" style="s2">right I&#39;m not making any deep claims</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.720" end="00:13:20.760" style="s2">here this is merely pro-tem so for ease</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.209" end="00:13:22.110" style="s2">of communication right and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.760" end="00:13:26.100" style="s2">these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.110" end="00:13:27.690" style="s2">both within the repertoire of altered</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.100" end="00:13:29.370" style="s2">states of consciousness that allow</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.370" end="00:13:34.649" style="s2">transformations towards increased wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.760" end="00:13:35.640" style="s2">is that a fair way to put it yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.649" end="00:13:37.500" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.640" end="00:13:38.790" style="s2">both the loving-kindness kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.500" end="00:13:40.980" style="s2">experiences and the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.790" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">horrifying can both be wisdom promoting</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.980" end="00:13:43.079" style="s2">but not if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:44.640" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.079" end="00:13:47.310" style="s2">and you know to go back to the point</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.640" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">which got us here which was the one you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.310" end="00:13:51.089" style="s2">were making about people getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:52.709" style="s2">overwhelmed I think that&#39;s a very real</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.089" end="00:13:54.870" style="s2">possibility we had to look for and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.709" end="00:13:56.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a guy he&#39;s a professor of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.870" end="00:13:58.380" style="s2">Religious Studies his name is</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.250" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">Christopher desh he just put out a great</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.380" end="00:14:03.660" style="s2">book called LSD and the mind of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:05.700" style="s2">universe I definitely recommend anybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.660" end="00:14:07.230" style="s2">who&#39;s interested in seeing what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.700" end="00:14:09.329" style="s2">sort of darker side of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.230" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">exploration looks like explore that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.329" end="00:14:13.970" style="s2">particular book because he explores</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:16.649" style="s2">States so he did a series of experiments</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.970" end="00:14:18.870" style="s2">around the late 80s early 90s where he</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.649" end="00:14:20.430" style="s2">was trying to approach psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.870" end="00:14:21.480" style="s2">experiences as much like an analytical</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.430" end="00:14:23.670" style="s2">philosopher as possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.480" end="00:14:25.890" style="s2">I&#39;m so he do the same amount he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.670" end="00:14:27.630" style="s2">standardized the procedure he did you</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.890" end="00:14:29.269" style="s2">know about a decade of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.630" end="00:14:31.949" style="s2">experiments where he&#39;d go very deep into</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.269" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">these experiences doesn&#39;t try to map out</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.949" end="00:14:36.089" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there and he gets in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:38.310" style="s2">touch with a lot of like horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.089" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">terrifying experiences like where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.310" end="00:14:42.329" style="s2">confronted with an entity who like</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:44.760" style="s2">commands him to tear apart his dog</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.329" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">something like that and also he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.760" end="00:14:47.640" style="s2">immersed in like</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:50.010" style="s2">oceans of suffering I think he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.640" end="00:14:51.570" style="s2">the ocean of suffering and these are</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.010" end="00:14:54.420" style="s2">places that people can go and they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.570" end="00:14:57.300" style="s2">less or more mystical but one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.420" end="00:15:01.050" style="s2">he mentions in his book called I was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.300" end="00:15:03.149" style="s2">one that he released before this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.050" end="00:15:05.339" style="s2">has something to do with the dark night</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.149" end="00:15:08.130" style="s2">of the soul but unlike a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.339" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">the name is escaping me now but it has</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.130" end="00:15:12.630" style="s2">something to do with that but he</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:14.250" style="s2">mentions that one of the qualities that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.630" end="00:15:15.810" style="s2">most people associate with the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.250" end="00:15:18.149" style="s2">experience as for the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.810" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">research is that they often can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.149" end="00:15:21.720" style="s2">anything about it which is what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:23.070" style="s2">amenable to scientific researchers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.720" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">like oh you know it&#39;s just an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.070" end="00:15:26.850" style="s2">cognitive experience but base says you</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:29.790" style="s2">know if you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.850" end="00:15:32.010" style="s2">chances are you just got lost I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.790" end="00:15:33.540" style="s2">it&#39;s very good if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.010" end="00:15:35.670" style="s2">anything you can say about it then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.540" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">really hard to integrate that experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.670" end="00:15:39.540" style="s2">into your everyday life so it might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:42.780" style="s2">something that promotes a radical</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.540" end="00:15:44.580" style="s2">reorientation of your affect of your</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.780" end="00:15:46.110" style="s2">ability to relate to people but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.580" end="00:15:48.600" style="s2">just this you know Cloud of Unknowing</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.110" end="00:15:51.780" style="s2">that hangs in the background but if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.600" end="00:15:55.140" style="s2">look at for example bill Richards recent</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.780" end="00:15:57.450" style="s2">book sacred knowledge he talks about I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.140" end="00:15:59.370" style="s2">find it really funny the examples that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.450" end="00:16:00.510" style="s2">he uses for unitive experiences because</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.370" end="00:16:02.520" style="s2">a lot of them have like really rich</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.510" end="00:16:03.840" style="s2">mental imagery so they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.520" end="00:16:06.810" style="s2">already not the kind of experience he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.840" end="00:16:08.640" style="s2">saying they are but there is really no</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.810" end="00:16:10.890" style="s2">difficulty in people describing their</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.640" end="00:16:12.150" style="s2">unit of experiences if they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.890" end="00:16:13.500" style="s2">integrate that may have very clear</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.150" end="00:16:14.970" style="s2">language about it they might say for</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.500" end="00:16:16.980" style="s2">example there&#39;s a little bit more of</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.970" end="00:16:19.290" style="s2">this than I can render into words but</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.980" end="00:16:21.840" style="s2">they are still able to articulate most</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.290" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">of the experience it&#39;s like people have</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.840" end="00:16:27.270" style="s2">sort of ability to a intelligibly Ostend</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:30.960" style="s2">I noticed that when I was reading Steve</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.270" end="00:16:32.310" style="s2">Taylor&#39;s book what was it was it waking</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.960" end="00:16:34.980" style="s2">up early his book on awakening</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.310" end="00:16:36.540" style="s2">experiences although many people say</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.980" end="00:16:38.400" style="s2">there&#39;s something inevitable if they do</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.540" end="00:16:40.130" style="s2">as you say they do</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.400" end="00:16:42.300" style="s2">purport they are able to report</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.130" end="00:16:45.840" style="s2">transformations in their phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.300" end="00:16:47.640" style="s2">nevertheless now the inevitability is</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.840" end="00:16:49.050" style="s2">interesting as well so I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.640" end="00:16:51.090" style="s2">know there are definitely modes of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.050" end="00:16:52.950" style="s2">knowledge which are pre-linguistic of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.090" end="00:16:55.200" style="s2">course yeah although Bea&#39;s perspect I</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.950" end="00:16:57.900" style="s2">love participatory knowing if yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.200" end="00:16:59.790" style="s2">hard to you know sort of relate to other</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.900" end="00:17:02.220" style="s2">people how I might relate to you here</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.790" end="00:17:05.310" style="s2">and now this is the focal kernel of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.220" end="00:17:06.450" style="s2">particular interaction that&#39;s right but</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.310" end="00:17:07.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that that means that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.450" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">can&#39;t actually describe these things I</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.920" end="00:17:10.560" style="s2">don&#39;t think that they&#39;re as ineffable as</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:12.180" style="s2">we think we are I think that we just</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.560" end="00:17:14.760" style="s2">need to change our pista Milad djegal</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.180" end="00:17:17.730" style="s2">standards and right now literal language</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.760" end="00:17:19.590" style="s2">has a very high regard in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.730" end="00:17:20.940" style="s2">of valuable knowledge but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.590" end="00:17:22.350" style="s2">things that the introduction of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.940" end="00:17:24.210" style="s2">psychedelics and mindfulness in these</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.350" end="00:17:25.590" style="s2">other altering consciousness altering</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.210" end="00:17:27.810" style="s2">techniques are bringing into our</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.590" end="00:17:29.070" style="s2">awareness is that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.810" end="00:17:32.010" style="s2">different ways of communicating things</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.070" end="00:17:34.260" style="s2">and so I think artistic expression you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.010" end="00:17:35.580" style="s2">know a painting um oh um you know a poem</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.260" end="00:17:37.560" style="s2">I think it can much more readily a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.580" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">transmit to you the likeness of my</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.560" end="00:17:42.390" style="s2">seemingly ineffable experience in a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:45.180" style="s2">that I couldn&#39;t with just literal</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.390" end="00:17:47.580" style="s2">language so in Asiatic wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.180" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">Taoism and Buddhism come to mind poetry</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.580" end="00:17:51.330" style="s2">is where most of the fullest</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.020" end="00:17:53.880" style="s2">work is being done talented yet for</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.330" end="00:17:57.540" style="s2">example is just a an extended poem with</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.410" end="00:18:07.530" style="s2">philosophy so the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.480" end="00:18:09.500" style="s2">philosophy and poetry is not made in AZ</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.530" end="00:18:12.060" style="s2">attic philosophy the way it&#39;s made in</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.500" end="00:18:13.500" style="s2">Western philosophy right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.060" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">we&#39;re having a bit of a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.500" end="00:18:17.700" style="s2">in that so I&#39;ve been reading a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:21.240" style="s2">stuff about object-oriented ontology</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.700" end="00:18:22.740" style="s2">recently Oh Harman and Martin yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.240" end="00:18:25.620" style="s2">like these people a lot as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.740" end="00:18:27.420" style="s2">yes they have been this has been a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.620" end="00:18:29.660" style="s2">timely thing for me to discover these</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.420" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">particular theories because in</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.660" end="00:18:33.930" style="s2">object-oriented ontology Harmon says</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:35.790" style="s2">that we&#39;ve actually been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.930" end="00:18:37.290" style="s2">mistaken all along making philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.790" end="00:18:40.050" style="s2">this thing where we try to point as</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.290" end="00:18:41.220" style="s2">clearly as we can to a thing that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.050" end="00:18:42.450" style="s2">really what it can do and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.220" end="00:18:45.230" style="s2">really what it should be trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.450" end="00:18:47.310" style="s2">and within object-oriented ontology</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.230" end="00:18:50.700" style="s2">aesthetics is actually placed at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.310" end="00:18:52.980" style="s2">center because art and metaphor are ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.700" end="00:18:55.110" style="s2">that we can communicate the thing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.980" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">itself much more readily than we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.110" end="00:18:59.880" style="s2">with literal language right and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">Harmon I mean I think I&#39;d make a strong</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.880" end="00:19:05.460" style="s2">case that Harmon are used for that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:07.980" style="s2">is he argues for an inactive</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.460" end="00:19:11.250" style="s2">participatory notion of metaphor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.980" end="00:19:13.860" style="s2">actually the way in which I mysteriously</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.250" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">emerge from my own depths and also</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.860" end="00:19:19.380" style="s2">always mysteriously withdraw into my own</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:22.440" style="s2">depths right that gives me the enacted I</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.380" end="00:19:24.930" style="s2">I instantiate that I don&#39;t just refer to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.440" end="00:19:27.870" style="s2">it I instantiate that and that gives me</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.930" end="00:19:29.670" style="s2">right a participatory sense of how this</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.870" end="00:19:32.280" style="s2">thing is always a thing beyond itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.670" end="00:19:34.530" style="s2">how we&#39;d always how it&#39;s also emerging</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.280" end="00:19:36.780" style="s2">always emerging from its steps and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.530" end="00:19:38.790" style="s2">always withdrawing into its depths right</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.780" end="00:19:40.830" style="s2">and another thing that I like about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.790" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">is that he also claims that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.830" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">relational experience between myself and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:47.430" style="s2">an object and my self to myself as an</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">object is not unique to human beings but</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.430" end="00:19:51.930" style="s2">also you know these two books are also</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:54.570" style="s2">somewhat withdrawn from each other at</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.930" end="00:19:56.820" style="s2">all yeah yeah that&#39;s one of his big</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.570" end="00:19:57.900" style="s2">criticisms of phenomenology but and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.820" end="00:20:00.700" style="s2">that&#39;s the way he&#39;s trying to in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.900" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">ways break from Heidegger as he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.700" end="00:20:05.830" style="s2">he thinks that I mean his argument is</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:08.170" style="s2">that if there are no relations like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.830" end="00:20:09.820" style="s2">between objects then were ultimately not</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.170" end="00:20:13.090" style="s2">realists that&#39;s part of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.820" end="00:20:14.470" style="s2">right right but yeah Harman is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.090" end="00:20:16.150" style="s2">the opposite he says this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.470" end="00:20:17.890" style="s2">something that&#39;s very special and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.150" end="00:20:20.050" style="s2">fact it just is a part of reality that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.890" end="00:20:21.460" style="s2">there is this sort of mutual withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.050" end="00:20:22.990" style="s2">from all objects that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.460" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">things aren&#39;t real it just means that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.990" end="00:20:28.900" style="s2">things are a little weirder than we</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:32.050" style="s2">might hope that they were yes so and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.900" end="00:20:34.990" style="s2">you think that the object-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.050" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">ontology is basically providing us with</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.990" end="00:20:40.530" style="s2">a new epistemological and metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:44.560" style="s2">framework that will revalorisé</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.530" end="00:20:46.360" style="s2">aesthetics as a way of under I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.560" end="00:20:48.460" style="s2">does it revalorisé aesthetics or does it</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.360" end="00:20:50.670" style="s2">really I see Harman is really blurring I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.460" end="00:20:52.840" style="s2">know he uses that language so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.670" end="00:20:54.850" style="s2">understand why you&#39;re saying that but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.840" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">see him is actually deeply blurring the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.850" end="00:21:00.190" style="s2">lines between aesthetics metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:04.750" style="s2">epistemology a part of the argument is</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.190" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">that separation is in fact inadequate in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.750" end="00:21:09.160" style="s2">an important way yeah I think I could</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:11.530" style="s2">get behind that because the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.160" end="00:21:13.300" style="s2">basically is well how do we know things</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.530" end="00:21:14.980" style="s2">right there is something in here which</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.300" end="00:21:17.260" style="s2">is trying to address how we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.980" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">epistemic lis bound and if the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.260" end="00:21:22.030" style="s2">parameters of our epistemology are such</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:25.500" style="s2">that it&#39;s much more useful to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.030" end="00:21:28.690" style="s2">the universe if we personify it as some</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.500" end="00:21:30.370" style="s2">anthropomorphic thing then that has</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.690" end="00:21:32.920" style="s2">priority over the literal description</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.370" end="00:21:34.750" style="s2">because the metaphorical rendering gives</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.920" end="00:21:36.700" style="s2">us a greater capacity to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.750" end="00:21:38.740" style="s2">something it makes a worldview viable</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.700" end="00:21:40.120" style="s2">over longer periods of time and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.740" end="00:21:43.450" style="s2">that when we&#39;re looking at what should</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.120" end="00:21:45.100" style="s2">have a center in our epistemology we</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.450" end="00:21:46.780" style="s2">should be looking in terms of what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.100" end="00:21:50.560" style="s2">viable for the longest period of time</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.780" end="00:21:52.060" style="s2">because if like you know be so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.560" end="00:21:53.980" style="s2">another philosopher who really lines up</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.060" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">well with these kinds of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.980" end="00:21:59.110" style="s2">thinking his name is Federico Campania</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.960" end="00:22:01.030" style="s2">and I gave you one of his talks to add</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.110" end="00:22:02.950" style="s2">in the description of this video yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.030" end="00:22:04.780" style="s2">so he already in one of his books I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.950" end="00:22:06.730" style="s2">haven&#39;t read it yet though yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.780" end="00:22:08.890" style="s2">amazing would recommend to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.730" end="00:22:10.780" style="s2">it&#39;s very elegant and he really fully</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.890" end="00:22:14.140" style="s2">embraces this sort of aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.780" end="00:22:17.530" style="s2">metaphysical blend and so he bases his</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.140" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">his theories on an emanation astir you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.530" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">via Platonists and then for each of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">emanations that come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:26.110" style="s2">worldviews he describes he attributes a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:28.210" style="s2">particular character right and that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.110" end="00:22:29.860" style="s2">know gives us an idea of well how do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.210" end="00:22:31.780" style="s2">relate to this thing how do we relate to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.860" end="00:22:34.210" style="s2">this particular aspect of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.780" end="00:22:35.650" style="s2">particular reality system so the reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.210" end="00:22:37.570" style="s2">system sees describing in his book</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.650" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">Technic and magic are technic and magic</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.570" end="00:22:42.610" style="s2">right and so Technic is building on</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:45.310" style="s2">Heidegger and his analysis of technology</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.610" end="00:22:48.310" style="s2">and at the center of Technic is absolute</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.310" end="00:22:49.930" style="s2">language so that&#39;s very much dominant in</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.310" end="00:22:51.940" style="s2">the sort of scientific worldview we</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.930" end="00:22:54.790" style="s2">think that we can break everything down</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.940" end="00:22:56.830" style="s2">into something like a set of atomic</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.790" end="00:22:58.930" style="s2">linguistic units that everything is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.830" end="00:23:00.820" style="s2">governed by rational laws and that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.930" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">can reduce everything downwards into</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.820" end="00:23:06.250" style="s2">these sort of sentential linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.360" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">logical laws but then on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.250" end="00:23:12.220" style="s2">there&#39;s magic which has at its centre</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:15.310" style="s2">ineffable being the thing that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.220" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">immediately spoken just the simple</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.310" end="00:23:20.020" style="s2">acknowledgement of the here and now</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:22.090" style="s2">and what that view of reality promotes</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.020" end="00:23:24.190" style="s2">is a sort of wonder as sort of awe that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.090" end="00:23:25.900" style="s2">everything is always overflowing what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.190" end="00:23:27.070" style="s2">can possibly know and therefore there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.900" end="00:23:29.260" style="s2">a bit of a humility that comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.070" end="00:23:30.310" style="s2">that as well yes yes and he argues that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.260" end="00:23:32.740" style="s2">a lot of the issues that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.310" end="00:23:35.110" style="s2">now the meaning crisis these sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.740" end="00:23:37.210" style="s2">know political conflict issues those can</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.110" end="00:23:39.340" style="s2">be more readily addressed if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.210" end="00:23:41.950" style="s2">these sort of reality systems that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.340" end="00:23:43.660" style="s2">are implementing within us so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.950" end="00:23:46.210" style="s2">go too much in that direction but I do</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.660" end="00:23:47.470" style="s2">want to at least highlight let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.210" end="00:23:51.250" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can bring it back around</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.470" end="00:23:57.100" style="s2">so is the is the argument that taking a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.250" end="00:24:00.940" style="s2">look at these emerging I&#39;ll just call</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.100" end="00:24:03.010" style="s2">them philosophies in right the like</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.940" end="00:24:05.070" style="s2">object-oriented ontology and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.010" end="00:24:10.800" style="s2">related things around it are you</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.070" end="00:24:13.510" style="s2">proposing that that gives us a better</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.800" end="00:24:18.310" style="s2">conceptual vocabulary better theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.510" end="00:24:21.250" style="s2">grammar for helping people to explicate</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.310" end="00:24:22.930" style="s2">elucidate and integrate what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.250" end="00:24:25.540" style="s2">when they have various altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.930" end="00:24:27.850" style="s2">consciousness yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.540" end="00:24:31.540" style="s2">okay so I think that&#39;s great and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.850" end="00:24:34.390" style="s2">that makes that would also given what</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.540" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">you said about on Wonder right that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.390" end="00:24:38.470" style="s2">those of course I have well in in Plato</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:42.190" style="s2">and Socrates they&#39;ve been deeply linked</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.470" end="00:24:44.980" style="s2">to wisdom and honing your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.190" end="00:24:48.790" style="s2">realize what is significant as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.980" end="00:24:51.790" style="s2">to making evident what you think is just</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.790" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">true right so a sort of knowledge wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.790" end="00:24:57.310" style="s2">to string distinction along that lines</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:59.500" style="s2">so here&#39;s the question then how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.310" end="00:25:02.380" style="s2">how do we I think that&#39;s a good argument</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:05.590" style="s2">by the way then but how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.380" end="00:25:08.410" style="s2">again without just giving license to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.590" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">people to fall into self-deception can</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.410" end="00:25:12.610" style="s2">follow to sorcerous manipulation and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:15.940" style="s2">fall into false prophecy how do how do</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.610" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">we so what my question is if we how do</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.940" end="00:25:20.350" style="s2">we if if you&#39;ll allow me to expand the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:21.820" style="s2">notion of rationality to mean systematic</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.350" end="00:25:23.920" style="s2">and reliable overcoming of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.820" end="00:25:25.840" style="s2">self-deception especially self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.920" end="00:25:27.940" style="s2">that ultimately might not just be self</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.840" end="00:25:31.150" style="s2">harming but harming of others how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.940" end="00:25:33.150" style="s2">bring rationality into that way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.150" end="00:25:35.770" style="s2">thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.150" end="00:25:37.690" style="s2">okay so rationality is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.770" end="00:25:39.280" style="s2">thing and you know I want to just first</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.690" end="00:25:40.930" style="s2">highlight the fact that rationality</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.280" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t inherently mean this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.930" end="00:25:44.440" style="s2">like formal logic kind of way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:46.180" style="s2">thinking and and I indicated that right</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.440" end="00:25:48.970" style="s2">away I mean if there&#39;s rationality that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.180" end="00:25:50.590" style="s2">extends beyond argumentation in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.970" end="00:25:52.500" style="s2">clearly argue that has to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.590" end="00:25:54.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s gonna be rationalities of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.500" end="00:25:55.900" style="s2">respectable and participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.520" end="00:25:58.030" style="s2">rationalities that don&#39;t work in terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.900" end="00:25:59.740" style="s2">of argumentation but work in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.030" end="00:26:01.420" style="s2">attention work in terms of processes of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.740" end="00:26:03.070" style="s2">identification work in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.420" end="00:26:04.600" style="s2">processes of aspiration all of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.070" end="00:26:06.670" style="s2">stuff and there&#39;s other people arguing</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.600" end="00:26:09.430" style="s2">this agnes collards book aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.670" end="00:26:10.750" style="s2">argues for a whole new form of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.430" end="00:26:13.300" style="s2">rationality it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.750" end="00:26:14.730" style="s2">transformation mmm-hmm so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.300" end="00:26:19.930" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s two links that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.730" end="00:26:23.470" style="s2">bring into this space of reasons one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.930" end="00:26:25.960" style="s2">them is a ontological argument and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.470" end="00:26:29.350" style="s2">other one is a sort of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.960" end="00:26:30.820" style="s2">functional argument sure okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.350" end="00:26:34.210" style="s2">first one has to do I think with well</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.820" end="00:26:36.790" style="s2">how do we connect to the real yeah now I</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.210" end="00:26:38.530" style="s2">think that the cognitive continuum that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.790" end="00:26:39.070" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about this function</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.530" end="00:26:42.639" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.070" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">that involves insight flow and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.639" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">mystical experience right what I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:48.039" style="s2">these are doing are linking us up with</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.860" style="s2">the real I think that they give us a</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.039" end="00:26:52.570" style="s2">capacity to you know see through our own</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.860" end="00:26:54.399" style="s2">biases see through our own illusions to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.570" end="00:26:56.529" style="s2">break our frames and to flexibly remake</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.399" end="00:27:00.309" style="s2">our frames in relation to that which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.529" end="00:27:02.500" style="s2">real now I think that an important step</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.309" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">in making the cognitive continuum do</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.500" end="00:27:06.460" style="s2">this is integrating it with much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:08.259" style="s2">embodied practice of course of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.460" end="00:27:10.450" style="s2">that there is like a sort of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.259" end="00:27:13.029" style="s2">right hemisphere dominance in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.450" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">cognitive continuum and an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.029" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">thing about mindfulness meditation for</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:19.690" style="s2">example is that it seems to well you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:21.519" style="s2">know mindfulness in general it helps to</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.690" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">you know give you this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.519" end="00:27:26.679" style="s2">flexibly reorient to be more cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:28.659" style="s2">flexible to not be so taken by your own</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.679" end="00:27:30.159" style="s2">biases and such to accept your own</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.659" end="00:27:31.539" style="s2">emotions and to not like it too wrapped</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.159" end="00:27:34.269" style="s2">up and what your emotions present to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.539" end="00:27:35.860" style="s2">is being true and there&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.269" end="00:27:38.649" style="s2">connection with mindfulness meditation</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.860" end="00:27:42.309" style="s2">to the right anterior insula which is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.649" end="00:27:44.740" style="s2">part of your brain involved in embodied</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.309" end="00:27:46.389" style="s2">awareness if your reception yeah and now</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.740" end="00:27:48.519" style="s2">she does have direct links it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.389" end="00:27:50.769" style="s2">maintaining constant informational</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.519" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">updates from visceral signals in your</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.769" end="00:27:53.950" style="s2">stomach yes yes yes yes and so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:56.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about the last few</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.950" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">days is that if we can have a clear flow</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.440" end="00:28:00.789" style="s2">between this brain body Network then we</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:02.909" style="s2">might be able to just have more</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.789" end="00:28:05.830" style="s2">computational power at our disposal I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.909" end="00:28:09.190" style="s2">think that&#39;s like I mean yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.830" end="00:28:12.669" style="s2">and I think I think many of many Taoist</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.190" end="00:28:14.980" style="s2">practices like Tai Chi Chuan comes</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.669" end="00:28:16.779" style="s2">readily to mind about trying I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.980" end="00:28:20.519" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which you can think</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.779" end="00:28:22.950" style="s2">about like what they call Chi as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.519" end="00:28:26.259" style="s2">resonance between that kind of interior</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.950" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">flow like you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.259" end="00:28:31.419" style="s2">connectivity and that being in resonance</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:33.250" style="s2">with your sort of coupling to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.419" end="00:28:35.889" style="s2">environment and those two are in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.250" end="00:28:39.610" style="s2">kind of synchrony with each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.889" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">powerful way right so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.610" end="00:28:44.230" style="s2">problem after you train this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:45.909" style="s2">network to you know have increased</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.230" end="00:28:48.940" style="s2">resonance within your sort of fully</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.909" end="00:28:50.019" style="s2">embodied network of processing and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.940" end="00:28:51.789" style="s2">trying to get that to sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.019" end="00:28:52.690" style="s2">mashup with the world you can&#39;t just do</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.789" end="00:28:54.300" style="s2">this as an entirely in</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.690" end="00:28:57.070" style="s2">kernel process right you need to follow</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.300" end="00:28:58.450" style="s2">Hogarth&#39;s recommendations for educating</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.070" end="00:29:00.730" style="s2">your intuition and make sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.450" end="00:29:02.140" style="s2">putting yourself within feedback</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.730" end="00:29:03.940" style="s2">environments that are giving you correct</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.140" end="00:29:05.320" style="s2">and accurate feedback right right right</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.940" end="00:29:06.700" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just about doing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.320" end="00:29:08.470" style="s2">individual practice it&#39;s also about</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.700" end="00:29:10.510" style="s2">doing the individual practice such that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.470" end="00:29:11.740" style="s2">you become more sensitive to feedback in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.510" end="00:29:15.250" style="s2">the environment and then putting</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.740" end="00:29:17.560" style="s2">yourself in environments that right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.250" end="00:29:19.750" style="s2">so I think circling actually is great at</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.560" end="00:29:21.970" style="s2">doing this well one of the warm-ups for</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.750" end="00:29:24.670" style="s2">circling that I&#39;ve been really enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.970" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">is you&#39;ll sit with one other individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.670" end="00:29:28.270" style="s2">you you&#39;ll have to say um so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:29.890" style="s2">observing say that you&#39;re wearing</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.270" end="00:29:33.040" style="s2">glasses which makes me think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.890" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">perhaps you like to read a lot that land</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.040" end="00:29:36.730" style="s2">and the person says yes or no right</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:38.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not often in our regular social</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.730" end="00:29:40.810" style="s2">environments do we get a chance to check</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.800" end="00:29:42.670" style="s2">our perceptions about other people so</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.810" end="00:29:44.380" style="s2">this practice allows us to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.670" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">having this inference based on what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.380" end="00:29:48.310" style="s2">observe is that observation correct the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.800" style="s2">other person has a chance to give us</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.310" end="00:29:53.560" style="s2">feedback about that so I think something</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.800" end="00:29:56.440" style="s2">like that in conjunction with a practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.560" end="00:29:58.900" style="s2">like mindfulness is a great way to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.440" end="00:30:01.480" style="s2">this flexible insight based cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.900" end="00:30:03.370" style="s2">continuum to link up and actually latch</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.480" end="00:30:05.020" style="s2">on to the real it&#39;s not enough to just</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.370" end="00:30:06.850" style="s2">train that function it has to actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.020" end="00:30:09.460" style="s2">latch on to the real outside of oneself</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.850" end="00:30:10.930" style="s2">yes just as possible that you can sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.460" end="00:30:12.460" style="s2">of latch on to these worlds of your own</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.930" end="00:30:14.710" style="s2">making and become incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.460" end="00:30:22.260" style="s2">self-deceptive yeah yeah for sure for</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.710" end="00:30:28.300" style="s2">sure for sure so it would it also be</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.260" end="00:30:30.730" style="s2">important to have what am i when looking</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.300" end="00:30:33.940" style="s2">for a complimentary practice in which</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.730" end="00:30:40.360" style="s2">you are also spending time for in</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.940" end="00:30:42.970" style="s2">dialogue trying to get a more what am i</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.360" end="00:30:44.200" style="s2">trying to say I don&#39;t want to just say</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.970" end="00:30:50.260" style="s2">Co here because that she sounds logical</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.200" end="00:30:52.300" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what word I want but a you</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.260" end="00:30:56.110" style="s2">want to do a something on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.300" end="00:30:58.120" style="s2">ontological side where you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.110" end="00:31:00.790" style="s2">get clear about what your implicit</p>

<p begin="00:31:00.790" end="00:31:05.919" style="s2">self and other criticism as possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.400" end="00:31:08.179" style="s2">bringing as much</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.919" end="00:31:10.009" style="s2">self-corrective individual and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.179" end="00:31:12.679" style="s2">distributed cognition to bear on your</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.009" end="00:31:17.629" style="s2">implicit worldview your implicit</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.679" end="00:31:19.190" style="s2">ontology and also try to get it to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.629" end="00:31:20.899" style="s2">internalize the capacity to being</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.190" end="00:31:23.059" style="s2">self-correcting so that your ontology</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.899" end="00:31:25.639" style="s2">also isn&#39;t just sort of ossified because</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.059" end="00:31:27.499" style="s2">i could see somebody right doing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.639" end="00:31:30.979" style="s2">work like you said and then doing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.499" end="00:31:32.629" style="s2">Hogarth stuff that Leo and Aaron and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.979" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">talked about in the article and they do</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.629" end="00:31:36.100" style="s2">all that but nevertheless they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:38.809" style="s2">of committed to a particular ossified</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.100" end="00:31:42.950" style="s2">worldview and that&#39;s also going to lock</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.809" end="00:31:43.729" style="s2">them down in important ways yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.950" end="00:31:49.159" style="s2">that&#39;s where the ontological argument</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.729" end="00:31:52.759" style="s2">comes in so that&#39;s a great bridge so you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.159" end="00:31:55.720" style="s2">know for a while I had been working with</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.759" end="00:31:57.320" style="s2">the Buddha&#39;s pragmatic assessment of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.720" end="00:31:58.340" style="s2">enlightenment where you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.320" end="00:32:00.169" style="s2">talk about the metaphysics too much</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.340" end="00:32:01.849" style="s2">because it&#39;s not that practical but as</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.169" end="00:32:03.259" style="s2">I&#39;ve been reading object-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.849" end="00:32:04.609" style="s2">ontology and as I&#39;ve been reading the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.259" end="00:32:05.989" style="s2">work of Roberto Unger I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.609" end="00:32:07.190" style="s2">realizing that no actually we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.989" end="00:32:08.509" style="s2">get the metaphysics right because if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.190" end="00:32:10.460" style="s2">don&#39;t get the metaphysics right then we</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.509" end="00:32:12.109" style="s2">might just be latching on to some world</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.460" end="00:32:13.820" style="s2">of our own imagining okay well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.109" end="00:32:15.619" style="s2">slow down here for a sec okay this</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.820" end="00:32:16.879" style="s2">you&#39;re invoking a normative term and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.619" end="00:32:18.919" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna come with all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.879" end="00:32:21.139" style="s2">connotations does right mean final</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.919" end="00:32:22.549" style="s2">complete comprehensive what does right</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.139" end="00:32:25.999" style="s2">mean the metaphysics getting the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.549" end="00:32:29.090" style="s2">metaphysics right are we looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.999" end="00:32:31.849" style="s2">kind of cognitive closure here no no</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.090" end="00:32:34.489" style="s2">okay so for example look um Robert one</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.849" end="00:32:35.570" style="s2">of the main things and Roberto hungers</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.489" end="00:32:37.429" style="s2">metaphysics which is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.570" end="00:32:40.609" style="s2">important is that the future is open</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.429" end="00:32:42.289" style="s2">that change is the only constant mmm so</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.609" end="00:32:43.789" style="s2">there&#39;s no closure in fact we always</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.289" end="00:32:45.979" style="s2">have to be sort of updating our</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.789" end="00:32:47.389" style="s2">understandings because we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.979" end="00:32:49.460" style="s2">understand the things in themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.389" end="00:32:51.799" style="s2">because as we&#39;ve talked about things are</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.460" end="00:32:53.899" style="s2">always somewhat withdrawn well do is</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.799" end="00:32:56.840" style="s2">reveal to ourselves what our current</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.899" end="00:32:58.190" style="s2">relationship with things are so we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.840" end="00:33:01.210" style="s2">to take seriously our epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.190" end="00:33:03.889" style="s2">boundedness and we have to use that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.210" end="00:33:05.720" style="s2">think like that quality of epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.889" end="00:33:07.539" style="s2">boundedness should have a central role</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.720" end="00:33:09.529" style="s2">in our understanding of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.539" end="00:33:11.299" style="s2">because it gives us a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.529" end="00:33:13.249" style="s2">humility right it helps us to step down</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.299" end="00:33:15.859" style="s2">from the idea that perhaps we do have</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.249" end="00:33:17.859" style="s2">the final answer because yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.859" end="00:33:19.280" style="s2">think there really is a final answer I</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.859" end="00:33:21.410" style="s2">agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.280" end="00:33:23.450" style="s2">agree with you so but notice how once</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.410" end="00:33:25.930" style="s2">you give up sort of an epistemology of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.450" end="00:33:28.250" style="s2">certainty or completeness or closure</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.930" end="00:33:31.610" style="s2">specifying what getting it right is</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.250" end="00:33:32.930" style="s2">becomes very problematic in some ways so</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.610" end="00:33:34.130" style="s2">I would say that instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.930" end="00:33:35.210" style="s2">metaphysics of certainty we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.130" end="00:33:37.610" style="s2">metaphor this metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.210" end="00:33:40.370" style="s2">authenticity mmm we don&#39;t have to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.610" end="00:33:42.410" style="s2">certain literal language about what the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.370" end="00:33:43.880" style="s2">things were in touch with are to know</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.410" end="00:33:47.300" style="s2">that we are genuinely in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.880" end="00:33:48.380" style="s2">things beyond ourselves so this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.300" end="00:33:49.460" style="s2">like something I was talking with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.380" end="00:33:50.890" style="s2">Hall about that we moved to an</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.460" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">epistemology where we emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.890" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">continuity of contact rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:34:01.610" style="s2">coherent completeness of assertion yes</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:03.080" style="s2">yes so I want to flesh out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.610" end="00:34:05.270" style="s2">of some stuff that I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.080" end="00:34:10.880" style="s2">about with Timothy Morton&#39;s idea of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.270" end="00:34:12.380" style="s2">hyper objects right so let&#39;s see where</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.880" end="00:34:13.580" style="s2">to start this is like a pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.380" end="00:34:14.450" style="s2">argument I mean I guess I gotta start</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.580" end="00:34:16.250" style="s2">with the most sensational</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.450" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">sensationalist statement and step down</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.250" end="00:34:21.560" style="s2">from there okay so everybody everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:23.780" style="s2">should caveat okay right go ahead okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.560" end="00:34:24.679" style="s2">so I think that in order to effectively</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.780" end="00:34:26.300" style="s2">integrate altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.679" end="00:34:31.010" style="s2">consciousness into our culture we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.300" end="00:34:31.490" style="s2">to admit that the gods are real so what</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.010" end="00:34:33.500" style="s2">are the gods</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.490" end="00:34:36.470" style="s2">okay so Timothy Morton has this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.500" end="00:34:38.659" style="s2">a hyper object so a hyper object is</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.470" end="00:34:41.810" style="s2">built on top of Harmons idea of what an</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.659" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">object is so Harmon first let&#39;s flesh</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.810" end="00:34:46.550" style="s2">that out a little bit says that objects</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.409" style="s2">are kind of a middling ground between</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.550" end="00:34:51.409" style="s2">two tendencies in philosophical thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.409" end="00:34:53.000" style="s2">to reduce objects either too little or</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.409" end="00:34:56.080" style="s2">too much verbs</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.000" end="00:34:58.520" style="s2">Harmon says that you can either try to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.080" end="00:35:00.080" style="s2">undermine an object by trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.520" end="00:35:02.210" style="s2">it down in its into its constituent</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.080" end="00:35:03.980" style="s2">components its atoms and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.210" end="00:35:06.680" style="s2">the problem of over mining where we say</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.980" end="00:35:08.840" style="s2">that this thing is only its actions or</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.680" end="00:35:10.910" style="s2">its relationships it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.840" end="00:35:12.290" style="s2">node in the network of relations right</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.910" end="00:35:13.910" style="s2">and then it like passes away like bruno</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.290" end="00:35:15.380" style="s2">latour i guess is the guy who argues for</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.910" end="00:35:18.160" style="s2">that mostly and i think even in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.380" end="00:35:20.600" style="s2">Buddhist metaphysics this concept yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.160" end="00:35:24.080" style="s2">there&#39;s I think there&#39;s versions of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.600" end="00:35:27.050" style="s2">in in Nagas or maybe in North Korea or</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.080" end="00:35:28.940" style="s2">at least you know the metaphors of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.050" end="00:35:30.620" style="s2">indras net and things like that right</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.940" end="00:35:33.380" style="s2">everything is like relationally</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.620" end="00:35:35.299" style="s2">dependent there is like no thing so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.380" end="00:35:37.250" style="s2">what you could look at as an over mining</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.299" end="00:35:38.690" style="s2">view so he says rather that there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.250" end="00:35:42.069" style="s2">something in the middle of these two</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.690" end="00:35:44.299" style="s2">which is the object and that object is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.069" end="00:35:46.609" style="s2">always a little bit sort of outside of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.299" end="00:35:48.140" style="s2">our capacity to fully grasp it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.609" end="00:35:49.970" style="s2">always an element of it that withdrawals</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.140" end="00:35:51.980" style="s2">but based on our relationships with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.970" end="00:35:55.069" style="s2">object certain parts of it show up to us</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.980" end="00:35:56.599" style="s2">in such a way that we can act on them</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.069" end="00:35:58.609" style="s2">because that&#39;s also how perception</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.599" end="00:36:01.430" style="s2">emerges right perception emerges in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.609" end="00:36:04.390" style="s2">organism environment relationships it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.430" end="00:36:06.410" style="s2">sort of pulled into our awareness via</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.390" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">consistent learning through sensory</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.410" end="00:36:11.299" style="s2">motor loops so that&#39;s that&#39;s what an</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:13.759" style="s2">object is it&#39;s this thing which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.299" end="00:36:17.180" style="s2">only its parts and it isn&#39;t only its</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.759" end="00:36:18.740" style="s2">actions but it&#39;s this sort of middle</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.180" end="00:36:21.769" style="s2">ground between those things so some</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.740" end="00:36:24.079" style="s2">philosophers are also talking of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.769" end="00:36:27.190" style="s2">intrinsic nature of a thing trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.079" end="00:36:30.140" style="s2">find a place in between components and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.190" end="00:36:32.210" style="s2">network of relations this is coming up</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.140" end="00:36:35.329" style="s2">for example in new arguments about</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.210" end="00:36:37.640" style="s2">consciousness wrestling in monism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.329" end="00:36:39.259" style="s2">things like that right okay go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.640" end="00:36:40.460" style="s2">yeah so I like that you brought that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.259" end="00:36:42.890" style="s2">term in so yes you can say that there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.460" end="00:36:44.299" style="s2">an essence to a thing but you and I only</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.890" end="00:36:45.559" style="s2">have an eye Doss of the thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.299" end="00:36:48.710" style="s2">the real object and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.559" end="00:36:51.049" style="s2">sensual object of our imagining so then</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.710" end="00:36:52.700" style="s2">we get into hyper objects which are not</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.049" end="00:36:54.380" style="s2">something that human beings can ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.700" end="00:36:57.079" style="s2">fully experience here and now</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.380" end="00:36:59.299" style="s2">so Timothy Morton refers to climate</p>

<p begin="00:36:59.299" end="00:37:02.569" style="s2">concerned evolution would also be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.220" end="00:37:05.029" style="s2">hyper object yeah you could say</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.569" end="00:37:07.279" style="s2">evolution the agricultural revolution I</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.029" end="00:37:10.369" style="s2">think also counts for Morton he has a</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.279" end="00:37:12.740" style="s2">book about that Harmon talks about I</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.369" end="00:37:18.019" style="s2">think what it was it the British East</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.740" end="00:37:20.059" style="s2">India Company that&#39;s um that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.019" end="00:37:21.470" style="s2">example he takes from Leibniz because it</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.059" end="00:37:23.210" style="s2">would argue against Leibniz who says</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.470" end="00:37:25.190" style="s2">that that&#39;s ridiculous the British East</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.210" end="00:37:26.569" style="s2">India Company isn&#39;t a thing but what</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.190" end="00:37:28.009" style="s2">Harmons getting at is the classics are</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.569" end="00:37:29.210" style="s2">the emergentism argument there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.009" end="00:37:32.569" style="s2">something that emerges from these</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.210" end="00:37:33.769" style="s2">relationships which is the thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.569" end="00:37:35.059" style="s2">know you could replace all of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.769" end="00:37:36.109" style="s2">and it could still be the same thing so</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.059" end="00:37:40.460" style="s2">that&#39;s how we know it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.109" end="00:37:41.690" style="s2">components right now hyper objects are</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.460" end="00:37:42.769" style="s2">really interesting because those are</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.690" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">also something that we have to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.769" end="00:37:46.760" style="s2">but they put a very different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:48.550" style="s2">epistemic burden on us</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.760" end="00:37:51.710" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of conflict about</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.550" end="00:37:53.300" style="s2">global warming people somehow think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.710" end="00:37:54.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like not a thing even though we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.300" end="00:37:56.570" style="s2">like see very clear trends and our</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.770" end="00:37:58.490" style="s2">statistical and mathematical analyses</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.570" end="00:37:59.630" style="s2">but just because it&#39;s a different sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.490" end="00:38:03.230" style="s2">of thing that we&#39;re not really used to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.630" end="00:38:06.350" style="s2">relating to there is it seems a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.230" end="00:38:08.420" style="s2">towards not really fully getting the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.350" end="00:38:10.520" style="s2">fact that this is actually a thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.420" end="00:38:12.140" style="s2">because we&#39;re used to things relative to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.520" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">human perception you know this computer</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.140" end="00:38:16.100" style="s2">this Mouse that I&#39;m looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">are usually something that we can grasp</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.100" end="00:38:20.630" style="s2">point to but for something like global</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">warming it&#39;s so big and outside of our</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.630" end="00:38:24.470" style="s2">comprehension so can I ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:26.570" style="s2">here because I&#39;ve thought about this too</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.470" end="00:38:27.980" style="s2">why is it because I think this argument</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.570" end="00:38:29.960" style="s2">is on the right track so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.980" end="00:38:31.730" style="s2">meant to derail why is it that people</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.960" end="00:38:33.290" style="s2">have difficulty with the hyper object</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.730" end="00:38:35.870" style="s2">like global warming but they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.290" end="00:38:40.130" style="s2">have no difficulty with a hyper object</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.870" end="00:38:41.810" style="s2">like the Internet hmm so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.130" end="00:38:44.990" style="s2">the Internet is still smaller than hyper</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.810" end="00:38:47.000" style="s2">objects and it also is something which</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.990" end="00:38:49.100" style="s2">really matches up with the metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.000" end="00:38:51.350" style="s2">that we&#39;re using so network theory is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.100" end="00:38:52.760" style="s2">like super big and people love AI and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.350" end="00:38:54.230" style="s2">all of that and we know that brains have</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.760" end="00:38:56.420" style="s2">neural networks um so I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.230" end="00:38:58.670" style="s2">much more intelligible thing for people</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.420" end="00:39:01.250" style="s2">mmm global warming it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.670" end="00:39:02.870" style="s2">diffuse and like it&#39;s not an object that</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.250" end="00:39:06.830" style="s2">we really come into contact with usually</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.870" end="00:39:09.560" style="s2">you know I&#39;ll even easy so the it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.830" end="00:39:11.000" style="s2">just it&#39;s not just a hyper object nurse</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.560" end="00:39:12.470" style="s2">if I can put it that way I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.000" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">say objectivity because I will have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.470" end="00:39:18.200" style="s2">wrong meaning the hyper object Ness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">also then a difficulty in framing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.200" end="00:39:23.300" style="s2">there&#39;s right okay so that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:26.810" style="s2">important too so that&#39;s where the gods</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.300" end="00:39:29.060" style="s2">come in okay please go ahead that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.810" end="00:39:30.830" style="s2">we frame it and we look at these things</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.060" end="00:39:33.830" style="s2">that are bigger than ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.830" end="00:39:35.390" style="s2">entities beings that have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.830" end="00:39:37.910" style="s2">determinate force they have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.390" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">personality insofar as they inform our</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.910" end="00:39:42.410" style="s2">social institutions and they inform our</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:44.330" style="s2">individual everyday lives I think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.410" end="00:39:46.370" style="s2">if we utilize this metaphorical language</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.330" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">of saying oh you know the gods are alive</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.370" end="00:39:50.420" style="s2">and here are the behaviors that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:53.390" style="s2">having but that&#39;s a way of rendering</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.420" end="00:39:55.880" style="s2">this diffuse and very strange object</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.390" end="00:39:59.610" style="s2">very easily intelligible to us and if we</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.880" end="00:40:01.560" style="s2">can get past the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.610" end="00:40:02.850" style="s2">we benefit from using these terms not</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.560" end="00:40:03.990" style="s2">because they&#39;re literally true because</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.850" end="00:40:06.600" style="s2">that&#39;s not how we&#39;re using them we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.990" end="00:40:08.940" style="s2">using them as a metaphor to crack open</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.600" end="00:40:12.030" style="s2">something which is otherwise closed from</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.940" end="00:40:14.700" style="s2">us I think that&#39;s a very fruitful way to</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.030" end="00:40:16.080" style="s2">begin grasping things that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.700" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">fundamentally beyond us and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.080" end="00:40:21.000" style="s2">people have always been using this I</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:23.550" style="s2">think if you look at history hyper</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.000" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">objects are actually exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.550" end="00:40:28.530" style="s2">spiritual traditions have been looking</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:30.420" style="s2">at their spiritual god-like forces I</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.530" end="00:40:35.330" style="s2">mean one thing that comes clearly to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.420" end="00:40:37.590" style="s2">mind is Neoplatonism eyewear right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.330" end="00:40:39.390" style="s2">but that&#39;s gonna lead to a question but</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.590" end="00:40:41.220" style="s2">first let me you know you have that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.390" end="00:40:43.830" style="s2">have the relationship between furia and</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.220" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">fear gia in neoplatonism you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.830" end="00:40:50.190" style="s2">iamblichus say right that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:51.390" style="s2">world of the forms is basically like</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.190" end="00:40:53.670" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s like a world of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.390" end="00:40:56.850" style="s2">objects and we we have to relate to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.670" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">in in in the kind of fashion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.850" end="00:41:02.220" style="s2">talking about we have to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.560" end="00:41:05.420" style="s2">in terms of ritual enacted metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.220" end="00:41:08.130" style="s2">ritual interaction with the gods now</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.420" end="00:41:10.470" style="s2">there were arguments serious arguments</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.130" end="00:41:13.140" style="s2">in the ancient world about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.470" end="00:41:15.720" style="s2">understanding let&#39;s let&#39;s pick one God</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.140" end="00:41:17.010" style="s2">that understanding of Zeus and what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.720" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">might call the traditional understanding</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.010" end="00:41:24.840" style="s2">of Zeus what I mean by that is there</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:26.520" style="s2">seems to be to be a tension within the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.840" end="00:41:27.750" style="s2">proposal I think the proposal is good so</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.520" end="00:41:30.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to undermine the proposal</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.750" end="00:41:32.130" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to refine it right between a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.030" end="00:41:35.660" style="s2">theistic interpretation of a god and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.130" end="00:41:39.810" style="s2">non-theistic interpretation of a god hmm</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.660" end="00:41:42.140" style="s2">so that seems to be a relevant thing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.810" end="00:41:47.880" style="s2">then the other thing I would bring up is</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.140" end="00:41:50.250" style="s2">well how do we interact if like given</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.880" end="00:41:54.210" style="s2">the criteria that you&#39;ve you&#39;ve you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.250" end="00:41:56.550" style="s2">put out here which I think is right my I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.210" end="00:41:58.770" style="s2">want to I want to I want to say like you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.550" end="00:42:01.380" style="s2">know like urban sense of the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.770" end="00:42:03.180" style="s2">right image in the imaginal sense not is</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.380" end="00:42:04.680" style="s2">it just an inner picture right it has</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.180" end="00:42:10.530" style="s2">more to what you&#39;re talking about it if</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.680" end="00:42:11.880" style="s2">my if I have this image of the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.530" end="00:42:14.730" style="s2">object it</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.880" end="00:42:16.950" style="s2">should afford a kind of enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.730" end="00:42:19.589" style="s2">interaction with it because that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.950" end="00:42:23.130" style="s2">it should afford me being able to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.589" end="00:42:25.859" style="s2">into the continuity of contact interact</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.130" end="00:42:27.569" style="s2">with it in some viable way what would</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.859" end="00:42:32.089" style="s2">that look like what would that look like</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.569" end="00:42:33.809" style="s2">ya know that is a great question okay so</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.089" end="00:42:35.009" style="s2">prophecy I think if we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.809" end="00:42:37.950" style="s2">philosophy of prophecy we have some</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.009" end="00:42:41.400" style="s2">answers so Moses Maimonides view of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.950" end="00:42:42.450" style="s2">prophecy is that well he contrasts so</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.400" end="00:42:43.859" style="s2">he&#39;s got a book called the guide if</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.450" end="00:42:46.019" style="s2">they&#39;re perplexed which really</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.859" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">systematize is all of his philosophy he</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.019" end="00:42:50.579" style="s2">tries to sort of ground a Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:53.160" style="s2">theology with a lot of Aristotelian sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.579" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">of terms and he contrasts the view of</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.160" end="00:42:56.220" style="s2">philosophy or the view of prophecy that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:42:58.799" style="s2">philosophers have to the view of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.220" end="00:43:01.170" style="s2">prophecy that people have within a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.799" end="00:43:02.490" style="s2">Jewish context and so Plato is one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.170" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">these people as we mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.490" end="00:43:05.220" style="s2">he&#39;s like yeah so altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:07.230" style="s2">consciousness where you get these</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.220" end="00:43:08.970" style="s2">prophetic visions it&#39;s like a divine</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.230" end="00:43:11.069" style="s2">kind of madness where you get abstract</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.970" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">information on the gods and anybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.069" end="00:43:17.519" style="s2">could have that happen it&#39;s a gift when</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:21.089" style="s2">it happens mm-hmm now Maimonides makes</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.519" end="00:43:22.980" style="s2">very clear that what prophecy is doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.089" end="00:43:24.450" style="s2">is it&#39;s rendering things beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.980" end="00:43:25.589" style="s2">understanding into our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.450" end="00:43:27.990" style="s2">when there are things that are beyond</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.589" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">our capacity for rational intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.990" end="00:43:32.549" style="s2">understanding there is an overflow of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:34.710" style="s2">that which we can&#39;t understand into our</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.549" end="00:43:35.880" style="s2">imagination and the imagination is all</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.710" end="00:43:37.769" style="s2">of this sort of metaphorical cross</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.880" end="00:43:39.329" style="s2">networking in order to render</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.769" end="00:43:42.329" style="s2">intelligible to us that which was</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.329" end="00:43:45.809" style="s2">previously unintelligible so visions are</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.329" end="00:43:47.789" style="s2">a function of the imagination which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.809" end="00:43:50.759" style="s2">picking up on patterns in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.789" end="00:43:55.589" style="s2">are different than the patterns that can</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.759" end="00:43:58.079" style="s2">be had via logical literal discourse so</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.589" end="00:44:00.029" style="s2">for example if I see a person come to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.079" end="00:44:02.009" style="s2">you know if I&#39;m Isaiah in the Book of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.029" end="00:44:04.049" style="s2">Isaiah and a bunch of angels come to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.009" end="00:44:06.660" style="s2">and they give me a mission on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.049" end="00:44:08.759" style="s2">God well I could have thought all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.660" end="00:44:11.369" style="s2">those things on my you know but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.759" end="00:44:13.619" style="s2">firstly a much more enhanced sense like</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.369" end="00:44:15.329" style="s2">an imperative to this vision it wakes up</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.619" end="00:44:16.529" style="s2">your emotional energy and also</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.329" end="00:44:17.700" style="s2">interacting with the person is very</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.529" end="00:44:20.220" style="s2">different from interacting with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.700" end="00:44:21.809" style="s2">proposition so by rendering something</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.220" end="00:44:24.269" style="s2">intelligible via the attributes of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.809" end="00:44:25.560" style="s2">person you are rendering it with a set</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.269" end="00:44:27.300" style="s2">of inferential properties</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.560" end="00:44:32.130" style="s2">that differ from those of propositions</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.300" end="00:44:34.830" style="s2">so you&#39;re creating a enhanced ability to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.130" end="00:44:37.500" style="s2">reason and that reason about things in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.830" end="00:44:39.600" style="s2">sort of nonlinear fashion hmm now where</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.500" end="00:44:41.160" style="s2">my monarchy says his view differs from</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.600" end="00:44:42.540" style="s2">the prop are from the philosophers cuz</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.160" end="00:44:43.980" style="s2">all the things I just said are also</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.540" end="00:44:45.960" style="s2">accepted by the philosophers he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.980" end="00:44:48.450" style="s2">talking about Millions the playtest</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.960" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">etcetera even the Stoics were down with</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.450" end="00:44:51.330" style="s2">this they were like yeah God has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:52.740" style="s2">exist because how could we know things</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.330" end="00:44:56.910" style="s2">about the future and dreams like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.740" end="00:44:58.740" style="s2">obvious but there&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.910" end="00:45:01.410" style="s2">hyper object in Judaism that hyper</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.740" end="00:45:03.570" style="s2">object is Yahweh Yahweh is a particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.410" end="00:45:06.150" style="s2">hyper object that marries the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.570" end="00:45:09.240" style="s2">object of the Israelite people and pulls</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.150" end="00:45:11.220" style="s2">it into itself and when a Jewish prophet</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.240" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">is experiencing prophecy it&#39;s the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.220" end="00:45:16.620" style="s2">object of God interfacing with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:19.140" style="s2">imagination of the individual to provide</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.620" end="00:45:22.290" style="s2">revelations about what that hyper object</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.140" end="00:45:24.540" style="s2">wants it to do right yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.290" end="00:45:26.820" style="s2">that we actually can interact with hyper</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.540" end="00:45:28.680" style="s2">objects in this sort of way I think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.820" end="00:45:31.380" style="s2">we can pick up on social patterns on</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.680" end="00:45:32.910" style="s2">cosmic patterns and that we can make</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.380" end="00:45:35.070" style="s2">sense of them through dreams through</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.910" end="00:45:39.000" style="s2">visions you know through these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.070" end="00:45:41.880" style="s2">abstract altered state so you periences</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.000" end="00:45:48.110" style="s2">so let&#39;s go back to climate change your</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.880" end="00:45:53.820" style="s2">example then because there&#39;s a concern</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.110" end="00:45:56.250" style="s2">so I&#39;ll ask a question you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.820" end="00:45:58.020" style="s2">proposing that people have visions and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.250" end="00:46:00.090" style="s2">dreams as a way of competing with</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.020" end="00:46:02.370" style="s2">climate science for claims about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.090" end="00:46:04.830" style="s2">going on no no just for getting insights</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.370" end="00:46:06.300" style="s2">about how to act right so well I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.830" end="00:46:09.930" style="s2">that&#39;s important for people to hear</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.300" end="00:46:11.400" style="s2">right so you&#39;re not in fact your</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.930" end="00:46:13.380" style="s2">argument sort of commits you to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.400" end="00:46:15.260" style="s2">that you&#39;re not you&#39;re not proposing</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.380" end="00:46:17.970" style="s2">this as an alternative way of generating</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.260" end="00:46:20.430" style="s2">competing theories that compete with our</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.970" end="00:46:23.550" style="s2">best sort of scientific practices you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.430" end="00:46:25.950" style="s2">seeing you&#39;re proposing it as a way of I</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.550" end="00:46:26.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the word is here I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.950" end="00:46:29.210" style="s2">happy with this word but I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.820" end="00:46:31.500" style="s2">use it sort of concretizing</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.210" end="00:46:36.200" style="s2">ability to interact with hyper objects</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.500" end="00:46:36.200" style="s2">so that people are no longer sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.410" end="00:46:41.390" style="s2">a cognitive miasma with respect to it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.600" end="00:46:43.580" style="s2">yes yes yes it helps us to sort of cut</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.390" end="00:46:45.410" style="s2">through our bullshit to help us to see</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.580" end="00:46:48.170" style="s2">what is the most relevant way to act in</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.410" end="00:46:50.420" style="s2">regard to some sort of ambiguous large</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.170" end="00:46:53.990" style="s2">phenomena right right that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.420" end="00:46:56.600" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting so tie this back</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.990" end="00:46:58.190" style="s2">because I like it tie this back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.600" end="00:46:59.750" style="s2">altered states of consciousness because</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.190" end="00:47:01.430" style="s2">what I what I could hear you saying I</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.750" end="00:47:02.870" style="s2">mean is something like well you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.430" end="00:47:05.330" style="s2">what altered states of consciousness do</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.870" end="00:47:07.070" style="s2">they they open up the implicit learning</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.330" end="00:47:09.080" style="s2">machinery they open up the insight</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.070" end="00:47:15.890" style="s2">machinery they they bring in all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.080" end="00:47:18.770" style="s2">of of patterns that might be good clues</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.890" end="00:47:25.150" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the right word or traces or</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.770" end="00:47:28.010" style="s2">signs of how I could viably come into a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.150" end="00:47:29.720" style="s2">relationship with hyper objects is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.010" end="00:47:31.820" style="s2">the connection is that how I should be</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.720" end="00:47:33.230" style="s2">seeing this yes absolutely it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.820" end="00:47:34.250" style="s2">enhancing our implicit learning</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.230" end="00:47:37.790" style="s2">machinery I think that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.250" end="00:47:40.280" style="s2">correct and also of revealing that which</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.790" end="00:47:42.350" style="s2">is implicit within us the inside aspect</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.280" end="00:47:43.880" style="s2">of it yeah yeah and if we don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.350" end="00:47:46.210" style="s2">this is an option for us then we go</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.880" end="00:47:48.620" style="s2">blind to it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.210" end="00:47:50.510" style="s2">say more about that that was a really</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.620" end="00:47:52.130" style="s2">pregnant pause I wanted I want to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.510" end="00:47:57.470" style="s2">what was in the pregnant pause there</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.130" end="00:47:58.940" style="s2">okay okay so that which we see is always</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.470" end="00:48:00.560" style="s2">somewhat determined by that which we</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.940" end="00:48:03.560" style="s2">think we can act on this is where</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.560" end="00:48:05.810" style="s2">companions stuff about the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.560" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">comes in handy because with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.810" end="00:48:12.380" style="s2">metaphysical system of technic we see</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:14.660" style="s2">everything as some you know the tree the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.380" end="00:48:16.100" style="s2">forest isn&#39;t something that we just can</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.660" end="00:48:17.780" style="s2">enjoy it&#39;s not a living being on its own</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.100" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a set of resources waiting to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.780" end="00:48:23.300" style="s2">extracted into some other thing this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">a high to garyun idea yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.300" end="00:48:27.410" style="s2">Technic drives us to see the world in</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:30.910" style="s2">terms of things that we can pick apart</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.410" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">and manipulate but that view also</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.910" end="00:48:34.490" style="s2">prioritizes literal language and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:37.460" style="s2">does away with the sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.490" end="00:48:40.520" style="s2">wishy-washy imagination but if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.460" end="00:48:44.180" style="s2">recognize that because of our epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.520" end="00:48:48.770" style="s2">limits we have to know things at least</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.180" end="00:48:50.250" style="s2">at first in dreamlike phenomena then</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.770" end="00:48:52.140" style="s2">that opens us up to the possum</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.250" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">that when we have dreams when we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.140" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">visions when we go into a deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:56.940" style="s2">psychological state or a deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:58.560" style="s2">psychedelic state that the psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.940" end="00:49:00.750" style="s2">aren&#39;t only revealing us information</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.560" end="00:49:03.120" style="s2">about our personal psyche but that they</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.750" end="00:49:05.490" style="s2">are picking up on patterns at large in</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.120" end="00:49:07.470" style="s2">our communities that have been ingrained</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.490" end="00:49:09.480" style="s2">in our implicit learning machinery then</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.470" end="00:49:11.220" style="s2">we can take those visions more seriously</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.480" end="00:49:13.350" style="s2">and we can see them for what they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.220" end="00:49:15.780" style="s2">because the current model of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.350" end="00:49:17.690" style="s2">psychedelics which is using them in</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.780" end="00:49:21.390" style="s2">psycho psycho psychedelic psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.690" end="00:49:23.490" style="s2">it does sort of overly individualize the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.390" end="00:49:24.750" style="s2">person so I think that it was a number</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.490" end="00:49:26.190" style="s2">of things we have to reformulate when</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.750" end="00:49:27.630" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about how to effectively</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.190" end="00:49:30.270" style="s2">integrate altered states into our</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.630" end="00:49:31.560" style="s2">communities and this over mining</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.270" end="00:49:33.450" style="s2">undermining problem that I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.560" end="00:49:35.130" style="s2">isn&#39;t happening just for objects it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.450" end="00:49:36.930" style="s2">also happening for people but we</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.130" end="00:49:38.700" style="s2">undermine ourselves by thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.930" end="00:49:40.260" style="s2">were individuals and we over mine</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.700" end="00:49:42.270" style="s2">ourselves that&#39;s by thinking that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.260" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">only a group but the middle ground</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.270" end="00:49:46.110" style="s2">between that is that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:48.690" style="s2">ourselves as a member of a community and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.110" end="00:49:52.650" style="s2">as a member of a community each of us</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.690" end="00:49:54.990" style="s2">has access to different experiences</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.650" end="00:49:56.790" style="s2">different environments where in our</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.990" end="00:49:58.980" style="s2">implicit learning has sort of picked up</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.790" end="00:50:02.220" style="s2">on the greater whole in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.980" end="00:50:04.320" style="s2">situated and then we can take seriously</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.220" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">people&#39;s dreamlike revelations we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.320" end="00:50:08.070" style="s2">engage in dialogue about them if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:09.780" style="s2">don&#39;t fixate on the content too much and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.070" end="00:50:11.580" style="s2">say oh the content is literally real and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.780" end="00:50:13.320" style="s2">if we don&#39;t overly individualize the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.580" end="00:50:15.870" style="s2">content by saying oh this is only about</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.320" end="00:50:17.880" style="s2">your personal psyche then we can see</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.870" end="00:50:20.490" style="s2">that other option for action where these</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.880" end="00:50:22.290" style="s2">are revelations about implicit patterns</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.490" end="00:50:26.460" style="s2">that we&#39;re picking up on so this seems</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.290" end="00:50:27.780" style="s2">to me to be deeply convergent and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.460" end="00:50:30.180" style="s2">perhaps it would be strengthened by</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.780" end="00:50:32.490" style="s2">connections to like you know again a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.180" end="00:50:33.660" style="s2">core bands idea of the imaginal or what</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.490" end="00:50:36.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve argued for in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.660" end="00:50:39.510" style="s2">transgender is trying to get us away</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.990" end="00:50:41.640" style="s2">from the exhaustive categorization of</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.510" end="00:50:43.860" style="s2">things as either subjective which is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.640" end="00:50:46.980" style="s2">the purely psychological interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.860" end="00:50:48.900" style="s2">of the content of the altered state of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.980" end="00:50:53.010" style="s2">consciousness or purely objective well</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.900" end="00:50:55.740" style="s2">it&#39;s just literally true and I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.010" end="00:50:58.890" style="s2">that direction lies in both directions</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.740" end="00:51:00.930" style="s2">lies a propensity for a kind of madness</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.890" end="00:51:03.690" style="s2">the first can lead you down sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.930" end="00:51:07.500" style="s2">narcissistic hole and the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.690" end="00:51:11.700" style="s2">can lead you into well a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.500" end="00:51:16.200" style="s2">delusional state so we keep wrapping</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.700" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">around that right because every time so</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.200" end="00:51:21.869" style="s2">you see what I see happening and then I</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">do not mean this as a criticism this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.869" end="00:51:26.670" style="s2">an observation but I see happening is we</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:29.700" style="s2">we certainly confront a problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.670" end="00:51:32.369" style="s2">we pursue how the things we need to open</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.700" end="00:51:34.050" style="s2">things up but then we need to also</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.369" end="00:51:36.210" style="s2">always counterbalance it with yes but</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.050" end="00:51:38.520" style="s2">how do we constrain it so it doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.210" end="00:51:41.880" style="s2">in all of these ways we introduced at</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.520" end="00:51:45.660" style="s2">the very beginning there right but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.880" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">know setting up the right context it</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.660" end="00:51:52.589" style="s2">sounds to me like in addition and I know</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:53.970" style="s2">I believe you&#39;ve already agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.589" end="00:51:56.970" style="s2">set but I just want to get it out there</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.970" end="00:51:59.400" style="s2">so we can talk about it and involve our</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.970" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">viewers in the like in inter</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.400" end="00:52:05.490" style="s2">participation all right</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:06.900" style="s2">in addition to like all of these you</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.490" end="00:52:11.640" style="s2">know revising the metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.900" end="00:52:13.349" style="s2">getting sort of individual sets of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.640" end="00:52:17.280" style="s2">practices there&#39;s a way in which we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.349" end="00:52:19.619" style="s2">to build a lot of multi scale Euler and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:22.920" style="s2">mutually affording mechanisms of self</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.619" end="00:52:26.520" style="s2">correction yes yes I think one of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.920" end="00:52:28.530" style="s2">is by developing communities where we</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.520" end="00:52:30.300" style="s2">have very clear roles right not</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.530" end="00:52:32.099" style="s2">everybody has to be the prophetic mystic</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.300" end="00:52:35.450" style="s2">right that would definitely result in</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.099" end="00:52:38.790" style="s2">that this yes and so for example um</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.450" end="00:52:40.710" style="s2">Augustine in his confessions he mentions</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.790" end="00:52:42.329" style="s2">multiple times that his mother has</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.710" end="00:52:44.460" style="s2">dreams which seemed to be in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.329" end="00:52:46.230" style="s2">God they&#39;re like hidden insights which</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.460" end="00:52:48.089" style="s2">seem to be in touch with a greater good</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.230" end="00:52:49.650" style="s2">so I think that you know we can admit</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.089" end="00:52:50.700" style="s2">that everybody has these things like you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.650" end="00:52:52.230" style="s2">know your dreams they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.700" end="00:52:54.170" style="s2">picking up on something if you interpret</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.230" end="00:52:56.460" style="s2">them you&#39;ll get some genuine information</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.170" end="00:52:58.530" style="s2">but then there&#39;s you know there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.460" end="00:53:00.630" style="s2">but the Christians would say that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.530" end="00:53:02.490" style="s2">know prophecy has basically ended right</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.630" end="00:53:03.960" style="s2">which is coming from the Jewish context</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.490" end="00:53:05.099" style="s2">after a while they&#39;re like okay this</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.960" end="00:53:06.329" style="s2">altered state of consciousness thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.099" end="00:53:07.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit too much you know we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.329" end="00:53:09.390" style="s2">like a lot of prophets we&#39;ve had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.500" end="00:53:11.490" style="s2">of social change as a result of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.390" end="00:53:16.170" style="s2">visionary experiences but like no more</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.490" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">that&#39;s it so historically</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.170" end="00:53:22.590" style="s2">the tendency has been to constraining</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:24.570" style="s2">the access that people have to prophetic</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.590" end="00:53:27.120" style="s2">revelation and to only accepting the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.570" end="00:53:28.830" style="s2">most minimal versions of them but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.120" end="00:53:32.220" style="s2">think that&#39;s there is the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.830" end="00:53:34.350" style="s2">for a new social role where we do have</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.220" end="00:53:36.660" style="s2">people who are sort of mystical prophets</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.350" end="00:53:38.220" style="s2">and we trust their judgments more than</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.660" end="00:53:40.020" style="s2">others we have an institution that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.220" end="00:53:42.180" style="s2">trains these people which helps them to</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.020" end="00:53:44.220" style="s2">constrain their imagination but we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.180" end="00:53:47.250" style="s2">to look seriously at the imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.220" end="00:53:49.200" style="s2">its abilities for producing effective</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.250" end="00:53:50.700" style="s2">information and so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.200" end="00:53:53.010" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to help is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.700" end="00:53:55.020" style="s2">if we recontextualize what religions</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.010" end="00:53:57.570" style="s2">have been trying to do as art I think it</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.020" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">becomes a lot more easy the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.570" end="00:54:00.450" style="s2">understand art now is very different</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:02.460" style="s2">from how art has been stood of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.450" end="00:54:04.020" style="s2">understood a thousand years ago right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.460" end="00:54:06.060" style="s2">people who were going through the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.020" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">religious revolutions of the axial age</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.060" end="00:54:09.360" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have the understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:12.510" style="s2">art that we do and religion and art was</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.360" end="00:54:15.270" style="s2">always very closely interwoven mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.510" end="00:54:16.590" style="s2">now that&#39;s caused a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.270" end="00:54:19.380" style="s2">where you know some people are like well</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.590" end="00:54:22.170" style="s2">okay no art at all or if it&#39;s art it</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.380" end="00:54:23.970" style="s2">should only be in the service of God but</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.170" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">I think that if we look at artistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.970" end="00:54:28.680" style="s2">expression if we look at the expressive</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:31.950" style="s2">arts you know performance visual art</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.680" end="00:54:34.980" style="s2">music even as a way in which people can</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.950" end="00:54:37.860" style="s2">latch on to hyper objects which give us</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.980" end="00:54:39.720" style="s2">an impression of our imminent future if</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.860" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">we recontextualize it out of an overly</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.720" end="00:54:44.100" style="s2">religious context and into an artistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:47.310" style="s2">context that the problem becomes much</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.100" end="00:54:49.230" style="s2">more tractable mmm that&#39;s interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.310" end="00:54:52.020" style="s2">what I mean that brings me back to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.230" end="00:54:54.510" style="s2">point so again where I mentioned how</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.020" end="00:54:56.790" style="s2">poetry and philosophy were were in July</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.510" end="00:54:59.010" style="s2">together so is that also going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.790" end="00:55:00.870" style="s2">require a reformulation of our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.010" end="00:55:03.450" style="s2">notion of art because we&#39;ve tended to</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.870" end="00:55:04.710" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve we tend to have an overly</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.450" end="00:55:06.360" style="s2">romantic and I mean that in</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.710" end="00:55:08.810" style="s2">philosophical sense interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.360" end="00:55:12.060" style="s2">art and we sort of divorced art from</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.810" end="00:55:15.030" style="s2">philosophy in and the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.060" end="00:55:17.610" style="s2">wisdom so the prototypical artist is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.030" end="00:55:19.530" style="s2">saw is the prototype for an artist is</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.610" end="00:55:21.420" style="s2">not someone seeking wisdom in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.530" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">prototype for artist is often you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.420" end="00:55:27.000" style="s2">the romantic in early conflicted</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:29.500" style="s2">individual who is ultimately on a course</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.000" end="00:55:31.420" style="s2">of self-destruction but never the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.500" end="00:55:34.360" style="s2">last sacrifices if you know the van Gogh</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.420" end="00:55:35.590" style="s2">model uh the artist right I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.360" end="00:55:37.240" style="s2">also another model of the artist which</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.590" end="00:55:38.710" style="s2">is just like oh I&#39;m just like a really</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.240" end="00:55:39.940" style="s2">flat II person with a lot of creative</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.710" end="00:55:44.320" style="s2">energy and I just create shit I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.940" end="00:55:46.450" style="s2">really know what it means and right both</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.320" end="00:55:48.790" style="s2">of those those are both both of those</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.450" end="00:55:51.220" style="s2">are sort of you know within the pantheon</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.790" end="00:55:53.050" style="s2">of the Romantic understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.220" end="00:55:54.790" style="s2">artist it sounds to me like you are</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.050" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">proposing something other than that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.790" end="00:56:00.550" style="s2">that&#39;s it so what is it well I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:01.750" style="s2">that&#39;s you know if we understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.550" end="00:56:03.370" style="s2">ourselves not as individuals but as</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.750" end="00:56:05.560" style="s2">members of a community then we can look</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.370" end="00:56:07.510" style="s2">in terms of how do we form communities</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.560" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">such that we can make the most of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.510" end="00:56:10.750" style="s2">potential of the artists I see artists</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:12.280" style="s2">as people who have a lot of creative</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.750" end="00:56:14.410" style="s2">potential but not really a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.280" end="00:56:16.420" style="s2">top-down processing to like constrain</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.410" end="00:56:18.100" style="s2">and direct that potential some people</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.420" end="00:56:20.710" style="s2">are blessed with that ability but not</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.100" end="00:56:24.460" style="s2">everybody and I do think that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.710" end="00:56:26.200" style="s2">culture we live in does provide it makes</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.460" end="00:56:28.780" style="s2">it easier for people to go about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.200" end="00:56:30.550" style="s2">rapid content generation without</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.780" end="00:56:32.140" style="s2">consideration kind of thing and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.550" end="00:56:33.190" style="s2">obviously going to be information in</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.140" end="00:56:35.800" style="s2">there that&#39;s really important and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.190" end="00:56:37.540" style="s2">interesting but that need for artists to</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.800" end="00:56:38.590" style="s2">always produce to always get the next</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.540" end="00:56:40.300" style="s2">thing out so that they can always be</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.590" end="00:56:43.360" style="s2">making sales and sustain their lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.300" end="00:56:45.880" style="s2">etc I think that that is negative for</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.360" end="00:56:47.770" style="s2">artists I think that it creates an</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.880" end="00:56:49.720" style="s2">impetus for them which doesn&#39;t give them</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.770" end="00:56:52.410" style="s2">the time to actually sit down and sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.720" end="00:56:55.560" style="s2">of take a more slow and mindful approach</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.410" end="00:56:58.210" style="s2">now this is actually isn&#39;t there also</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.560" end="00:57:00.370" style="s2">don&#39;t let me just rally you but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.210" end="00:57:03.460" style="s2">we also have a mythology of sort of art</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.370" end="00:57:06.820" style="s2">being very individualistic and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.460" end="00:57:08.560" style="s2">subjective and expressive yes yeah we do</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.820" end="00:57:11.500" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s transforming a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.560" end="00:57:13.090" style="s2">bit so I put some I gave you some</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.500" end="00:57:13.450" style="s2">resources to put in the description of</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.090" end="00:57:15.910" style="s2">this video</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.450" end="00:57:18.790" style="s2">look art collectives that I think are</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.910" end="00:57:20.110" style="s2">good examples of how to go forward so</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.790" end="00:57:23.380" style="s2">this is art collective from the UK</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.110" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">called kimitaka and I watched a talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.380" end="00:57:29.620" style="s2">from the founders the founder gave a</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:31.870" style="s2">talk at a conference called what was it</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.620" end="00:57:34.690" style="s2">breaking convention and her name is</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.870" end="00:57:35.920" style="s2">Maria she was talking about how not</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.690" end="00:57:37.450" style="s2">everybody is ready to sit down and do</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.920" end="00:57:39.460" style="s2">the work of meditation so how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.450" end="00:57:41.350" style="s2">people to engage in the transformative</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.460" end="00:57:42.589" style="s2">experiences that will reorient their</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.350" end="00:57:44.599" style="s2">perspectives tour</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.589" end="00:57:46.309" style="s2">something that&#39;s better for us well can</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.599" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">use what we know from ritual and</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.309" end="00:57:50.779" style="s2">shamanism to create performance art</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:52.519" style="s2">pieces that give people these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.779" end="00:57:53.809" style="s2">transformative insights because not</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.519" end="00:57:55.190" style="s2">everyone&#39;s willing to sit down and do</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.809" end="00:57:56.479" style="s2">the work of transformation a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.190" end="00:57:57.950" style="s2">people are very afraid of changing the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.479" end="00:58:00.200" style="s2">world view the very attached to the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.950" end="00:58:02.059" style="s2">they see things but everyone loves to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.200" end="00:58:03.440" style="s2">entertained so it&#39;s really easy to like</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.059" end="00:58:07.130" style="s2">you know sell tickets get people in an</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.440" end="00:58:10.160" style="s2">event for a performance art piece but if</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.130" end="00:58:12.109" style="s2">the artists are keeping in mind wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:13.729" style="s2">these higher ideals of connecting people</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.109" end="00:58:15.019" style="s2">with hyper objects of these you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.729" end="00:58:16.729" style="s2">cultural entities that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.019" end="00:58:19.719" style="s2">situated within but perhaps can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.729" end="00:58:21.650" style="s2">see that&#39;s a great way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.719" end="00:58:25.849" style="s2">recontextualizing the artistic process I</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.650" end="00:58:27.109" style="s2">think see I left a link for Maria&#39;s art</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.849" end="00:58:27.469" style="s2">collective I think that&#39;s a great way to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.109" end="00:58:32.029" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.469" end="00:58:34.190" style="s2">now there&#39;s also so this religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.029" end="00:58:36.499" style="s2">not a religion thing all right right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.190" end="00:58:37.460" style="s2">I think that this is this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.499" end="00:58:39.529" style="s2">thing this is like something that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.460" end="00:58:42.979" style="s2">really want to work on next year I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.529" end="00:58:44.749" style="s2">that the the religious revolution that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.979" end="00:58:47.420" style="s2">we need is going to be also an art</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.749" end="00:58:49.819" style="s2">revolution and so I think that we need</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.420" end="00:58:52.309" style="s2">people who can act as artistic directors</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.819" end="00:58:55.130" style="s2">who can create an institution where they</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.309" end="00:58:57.410" style="s2">network with artists to create a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.130" end="00:58:59.450" style="s2">of insightful art art that encodes</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.410" end="00:58:59.900" style="s2">information that our insights waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.450" end="00:59:01.400" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.900" end="00:59:03.859" style="s2">because that&#39;s exactly what religious</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.400" end="00:59:05.059" style="s2">art is even especially when you get into</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.859" end="00:59:06.200" style="s2">the more occult domains of things</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.059" end="00:59:08.599" style="s2">everything&#39;s encoded in these</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.200" end="00:59:10.130" style="s2">interesting symbols now I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.599" end="00:59:11.960" style="s2">can do that in an open and ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.130" end="00:59:14.390" style="s2">fashion such that we can maintain</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.960" end="00:59:16.849" style="s2">contact between these symbols and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.390" end="00:59:20.170" style="s2">ever-changing hyper objects of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.849" end="00:59:23.660" style="s2">cosmos and culture so I think that by</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.170" end="00:59:25.099" style="s2">understanding religion as art and by</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.660" end="00:59:27.589" style="s2">creating a religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.099" end="00:59:30.319" style="s2">religion but through more of an art</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.589" end="00:59:31.849" style="s2">collective model networking a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.319" end="00:59:35.029" style="s2">artists with creative potential with</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.849" end="00:59:38.390" style="s2">people who can play the role of artistic</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.029" end="00:59:39.499" style="s2">director to constrain and hone the sorts</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.390" end="00:59:41.329" style="s2">of things that these artists are</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.499" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">channeling I think that&#39;s a great way</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.329" end="00:59:48.190" style="s2">forward so that&#39;s great thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:51.200" style="s2">explaining that I like that connection</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.190" end="00:59:55.320" style="s2">and one of course why are you mean also</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.200" end="00:59:56.790" style="s2">a lot of performative art - right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.320" end="00:59:59.430" style="s2">because you know what&#39;s also happening</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.790" end="01:00:00.840" style="s2">all around the world is people might not</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.430" end="01:00:05.490" style="s2">see what they&#39;re doing is art I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.840" end="01:00:07.590" style="s2">thinking of you know you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.490" end="01:00:09.360" style="s2">live-action role-playing games that</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.590" end="01:00:12.180" style="s2">people engage in like the Jeep forming</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.360" end="01:00:14.370" style="s2">in Scandinavia or the resurgence of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.180" end="01:00:16.460" style="s2">improv as a way people are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.370" end="01:00:19.050" style="s2">respond to the meeting crisis where</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.460" end="01:00:21.030" style="s2">right improv people might see what</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.050" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is art but it overlaps a</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.030" end="01:00:25.050" style="s2">lot with the Jeep form that people are</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:27.450" style="s2">performing they and they might not see</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.050" end="01:00:29.430" style="s2">it as art but it sounds to me like those</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.450" end="01:00:31.260" style="s2">things would clearly fall under what</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.430" end="01:00:33.180" style="s2">you&#39;re calling art in fact they might be</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.260" end="01:00:37.400" style="s2">even more relevant than just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.180" end="01:00:40.740" style="s2">static objects because they tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.400" end="01:00:44.460" style="s2">dynamical systems themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.740" end="01:00:47.190" style="s2">therefore they&#39;re best for giving us a</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.460" end="01:00:48.840" style="s2">participatory knowledge of complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.190" end="01:00:50.640" style="s2">dynamical systems both in our culture</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.840" end="01:00:51.570" style="s2">and our environment yeah yeah I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.640" end="01:00:52.560" style="s2">glad you brought up the role play</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.570" end="01:00:54.270" style="s2">connection because I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.560" end="01:00:55.950" style="s2">super important and with the LARPing</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.270" end="01:00:57.360" style="s2">stuff the live-action roleplay often</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.950" end="01:00:58.710" style="s2">people are like going away for a weekend</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.360" end="01:00:59.670" style="s2">and they&#39;re just trying to escape their</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.710" end="01:01:02.730" style="s2">everyday world and they don&#39;t bring</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.670" end="01:01:03.690" style="s2">anything back yes but you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.730" end="01:01:05.490" style="s2">the notion that you talk about about</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.690" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">serious play of religion as a space for</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.490" end="01:01:10.500" style="s2">serious play is something that is going</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:12.030" style="s2">to be a foundational element of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.500" end="01:01:16.050" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion but is</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.030" end="01:01:17.070" style="s2">also an art collective and so what I see</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.050" end="01:01:18.390" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.070" end="01:01:20.010" style="s2">looking like is something like a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.390" end="01:01:21.630" style="s2">marriage between Disney World and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.010" end="01:01:23.160" style="s2">University except it cares more about</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.630" end="01:01:28.650" style="s2">your well-being than it cares about your</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.160" end="01:01:32.580" style="s2">capital that&#39;s great that&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.650" end="01:01:35.130" style="s2">poster that&#39;s fantastic I like so so</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.580" end="01:01:37.940" style="s2">again trying to keep a line of</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.130" end="01:01:40.410" style="s2">continuity going through it so</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.940" end="01:01:42.420" style="s2">psychedelics would be sort of fitting</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.410" end="01:01:44.310" style="s2">into you know they talk about set and</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.420" end="01:01:46.920" style="s2">setting but we&#39;re talking about I talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.310" end="01:01:50.360" style="s2">about you know you know in active in</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.920" end="01:01:53.310" style="s2">framing and so the idea is this artistic</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.360" end="01:01:56.340" style="s2">community and these this new ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.310" end="01:01:59.780" style="s2">artistic practices would be without with</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.340" end="01:02:02.970" style="s2">within which we would put right</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.780" end="01:02:06.920" style="s2">psychedelics and other altered states of</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.970" end="01:02:08.250" style="s2">consciousness as a way of affording a</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.920" end="01:02:11.700" style="s2">constrained</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.250" end="01:02:13.800" style="s2">and viable serious play did I put it all</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.700" end="01:02:14.820" style="s2">together well absolutely I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.800" end="01:02:17.370" style="s2">exactly correct</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.820" end="01:02:18.810" style="s2">now that also must be contextualized</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.370" end="01:02:21.210" style="s2">with a particular problem so I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.810" end="01:02:23.190" style="s2">that psychedelics they open us up they</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.210" end="01:02:25.830" style="s2">bring us into touch with certain things</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.190" end="01:02:27.420" style="s2">in our implicit learning systems that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.830" end="01:02:29.880" style="s2">haven&#39;t been quite aware of and that</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.420" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">they have the capacity to connect us to</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.880" end="01:02:36.690" style="s2">various socio-cultural hyper objects</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:38.520" style="s2">they also can afford you know the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.690" end="01:02:40.350" style="s2">possibility of a dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.520" end="01:02:43.620" style="s2">self-organization that we can&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.350" end="01:02:45.420" style="s2">get to on our own right the idea you</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.620" end="01:02:47.610" style="s2">know who you know that they introduce a</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.420" end="01:02:49.350" style="s2">kind of noise into the neural net one</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.610" end="01:02:51.240" style="s2">allow it to explore a state space that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.350" end="01:02:52.260" style="s2">it normally can&#39;t get into yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.240" end="01:02:53.700" style="s2">I think that&#39;s how it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.260" end="01:02:56.250" style="s2">providing revelations about implicit</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.700" end="01:02:56.610" style="s2">learning oh I see I see I see okay now I</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.250" end="01:03:00.900" style="s2">get it</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.610" end="01:03:02.790" style="s2">okay keep going then yes okay so with</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.900" end="01:03:04.440" style="s2">the overtly individualized model of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.790" end="01:03:05.880" style="s2">psychedelics like Ana therapy of saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.440" end="01:03:07.500" style="s2">here let&#39;s get you in let&#39;s solve your</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.880" end="01:03:08.940" style="s2">particular problems and like let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.500" end="01:03:10.020" style="s2">it such that you can go back into your</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.940" end="01:03:12.060" style="s2">community and nothing about that</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.020" end="01:03:13.470" style="s2">community changes there have been some</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.060" end="01:03:15.120" style="s2">papers come out which show actually that</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.470" end="01:03:16.290" style="s2">if people aren&#39;t receptive to the sorts</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.120" end="01:03:17.610" style="s2">of insights that people haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.290" end="01:03:19.950" style="s2">psychedelic therapy when they go back</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.610" end="01:03:23.010" style="s2">home that the efficacy of that treatment</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.950" end="01:03:25.050" style="s2">is blunted by the context they&#39;re in but</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.010" end="01:03:27.300" style="s2">but this is all I mean not to trivialize</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.050" end="01:03:29.640" style="s2">but actually just reinforce your point</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.300" end="01:03:31.560" style="s2">it has always been the idea right of</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.640" end="01:03:32.760" style="s2">therapy that you have the triad</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.560" end="01:03:34.380" style="s2">all right you can have you know the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.760" end="01:03:36.030" style="s2">formal logical intervention and you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.380" end="01:03:37.290" style="s2">the therapeutic intervention but you</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.030" end="01:03:38.880" style="s2">also have to have the social</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.290" end="01:03:41.460" style="s2">intervention right a person won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.880" end="01:03:42.870" style="s2">actually you know get the full recovery</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.460" end="01:03:43.830" style="s2">that you&#39;re after and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.870" end="01:03:45.750" style="s2">accounts for enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.830" end="01:03:47.310" style="s2">enlightenment and wisdom as well because</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.750" end="01:03:50.220" style="s2">you can only be as enlightened as your</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.310" end="01:03:51.960" style="s2">community let&#39;s see uh yes which is why</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.220" end="01:03:53.400" style="s2">Plato thought you know if we have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.960" end="01:03:56.040" style="s2">philosopher Kings show up what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.400" end="01:03:58.050" style="s2">happen he&#39;s gonna be crucified he</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.040" end="01:03:59.880" style="s2">literally says that which was like very</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.050" end="01:04:03.360" style="s2">strange and something that be Christian</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.880" end="01:04:06.930" style="s2">theologians later gravitate like that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.360" end="01:04:08.910" style="s2">mean there&#39;s an insight there you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.930" end="01:04:11.130" style="s2">and no prophet is honored in his own</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.910" end="01:04:16.220" style="s2">home to actually speak the words of</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.130" end="01:04:16.220" style="s2">Jesus of Nazareth so</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.560" end="01:04:18.930" style="s2">there&#39;s just one thing that I want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.880" end="01:04:22.620" style="s2">get out which I&#39;ve been sort of building</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.930" end="01:04:24.270" style="s2">up to okay sorry we&#39;ll do that I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.620" end="01:04:31.130" style="s2">mark my question and bring it back later</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.270" end="01:04:34.190" style="s2">cool okay so if we don&#39;t mindfully</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.130" end="01:04:36.300" style="s2">connect the psychedelic experience to</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.190" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">particular hyper objects particular</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.300" end="01:04:40.080" style="s2">processes which are in the best interest</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:42.300" style="s2">of the individual and our communities at</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.080" end="01:04:43.560" style="s2">large then the insights in the openness</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.300" end="01:04:45.000" style="s2">that we get from these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.560" end="01:04:47.370" style="s2">experiences will just latch on to</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.000" end="01:04:49.170" style="s2">whatever is at hand right now we are</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.370" end="01:04:51.690" style="s2">situated within the hyper object of</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.170" end="01:04:54.240" style="s2">capitalism and that has very real</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.690" end="01:04:56.190" style="s2">effects on us right and so we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.240" end="01:04:58.020" style="s2">very careful because we are beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.190" end="01:05:00.570" style="s2">get into a stage where psychedelics are</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.020" end="01:05:02.400" style="s2">being commercialized there are now</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.570" end="01:05:03.600" style="s2">psychedelics and investment conferences</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.400" end="01:05:05.640" style="s2">opening up there was one in Toronto</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.600" end="01:05:08.460" style="s2">recently there was one in New York a few</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.640" end="01:05:09.930" style="s2">months ago and especially the people who</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.460" end="01:05:11.310" style="s2">have been making money off of cannabis</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.930" end="01:05:12.660" style="s2">now that that&#39;s legal they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.310" end="01:05:15.930" style="s2">that the same thing is gonna happen with</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.660" end="01:05:17.490" style="s2">psychedelics and so capitalist motives</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.930" end="01:05:21.330" style="s2">are going to be parasitizing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.490" end="01:05:22.770" style="s2">potential of psychedelics so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.330" end="01:05:24.090" style="s2">story which i would recommend everyone</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.770" end="01:05:26.280" style="s2">who&#39;s concerned about this problem to</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.090" end="01:05:28.380" style="s2">read it&#39;s called we will call it pala</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.280" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">I give you a link to put in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.380" end="01:05:31.770" style="s2">description so it&#39;ll be there for those</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:34.560" style="s2">who want to look at it but it describes</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.770" end="01:05:36.870" style="s2">the story of a woman who has this</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.560" end="01:05:38.250" style="s2">insightful LSD experience she&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.870" end="01:05:40.680" style="s2">I want to bring like love and joy to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.250" end="01:05:42.810" style="s2">everybody so I&#39;m gonna open this you</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.680" end="01:05:45.630" style="s2">know therapeutic space where people can</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.810" end="01:05:47.640" style="s2">undergo guided psychedelic sessions and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.630" end="01:05:48.870" style="s2">you know for a few years it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.640" end="01:05:50.430" style="s2">what she wants people are having these</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.870" end="01:05:53.580" style="s2">meaningful transformative experiences</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.430" end="01:05:54.930" style="s2">but she requires - in order to keep his</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.580" end="01:05:57.030" style="s2">business going she has to take on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.930" end="01:05:58.470" style="s2">typical capitalist business model or she</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.030" end="01:05:59.700" style="s2">has to get investors the investors</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.470" end="01:06:02.370" style="s2">become part of the board of directors</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.700" end="01:06:04.590" style="s2">they make a lot of the decisions and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.370" end="01:06:07.050" style="s2">this story tells the process of what</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.590" end="01:06:09.480" style="s2">happens as the market fragments and as</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.050" end="01:06:11.640" style="s2">more competition emerges in the market</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.480" end="01:06:14.820" style="s2">surrounding psychedelic therapy and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.640" end="01:06:16.950" style="s2">we have for example as she becomes less</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.820" end="01:06:18.780" style="s2">competitive than these other psychedelic</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.950" end="01:06:21.780" style="s2">therapy groups she has two new things</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.780" end="01:06:23.310" style="s2">like put capital at the front because</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.780" end="01:06:24.960" style="s2">even though the investors are first</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.310" end="01:06:26.610" style="s2">motivated because they have people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.960" end="01:06:28.710" style="s2">could be helped by psychedelics what</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.610" end="01:06:29.799" style="s2">they actually care about our returns on</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.710" end="01:06:31.599" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.799" end="01:06:33.369" style="s2">money is put at the center that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.599" end="01:06:35.589" style="s2">valued and so that distorts people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.369" end="01:06:37.719" style="s2">behavior and so her company becomes</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.589" end="01:06:39.339" style="s2">something like a hyper object it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.719" end="01:06:41.499" style="s2">something that has a life of its own and</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.339" end="01:06:43.239" style="s2">a personality of its own situated within</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.499" end="01:06:46.150" style="s2">the larger hyper object of capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.239" end="01:06:47.380" style="s2">and so she ends up getting fired from</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.150" end="01:06:49.509" style="s2">the board of directors and it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.380" end="01:06:51.640" style="s2">something other than her because she</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.509" end="01:06:53.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to put capital before her</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.640" end="01:06:54.309" style="s2">patients and the board of directors is</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.170" end="01:06:55.449" style="s2">like well sorry you know that&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.309" end="01:06:56.939" style="s2">gonna work for us so now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.449" end="01:06:59.609" style="s2">sell this off to a big pharma company</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.939" end="01:07:01.989" style="s2">and some of the things that they use are</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.609" end="01:07:03.759" style="s2">like it&#39;s really well laid out this</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.989" end="01:07:05.920" style="s2">story and they use a lot of illustration</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.759" end="01:07:09.400" style="s2">which is really good so for example as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.920" end="01:07:11.019" style="s2">means of increasing their earnings they</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.400" end="01:07:12.819" style="s2">provide discounts to people who have</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.019" end="01:07:14.709" style="s2">just come out of a psychedelic therapy</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.819" end="01:07:16.569" style="s2">session for signing up right away which</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.709" end="01:07:18.849" style="s2">is extremely unethical because you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:07:23.890" end="01:07:26.709" style="s2">having people to integration sessions</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.809" end="01:07:28.479" style="s2">that give you an app that does</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.709" end="01:07:30.309" style="s2">integration for you and then the app</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.479" end="01:07:33.130" style="s2">collects information about you and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.309" end="01:07:35.529" style="s2">based on its inferences it gives you</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.130" end="01:07:38.229" style="s2">notifications at certain important times</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.529" end="01:07:39.369" style="s2">such as six months ago you said that</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.229" end="01:07:42.269" style="s2">this experience changed your life</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.369" end="01:07:45.339" style="s2">imagine what another one could do I see</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.269" end="01:07:47.859" style="s2">there&#39;s this very real danger that these</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.339" end="01:07:49.539" style="s2">capitalist motives which are very deeply</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.859" end="01:07:52.479" style="s2">ingrained into our social structures</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.539" end="01:07:55.719" style="s2">will parasitize and take over the</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.479" end="01:07:58.239" style="s2">potential that psychedelics have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.719" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">offer us and so we might end up in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.239" end="01:08:03.160" style="s2">world where it&#39;s like brave new world</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:04.989" style="s2">right where people when they&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.160" end="01:08:06.369" style="s2">too satisfied take a psychedelic drug</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.989" end="01:08:09.069" style="s2">just so that they can go back to</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.369" end="01:08:10.569" style="s2">business as usual tomorrow psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.069" end="01:08:12.549" style="s2">on their own aren&#39;t inherently a</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.569" end="01:08:14.799" style="s2">guarantor of goodness even though they</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.549" end="01:08:16.449" style="s2">make the individual feel good because of</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.799" end="01:08:18.579" style="s2">the goodness of the individual is</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.449" end="01:08:20.859" style="s2">situated within a context that overall</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.579" end="01:08:22.659" style="s2">does not have let&#39;s just call them</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.859" end="01:08:25.960" style="s2">motivations for now that are good for</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.659" end="01:08:27.190" style="s2">everybody then yeah I mean there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.960" end="01:08:28.710" style="s2">of danger that can come from that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.190" end="01:08:31.719" style="s2">know right</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.710" end="01:08:33.520" style="s2">so I mean the circles back again to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.719" end="01:08:35.980" style="s2">beginning where we keep coming back to</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.520" end="01:08:39.730" style="s2">also the the three problems associated</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.980" end="01:08:43.509" style="s2">with the with altered states of</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.730" end="01:08:44.830" style="s2">consciousness yes yes right exactly so</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.509" end="01:08:48.100" style="s2">another thing that I&#39;ve been constantly</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.830" end="01:08:50.650" style="s2">referring to is the classic worry of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.100" end="01:08:53.230" style="s2">devil because the devil he&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.650" end="01:08:55.150" style="s2">scary demonic dude right he is an angel</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.230" end="01:08:58.270" style="s2">of light who comes and seduces you with</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.150" end="01:08:59.440" style="s2">everything you&#39;ve ever wanted and so I</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.270" end="01:09:01.330" style="s2">think that we should be very careful</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.440" end="01:09:05.170" style="s2">that psychedelics might actually be a</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.330" end="01:09:09.000" style="s2">gateway for the devil I mean I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.170" end="01:09:11.620" style="s2">that I think that very seriously I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.000" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s issues here you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.620" end="01:09:16.179" style="s2">Fromm&#39;s critique of the possibilities of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.359" end="01:09:18.370" style="s2">deep modal confusion hmm about having it</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.179" end="01:09:21.489" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s it&#39;s not only our culture</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.370" end="01:09:23.969" style="s2">is the problems around capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.489" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">there&#39;s problems around narcissism</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.969" end="01:09:29.650" style="s2">people would go from understanding</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:31.569" style="s2">psychedelics as a way of becoming and</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.650" end="01:09:34.380" style="s2">instead what they&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.569" end="01:09:36.160" style="s2">have as many experiences that provide</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.380" end="01:09:38.620" style="s2">autobiographical evidence of their</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.160" end="01:09:41.380" style="s2">uniqueness right now your importance and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.620" end="01:09:43.120" style="s2">why they&#39;re special and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.380" end="01:09:45.400" style="s2">and and there&#39;s you know and those two</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.120" end="01:09:47.739" style="s2">things those two those two forces are at</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.400" end="01:09:51.219" style="s2">work they you know it&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.739" end="01:09:54.820" style="s2">because we are in a large complex market</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.219" end="01:09:57.820" style="s2">that we tend to feel that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.820" end="01:10:00.219" style="s2">emphasize our uniqueness but but at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.820" end="01:10:01.480" style="s2">same time we want if we&#39;re conflicted</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.219" end="01:10:03.610" style="s2">about that because we also need to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.480" end="01:10:06.219" style="s2">follow whatever trends are going because</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.610" end="01:10:09.130" style="s2">we want to belong and so there what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.219" end="01:10:12.760" style="s2">saying is it&#39;s a very complex set of</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.130" end="01:10:19.330" style="s2">forces that are going to be at work so I</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.760" end="01:10:23.650" style="s2">think you know there&#39;s there seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.330" end="01:10:25.600" style="s2">to me that we also need something like I</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.650" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">want to be really careful because I do</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.600" end="01:10:29.590" style="s2">not think that getting into a particular</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:31.330" style="s2">ideological stance is helpful here but</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.590" end="01:10:32.770" style="s2">we do need to see something like well</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.330" end="01:10:34.900" style="s2">something like what I see going on with</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.770" end="01:10:39.489" style="s2">my discussions with Jordan Hall sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.900" end="01:10:41.730" style="s2">a level of social cultural critique that</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.489" end="01:10:43.840" style="s2">is not primarily politically motivated</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.730" end="01:10:48.310" style="s2">at least in the standard sense of</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.840" end="01:10:51.250" style="s2">politics but is motivated by and like so</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.310" end="01:10:53.770" style="s2">for example when I&#39;m making a criticism</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.250" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">of capitalism Wow but you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.770" end="01:10:56.690" style="s2">best system and and then you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">being a more</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.690" end="01:11:02.290" style="s2">like no that that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:04.730" style="s2">here what we&#39;re trying to understand is</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.290" end="01:11:06.350" style="s2">Thomas Bjorkman makes this very clear in</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.730" end="01:11:10.810" style="s2">his most recent book you know he said</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.350" end="01:11:13.010" style="s2">you know as as religion left the field</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.810" end="01:11:15.080" style="s2">you know sort of the Enlightenment as</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.010" end="01:11:16.790" style="s2">being the overarching authority and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.080" end="01:11:19.730" style="s2">now science is leaving the field under</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.790" end="01:11:21.500" style="s2">sort of postmodern pluralism he said by</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.730" end="01:11:24.500" style="s2">default all that&#39;s left is the market so</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.500" end="01:11:26.930" style="s2">people are now accrediting to the market</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.500" end="01:11:31.040" style="s2">the same kind of divinity and the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.930" end="01:11:33.710" style="s2">kind of absoluteness and certainty the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.040" end="01:11:35.840" style="s2">market is as it is as fallible as any</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.710" end="01:11:37.940" style="s2">other system or institution we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.840" end="01:11:41.480" style="s2">created does it do a lot of great things</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.940" end="01:11:43.730" style="s2">of course it of course it does but but -</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.480" end="01:11:45.830" style="s2">but there then conclude that it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.730" end="01:11:48.140" style="s2">perfect and complete and we have come to</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.830" end="01:11:49.850" style="s2">sort of the the final stage of</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.140" end="01:11:52.910" style="s2">socio-economic evolution where at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.850" end="01:11:56.480" style="s2">end of history I think that&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.910" end="01:11:58.010" style="s2">absurd and indefensible playing so what</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.480" end="01:12:02.900" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to say is we need a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.010" end="01:12:04.760" style="s2">cultural critique that isn&#39;t truly</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.900" end="01:12:07.880" style="s2">ideologically motivated it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.760" end="01:12:09.380" style="s2">get us out of what try to treat the year</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.880" end="01:12:10.250" style="s2">I&#39;ll use the language we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.380" end="01:12:12.050" style="s2">crafted together</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.250" end="01:12:14.870" style="s2">there&#39;s trying to treat capitalism as an</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.050" end="01:12:18.290" style="s2">object not undermine it or Overmind it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.870" end="01:12:20.840" style="s2">but trying to understand it as it is so</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.290" end="01:12:22.430" style="s2">that we can more appropriately relate to</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.840" end="01:12:24.140" style="s2">it that&#39;s the kind of critique I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.430" end="01:12:26.360" style="s2">you and I are talking about yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.140" end="01:12:28.160" style="s2">yeah I think that you&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.360" end="01:12:29.270" style="s2">clear about that kind of critique of you</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.160" end="01:12:31.010" style="s2">know we can talk about these things</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.270" end="01:12:32.540" style="s2">objectively and not be like</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.010" end="01:12:33.980" style="s2">ideologically motivated and perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.540" end="01:12:35.780" style="s2">actually the answer to these things</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.980" end="01:12:36.260" style="s2">isn&#39;t at the level of the political</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.780" end="01:12:37.610" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.260" end="01:12:39.830" style="s2">right which is the criticism you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.610" end="01:12:41.210" style="s2">lodged against Peterson yeah he wants to</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.830" end="01:12:43.969" style="s2">overly politicized things and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.210" end="01:12:44.719" style="s2">just a that&#39;s an effect it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.969" end="01:12:46.130" style="s2">not really a cause</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.719" end="01:12:48.500" style="s2">right it&#39;s causing other problems but</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.130" end="01:12:51.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not like because yes and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.500" end="01:12:52.910" style="s2">why I really enjoy the book Technic and</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.199" end="01:12:54.800" style="s2">magic because you know he also was</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.910" end="01:12:56.840" style="s2">trying to address these sort of more</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.800" end="01:12:58.160" style="s2">political and social problems but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.840" end="01:12:59.870" style="s2">saying look we actually have to change</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.160" end="01:13:01.550" style="s2">the reality systems that were existing</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.870" end="01:13:03.920" style="s2">within such that we can see other</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.550" end="01:13:06.140" style="s2">possibilities for action as available</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.920" end="01:13:08.150" style="s2">yeah and if we take care of the small</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.140" end="01:13:09.630" style="s2">things and the big things will take care</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.150" end="01:13:11.220" style="s2">of themselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.630" end="01:13:12.870" style="s2">you know self-organization is a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.220" end="01:13:14.820" style="s2">force we&#39;re not gonna get outside of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.870" end="01:13:18.600" style="s2">fact that large systems of organization</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.820" end="01:13:22.710" style="s2">are going to happen so the take that</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.600" end="01:13:24.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve always taken to politics is that I</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.710" end="01:13:26.340" style="s2">think that every individual should take</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.690" end="01:13:27.870" style="s2">on the ethic of the anarchist I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.340" end="01:13:30.810" style="s2">think we should try to be like an</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.870" end="01:13:33.060" style="s2">anarchist state could all take on the</p>

<p begin="01:13:33.060" end="01:13:36.870" style="s2">cooperation mutual aid and direct action</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.070" end="01:13:38.220" style="s2">we should all help each other and we</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.870" end="01:13:40.140" style="s2">should all act on the problems that we</p>

<p begin="01:13:40.140" end="01:13:44.100" style="s2">some other higher power to do that for</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.970" end="01:13:46.350" style="s2">us I think that that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.100" end="01:13:48.540" style="s2">thing to internalize on an individual</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.350" end="01:13:51.990" style="s2">level if we all try to engage through</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.540" end="01:13:53.010" style="s2">open honest mutual cooperation I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.990" end="01:13:54.600" style="s2">that&#39;s like a really good way to like</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.010" end="01:13:55.710" style="s2">solve the larger problems take care of</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.600" end="01:13:58.020" style="s2">the small things the big things will</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.710" end="01:14:00.060" style="s2">take care of themselves and then the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.020" end="01:14:02.190" style="s2">larger problems which might be addressed</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.060" end="01:14:03.240" style="s2">by metaphysics come from you know having</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.190" end="01:14:05.400" style="s2">discussions like the ones that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.240" end="01:14:08.130" style="s2">having through the series and through</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.400" end="01:14:09.840" style="s2">having something like the art collective</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.130" end="01:14:12.480" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion yes</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.840" end="01:14:14.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a space where we can go and</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.480" end="01:14:16.650" style="s2">practice and rehearse and get in touch</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.730" end="01:14:18.810" style="s2">with a participatory sense of these</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.650" end="01:14:20.880" style="s2">alternative worlds ultimately I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.810" end="01:14:22.530" style="s2">the framing for that religion that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.880" end="01:14:24.090" style="s2">a religion should be that oh this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.530" end="01:14:25.170" style="s2">like an alien thing which is landed on</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.090" end="01:14:27.000" style="s2">earth it&#39;s getting you in touch with</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.170" end="01:14:29.100" style="s2">some other universe some other dimension</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.000" end="01:14:30.510" style="s2">you go and you participate in the system</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.100" end="01:14:32.310" style="s2">of that dimension and then when you</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.510" end="01:14:33.960" style="s2">leave you take little bits of that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.310" end="01:14:36.420" style="s2">dimension out into the world beyond you</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.960" end="01:14:38.280" style="s2">know it&#39;s so it&#39;s a recovery theory tall</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.420" end="01:14:39.960" style="s2">can actually propose that and that</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.280" end="01:14:40.530" style="s2">anthropological model for fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.960" end="01:14:42.420" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.530" end="01:14:44.760" style="s2">the idea is you go into the alternative</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.420" end="01:14:46.530" style="s2">world you get sort of identified with it</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.760" end="01:14:48.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like an anthropologist going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.530" end="01:14:50.220" style="s2">another culture and the point is when</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.450" end="01:14:52.110" style="s2">you go to that other world you can then</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.220" end="01:14:54.720" style="s2">you sort of take off your cultural</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.110" end="01:14:57.210" style="s2">glasses and then when you return back to</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.720" end="01:14:58.530" style="s2">this world you see it anew and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.210" end="01:15:01.740" style="s2">trying I&#39;ve been trying to get to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.530" end="01:15:05.130" style="s2">idea of seeing religions that way that</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.740" end="01:15:07.110" style="s2">right that what you&#39;re doing but right</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.130" end="01:15:09.390" style="s2">is that the point of it is there there</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.110" end="01:15:11.250" style="s2">are these imaginal places where you go</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.390" end="01:15:13.530" style="s2">and then the point is not to stay there</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.250" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2">not to take them literally the point is</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.530" end="01:15:18.690" style="s2">to come back and see this world in in a</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:21.720" style="s2">different way it&#39;s oh it&#39;s the irony so</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.690" end="01:15:22.440" style="s2">it&#39;s I recover this world as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.720" end="01:15:25.080" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.440" end="01:15:26.820" style="s2">moving to the other world I&#39;m exploring</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.080" end="01:15:27.870" style="s2">this as a way of trying to get outside</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.820" end="01:15:29.640" style="s2">of the two worlds</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.870" end="01:15:33.390" style="s2">you know the idea is to get to the other</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.640" end="01:15:36.810" style="s2">world the truth ology right to me to</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.390" end="01:15:38.430" style="s2">reconfigure so I mean this idea of like</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.810" end="01:15:40.739" style="s2">the trans world it&#39;s not an other world</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.430" end="01:15:42.330" style="s2">it&#39;s you go up you go into this imaginal</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.739" end="01:15:44.670" style="s2">things so that you come back into this</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.330" end="01:15:46.199" style="s2">one and recover it in a powerful way</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.670" end="01:15:48.000" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s cool I didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.199" end="01:15:49.170" style="s2">I&#39;m a token actually no I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.000" end="01:15:50.310" style="s2">that and I can definitely see that in</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.170" end="01:15:51.090" style="s2">Lord of the Rings because it is very</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.310" end="01:15:52.980" style="s2">much a critique of like the</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.090" end="01:15:59.250" style="s2">industrialization of the time he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.980" end="01:16:00.239" style="s2">living in yeah hmm so actually one thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.250" end="01:16:02.100" style="s2">that I was just thinking today as I was</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.239" end="01:16:03.150" style="s2">sort of brainstorming for this which got</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.100" end="01:16:05.100" style="s2">brought to mind again as you were</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.150" end="01:16:06.750" style="s2">talking about the to world thing so I</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.100" end="01:16:09.000" style="s2">think that we are situated within a</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.750" end="01:16:10.860" style="s2">Platonic view of the two worlds mmm so</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.000" end="01:16:13.500" style="s2">the one core distinction that I see</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.860" end="01:16:14.880" style="s2">between Aristotle and Plato is that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.500" end="01:16:16.710" style="s2">know Aristotle recognizes that</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.880" end="01:16:18.780" style="s2">potentiality is really important but</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.710" end="01:16:20.550" style="s2">then Plato says potentiality is actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.780" end="01:16:22.920" style="s2">more real than like the actual world</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.550" end="01:16:24.900" style="s2">itself so Plato doesn&#39;t distinguish he</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.920" end="01:16:27.510" style="s2">says that the potential world is more</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.900" end="01:16:30.030" style="s2">pure because it&#39;s like not corrupted by</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.510" end="01:16:32.820" style="s2">the process of becoming and it has not</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.030" end="01:16:34.140" style="s2">only the same but more of an ontological</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.820" end="01:16:36.900" style="s2">status than the world of everyday</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.140" end="01:16:38.580" style="s2">appearances but I think that that is not</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.900" end="01:16:39.719" style="s2">correct I think that we can sort of put</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.580" end="01:16:42.180" style="s2">that to the side we can see that</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.719" end="01:16:44.820" style="s2">potentiality is a thing that genuinely</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.180" end="01:16:46.620" style="s2">is real um but it&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.820" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">different from that which is actual yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.620" end="01:16:50.640" style="s2">so when we go though into this</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:52.170" style="s2">institution this you know whether it be</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.640" end="01:16:54.090" style="s2">a religion of times past let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.170" end="01:16:56.460" style="s2">Christianity for example we can go to</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.090" end="01:16:58.199" style="s2">Christianity and by participating within</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.460" end="01:17:01.110" style="s2">that community we discover the</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.199" end="01:17:03.630" style="s2">possibility of God and we actualize that</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.110" end="01:17:05.760" style="s2">potential by bringing to light that</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.630" end="01:17:07.949" style="s2">potential through the community and how</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.760" end="01:17:09.900" style="s2">the community interacts so it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.949" end="01:17:12.930" style="s2">realize and bring to life God we</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.900" end="01:17:15.150" style="s2">discover and life to the potential of</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.930" end="01:17:17.940" style="s2">God which is a transductive way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.150" end="01:17:20.699" style="s2">yeah again it&#39;s not that gods in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.940" end="01:17:23.430" style="s2">other world it&#39;s is that God is a way</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.699" end="01:17:25.800" style="s2">like I say if God is this way of going</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.430" end="01:17:27.780" style="s2">out and coming back and recovering our</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.800" end="01:17:32.699" style="s2">world that&#39;s what you&#39;ve just described</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.780" end="01:17:34.920" style="s2">in a way so I was reading being called</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.699" end="01:17:35.930" style="s2">which is an anthology oh yeah yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.920" end="01:17:37.910" style="s2">book I&#39;ve got the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.930" end="01:17:40.520" style="s2">don&#39;t say too much cuz I don&#39;t want you</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.910" end="01:17:43.580" style="s2">to spoil for me go ahead I will spoil</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.520" end="01:17:45.920" style="s2">the intro okay okay Martin Seligman he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.580" end="01:17:48.170" style="s2">the founder of positive psychology one</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.920" end="01:17:49.970" style="s2">of them yeah yeah yeah so he goes off on</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.170" end="01:17:52.190" style="s2">this really weird tangent I love it so</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.970" end="01:17:53.390" style="s2">much like life is becoming so weird and</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.190" end="01:17:55.700" style="s2">like we just gotta like buckle down and</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.390" end="01:17:57.170" style="s2">accept it okay then this guy who&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.700" end="01:17:59.780" style="s2">well respected psychologist you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.170" end="01:18:01.820" style="s2">really well-known published so many</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.780" end="01:18:03.170" style="s2">articles classes are taught throughout</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.820" end="01:18:04.850" style="s2">the world based on his teachings and</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.170" end="01:18:06.620" style="s2">he&#39;s like yeah you know I think that</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.850" end="01:18:10.430" style="s2">science fiction is like a really useful</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.620" end="01:18:12.530" style="s2">place to get some insights about how the</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.430" end="01:18:15.050" style="s2">experience of being called by some</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.530" end="01:18:17.630" style="s2">higher power actually works and so he</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.050" end="01:18:20.360" style="s2">refers to a story by him I think to this</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.630" end="01:18:21.710" style="s2">story you know it&#39;s blending in my brain</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.360" end="01:18:23.690" style="s2">right now I have to follow up on it but</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.710" end="01:18:25.550" style="s2">he talks about Isaac Asimov and about</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.690" end="01:18:28.340" style="s2">arthur c clarke and one of these authors</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.550" end="01:18:30.980" style="s2">has a story where there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.340" end="01:18:32.780" style="s2">supercomputer on a spaceship and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.980" end="01:18:33.800" style="s2">universe is cooling down and so the</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.780" end="01:18:35.930" style="s2">people are like okay so how do we</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.800" end="01:18:37.100" style="s2">reverse entropy how do we reverse this</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.930" end="01:18:39.770" style="s2">process so that we can like live</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.100" end="01:18:40.850" style="s2">indefinitely and the computer says well</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.770" end="01:18:42.830" style="s2">you know there&#39;s not enough information</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.850" end="01:18:44.270" style="s2">for a meaningful answer and then so this</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.830" end="01:18:45.590" style="s2">goes on through a series of stages the</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.270" end="01:18:46.820" style="s2">computer gets more complicated and it</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.590" end="01:18:48.440" style="s2">gets more information the people keep</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.820" end="01:18:49.430" style="s2">asking it okay so how do we reverse this</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.440" end="01:18:51.710" style="s2">they&#39;re like you can&#39;t make a meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.430" end="01:18:53.780" style="s2">answer and then when all the people have</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.710" end="01:18:56.390" style="s2">died and we&#39;re almost at like the heat</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.780" end="01:19:00.380" style="s2">death of the universe the computer says</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.390" end="01:19:02.060" style="s2">let there be light and so the insight is</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.380" end="01:19:04.520" style="s2">that you know God isn&#39;t the Creator but</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.060" end="01:19:06.860" style="s2">God actually comes at the end yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.520" end="01:19:10.520" style="s2">is a whitehead sort of had this idea in</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.860" end="01:19:12.350" style="s2">some ways too well yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.520" end="01:19:14.120" style="s2">like an interesting way of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.350" end="01:19:15.740" style="s2">things is we can identify a particular</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.120" end="01:19:17.300" style="s2">kind of potential and we can realize it</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.740" end="01:19:18.830" style="s2">and this is a technique that&#39;s used a</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.300" end="01:19:21.680" style="s2">narrative and in storytelling a lot a</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.830" end="01:19:23.810" style="s2">core difference that emerges at the end</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.680" end="01:19:26.360" style="s2">of a book can recontextualize the entire</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.810" end="01:19:26.830" style="s2">thing such that it&#39;s brought into a new</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.360" end="01:19:30.230" style="s2">light</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.830" end="01:19:32.240" style="s2">I was just gonna say Corona makes great</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.230" end="01:19:35.510" style="s2">use of that about how narrative actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.240" end="01:19:36.860" style="s2">gets our cognition not just the content</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.510" end="01:19:39.440" style="s2">that gets our cognition into the right</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.860" end="01:19:40.820" style="s2">form for interacting complex dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.440" end="01:19:43.310" style="s2">systems in the world precisely because</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.820" end="01:19:46.040" style="s2">of that huge temporal scope and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.310" end="01:19:48.470" style="s2">ability to reorganize at a multi scale</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.040" end="01:19:49.670" style="s2">Euler level nice I feel like she&#39;d be on</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.470" end="01:19:52.550" style="s2">board with the art collectibility</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.670" end="01:19:54.440" style="s2">Yeah right right that&#39;s unschool okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.550" end="01:19:56.060" style="s2">well I think I got a go soon so I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.440" end="01:19:57.619" style="s2">we should this sounds like a good place</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.060" end="01:20:00.409" style="s2">to sort of wrap it up is there any final</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.619" end="01:20:03.739" style="s2">thoughts you want to express anything</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.409" end="01:20:05.570" style="s2">why you feel any threads that need to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.739" end="01:20:07.219" style="s2">sort of quickly gathered together um</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.570" end="01:20:08.739" style="s2">yeah I just wanted to highlight a few</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.219" end="01:20:11.840" style="s2">other directions that I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.739" end="01:20:13.969" style="s2">psychedelics can help us with so I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.840" end="01:20:15.920" style="s2">that everyone should have access to</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.969" end="01:20:17.420" style="s2">rites of passage so transition to</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.920" end="01:20:19.400" style="s2">adulthood something perhaps in middle</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.420" end="01:20:21.320" style="s2">age maybe marriage and death I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.400" end="01:20:23.780" style="s2">that that&#39;s going to be necessary and</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.320" end="01:20:25.010" style="s2">then I think that other people you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.780" end="01:20:27.320" style="s2">can do the more or less I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.010" end="01:20:28.699" style="s2">that most people will value from having</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.320" end="01:20:30.080" style="s2">frequent psychedelic experiences too</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.699" end="01:20:32.150" style="s2">often but rites of passage is super</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.080" end="01:20:33.650" style="s2">important and I also wanted to highlight</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.150" end="01:20:36.080" style="s2">some places that I think are fruitful to</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.650" end="01:20:38.389" style="s2">explore so bodywork and psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.080" end="01:20:40.340" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really been explored yet but I</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.389" end="01:20:42.320" style="s2">was at a conference in Prague which was</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.340" end="01:20:43.820" style="s2">called beyond psychedelics and I was</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.320" end="01:20:46.820" style="s2">talking to a juggler there and he said</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.820" end="01:20:48.080" style="s2">that jugglers love LSD and every time</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.820" end="01:20:50.110" style="s2">he&#39;s learned a new really complicated</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.080" end="01:20:53.389" style="s2">trick he&#39;s learned it well he&#39;s on acid</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.110" end="01:20:55.750" style="s2">and so it actually enhances your body</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.389" end="01:20:59.270" style="s2">awareness it opens you up to more clear</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.750" end="01:21:00.860" style="s2">updates from your embodied signals so I</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.270" end="01:21:02.840" style="s2">think bodywork is something that we</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.860" end="01:21:05.360" style="s2">should be integrating into psychedelic</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.840" end="01:21:08.389" style="s2">research Tai Chi acrobatics yoga that</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.360" end="01:21:10.639" style="s2">kind of stuff and then also expressive</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.389" end="01:21:12.020" style="s2">arts like theater art things that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.639" end="01:21:14.540" style="s2">involve perspective-taking</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.020" end="01:21:16.429" style="s2">yeah for sure for sure yeah those are</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.540" end="01:21:18.800" style="s2">the only things I didn&#39;t get across that</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.429" end="01:21:20.330" style="s2">I wanted to get across otherwise yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.800" end="01:21:22.190" style="s2">this is a great place to end that was a</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.330" end="01:21:23.570" style="s2">lot of fun and it helped me to put</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.190" end="01:21:25.219" style="s2">things in a little bit more clear</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.570" end="01:21:27.650" style="s2">language than I had before well thank</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.219" end="01:21:29.780" style="s2">you and I want to remind see see you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.770" end="01:21:43.489" style="s2">kind of work that&#39;s going in to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.270" end="01:21:45.199" style="s2">cognitive continuum oh I also want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.489" end="01:21:46.880" style="s2">mention that you know I&#39;m integrating</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.199" end="01:21:48.170" style="s2">this idea of utilizing artistic</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.880" end="01:21:51.020" style="s2">metaphorical expression with the book</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.170" end="01:21:53.090" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m hiring artists to provide</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.020" end="01:21:54.409" style="s2">somebody I really thank you for pointing</p>

<p begin="01:21:57.290" end="01:22:01.159" style="s2">exemplifying and enacting them we are</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.420" end="01:22:02.930" style="s2">not merely referring to them we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.159" end="01:22:04.970" style="s2">trying to work out what</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.930" end="01:22:06.620" style="s2">would actually instantiate like how</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.970" end="01:22:08.570" style="s2">would you actually put this into</p>

<p begin="01:22:08.570" end="01:22:14.810" style="s2">trying to work it out in the the</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.260" end="01:22:18.910" style="s2">creation of the book itself so I&#39;m gonna</p>
