<p begin="00:00:01.770" end="00:00:12.019" style="s2">our stops work I don&#39;t know that is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.500" end="00:00:14.190" style="s2">how uh the shutter speed yeah 30 so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.019" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">can tell you a story that you can use to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.190" end="00:00:23.820" style="s2">blackmail me yeah I know okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.619" end="00:00:26.840" style="s2">so when I was an undergraduate I I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.820" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">working very lucky to be working with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.840" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">very famous evolutionary biologist named</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">Bob Traverse we just accidentally ended</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">up at the University of California Santa</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">Cruz where he happened to be and I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">already really deeply interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:43.739" style="s2">evolution and so anyway took his of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.489" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">course I&#39;m Heather and I became friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.739" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">with him he took me to Jamaica to be his</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:50.539" style="s2">research assistant and I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">photographic work I&#39;m he was studying</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.539" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">lizards and he was studying a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:01:00.710" style="s2">called the Hamilton Zook hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">says that the displays that males have</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.710" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">that females require them to show in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:10.340" style="s2">order to to mate with them that these</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:13.590" style="s2">displays actually are evidence of being</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.340" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">free of pathogens that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">they&#39;re what that&#39;s what males are</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">advertising is that they have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">resistant to pathogens and that their</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.630" style="s2">resistance would be something that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">could pass on to offspring so females</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.630" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">would be very interested in it so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">we were looking at dewlaps which are</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:31.829" style="s2">these little flaps that these lizards</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">extend below their necks that are often</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.829" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">colorful and in most species and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">doing the photographic work capturing</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">the images of the dewlap so that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">could be compared and Bob who loves</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:51.030" style="s2">Jamaica Merida Jamaican woman they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">divorced at the point that I was working</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.030" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">with Bob but nonetheless ia&#39;s ensconced</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:02:02.579" style="s2">himself in Jamaican culture as much as</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:05.659" style="s2">possible and loves a good joint as much</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.579" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">or more than the next guy was constantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.659" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">smoking pot while he was working which</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">is not abnormal in a Jamaican working</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:14.730" style="s2">environment the pot isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:16.079" style="s2">strong that it gets in the way if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.730" end="00:02:20.129" style="s2">working so people smoke bother them they</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.079" end="00:02:22.469" style="s2">do work and you know no big deal but he</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.129" end="00:02:26.489" style="s2">kept offering it to me and I had to lay</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.469" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2">down the law with him no pot until we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.489" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">were done working for the morning</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:32.489" style="s2">because I couldn&#39;t keep track of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">damn f-stops since it&#39;s a reciprocal so</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.489" end="00:02:36.689" style="s2">anyway if the f-stops were done in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:39.239" style="s2">other way where they weren&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.689" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">mathematical reciprocal maybe I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.239" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">have smoked pot you know men tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">like use humor like human males use</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:52.169" style="s2">humor yes as a display yes is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">somehow a display of the pathogen-free</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.169" end="00:03:01.319" style="s2">mind no no I really don&#39;t think so but</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:04.169" style="s2">yeah so the thing is this whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.319" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">hypothesis that sexual displays are an</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.169" end="00:03:09.150" style="s2">indicator of being pathogen-free</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:12.299" style="s2">has always struck me as not quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.150" end="00:03:15.799" style="s2">complete enough in other words a female</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.299" end="00:03:19.229" style="s2">doesn&#39;t particularly care whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.799" end="00:03:21.030" style="s2">pathogen-free because your immune system</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.229" end="00:03:23.729" style="s2">is highly functional if your eyesight</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.030" end="00:03:25.079" style="s2">sucks what he cares is that she gets a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.729" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">genome in which everything pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.079" end="00:03:31.129" style="s2">works and so my guess would be that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:34.260" style="s2">hypothesis is wrong then it includes</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.129" end="00:03:36.269" style="s2">cases in which a vulnerability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:37.739" style="s2">pathogens is something that the female</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.269" end="00:03:39.329" style="s2">wants to avoid but really if she wants</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.739" end="00:03:40.979" style="s2">to avoid anything that will get in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.329" end="00:03:43.620" style="s2">way of the well-being of her offspring</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.979" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">and so she&#39;s looking for an integrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.620" end="00:03:50.069" style="s2">measure that says effectively how</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:53.030" style="s2">successful are you in the habitat so</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.069" end="00:03:57.150" style="s2">that does raise the question of why</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.030" end="00:03:59.819" style="s2">males are so often funny and why females</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.150" end="00:04:01.199" style="s2">are so attuned to humor and I will say I</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.819" end="00:04:03.659" style="s2">think this is changing in human beings</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.199" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">in recent years that there has there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.659" end="00:04:11.419" style="s2">long tradition of female comics but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:13.739" style="s2">degree to which women in our society are</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.419" end="00:04:16.769" style="s2">consciously funny rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.739" end="00:04:20.099" style="s2">consciously observers of humor has</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.769" end="00:04:23.719" style="s2">changed a lot I think in my lifetime but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.099" end="00:04:27.080" style="s2">I find it particularly telling that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.719" end="00:04:31.509" style="s2">women actually rate humor very highly</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.080" end="00:04:35.509" style="s2">when they are discussing traits in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.509" end="00:04:38.629" style="s2">potential mates the thing that makes for</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.509" end="00:04:42.020" style="s2">really high-quality humor is the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.629" end="00:04:44.300" style="s2">noticing of stuff that others are aware</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.020" end="00:04:46.069" style="s2">of but wouldn&#39;t think to put words to so</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.300" end="00:04:49.550" style="s2">if you think about you know Jerry</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.069" end="00:04:55.300" style="s2">Seinfeld or some other well-known comic</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.550" end="00:04:58.159" style="s2">the surfacing of certain truths that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.300" end="00:05:00.889" style="s2">easily recognized but that you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.159" end="00:05:08.719" style="s2">heard said before is very very funny and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.889" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">so my guess would be that for young men</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.719" end="00:05:14.990" style="s2">in a traditional environment where</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:17.870" style="s2">success or failure functions according</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.990" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">to whatever men have successful that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.870" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">have succeeded at or failed at that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">the ability to notice that which others</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">can recognize once it said but wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.250" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">think to have said out loud is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">indicator really of a kind of ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:44.569" style="s2">spot opportunity also there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.199" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">very interesting in the fact that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.569" end="00:05:50.690" style="s2">if you&#39;ve ever watched some hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.240" end="00:05:52.729" style="s2">organization where there&#39;s some person</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.690" end="00:05:54.590" style="s2">often a guy at the very top of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.729" end="00:05:59.449" style="s2">organization you know the CEO of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.590" end="00:06:02.300" style="s2">company and they can tell really lousy</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.449" end="00:06:04.610" style="s2">jokes just low-quality jokes from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.300" end="00:06:07.340" style="s2">point of view of timing or anything but</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.610" end="00:06:10.550" style="s2">it causes a lot of laughter so to an</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.340" end="00:06:15.740" style="s2">extent in a classic environment a female</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.550" end="00:06:19.129" style="s2">who was noticing that a man was causing</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.740" end="00:06:21.560" style="s2">others to laugh would be able to detect</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.129" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">two things one either that man is able</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.560" end="00:06:25.909" style="s2">to notice things that others aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:28.250" style="s2">capable of noticing and that that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.909" end="00:06:30.409" style="s2">be potentially a good bet for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.250" end="00:06:32.599" style="s2">who would find an opportunity in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.409" end="00:06:34.250" style="s2">marketplace or in a habitat or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.599" end="00:06:37.430" style="s2">some opportunity to others had missed or</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.250" end="00:06:40.099" style="s2">that a man has the kind of power that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.430" end="00:06:40.550" style="s2">causes others to laugh at their jokes in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.099" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.550" end="00:06:44.270" style="s2">to ingratiate themselves and either one</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:46.970" style="s2">is good from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.270" end="00:06:48.830" style="s2">picking a mate who is liable to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.970" end="00:06:50.990" style="s2">position to provide well for a family</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.830" end="00:06:52.310" style="s2">and protect them things like that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.990" end="00:06:54.020" style="s2">entertain you along the way and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.310" end="00:06:56.060" style="s2">entertain you along the way yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.020" end="00:06:58.490" style="s2">have that classic thing that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.060" end="00:07:00.740" style="s2">don&#39;t know if women really did say it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.490" end="00:07:02.780" style="s2">very much but you know he makes me laugh</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.740" end="00:07:08.450" style="s2">that that&#39;s a really strong positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.780" end="00:07:10.850" style="s2">sign would be yeah exactly well so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.450" end="00:07:13.730" style="s2">said that that one one formulation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.850" end="00:07:16.430" style="s2">humor is the putting together of things</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.730" end="00:07:17.780" style="s2">in a way we&#39;re making an observation in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.430" end="00:07:20.330" style="s2">a way that other people&#39;s haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.780" end="00:07:22.970" style="s2">so there&#39;s a novelty aspect but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.330" end="00:07:25.610" style="s2">humor but isn&#39;t wisdom a version of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.970" end="00:07:27.980" style="s2">viewing that as wisdom related to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.610" end="00:07:31.010" style="s2">foolishness well let&#39;s talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.980" end="00:07:34.690" style="s2">about about way stuff so the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.010" end="00:07:37.760" style="s2">to realize is that wisdom has a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.690" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">relationship to intelligence but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.760" end="00:07:41.750" style="s2">not a straightforward linear</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:43.580" style="s2">relationship that it is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.750" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">possible for a person to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.580" end="00:07:50.300" style="s2">smart and very unwise and that in</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:52.760" style="s2">recognizing you know in taking that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.300" end="00:07:56.210" style="s2">smart person who is unwise and basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.760" end="00:07:57.830" style="s2">subtracting the wisdom from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.210" end="00:08:00.230" style="s2">intelligence we can figure out what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.830" end="00:08:02.180" style="s2">actually contains that&#39;s special and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.230" end="00:08:07.370" style="s2">what I would argue is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.180" end="00:08:12.740" style="s2">lots of things that are just simply true</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.370" end="00:08:15.350" style="s2">that one can notice or calculate but</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.740" end="00:08:18.410" style="s2">that there are also lots of effects that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.350" end="00:08:25.669" style="s2">you know exist a couple of levels up</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.410" end="00:08:28.549" style="s2">that cause the simple calculation to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.669" end="00:08:33.769" style="s2">misleading with respect to ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.549" end="00:08:37.849" style="s2">what is valuable so there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.769" end="00:08:41.779" style="s2">which a wise person knows not only how</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.849" end="00:08:44.360" style="s2">to calculate what&#39;s true but knows how</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.779" end="00:08:45.980" style="s2">to wait a bunch of truths relative to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.360" end="00:08:48.949" style="s2">each other in order to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.980" end="00:08:51.319" style="s2">the best pathway through something might</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.949" end="00:08:53.540" style="s2">be so it&#39;s it&#39;s basically an integrative</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.319" end="00:08:57.230" style="s2">function rather than a raw mental</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.540" end="00:09:01.660" style="s2">horsepower function one thing I find</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.230" end="00:09:06.470" style="s2">myself noticing as a parent and as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.660" end="00:09:09.259" style="s2">professor of many students is that one</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.470" end="00:09:12.470" style="s2">of the things about youth that tends to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.259" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">get in the way of children or college</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.470" end="00:09:19.490" style="s2">students is that they don&#39;t they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:21.980" style="s2">impatient about certain things that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.490" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">very important not to be impatient about</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.980" end="00:09:29.389" style="s2">and so for example if you are interested</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:31.129" style="s2">in solving deep analytical puzzles right</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.389" end="00:09:35.449" style="s2">if that&#39;s your taste you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.129" end="00:09:40.040" style="s2">you know why why males in some species</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.449" end="00:09:42.230" style="s2">display these elaborate flashy dances or</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.040" end="00:09:45.259" style="s2">plumage or whatever that&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.230" end="00:09:48.230" style="s2">question and if you have to know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.259" end="00:09:49.879" style="s2">answer right now well then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.230" end="00:09:52.009" style="s2">going to make it because the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.879" end="00:09:52.910" style="s2">nobody who studied the question has</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.009" end="00:09:54.170" style="s2">gotten there yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.910" end="00:09:56.839" style="s2">so you&#39;re gonna have to do something</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.170" end="00:10:00.319" style="s2">better than all of those very smart</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.839" end="00:10:02.269" style="s2">people who have attempted and largely</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.319" end="00:10:04.069" style="s2">failed to this point to fully answer the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.269" end="00:10:05.059" style="s2">question we know some something about</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.069" end="00:10:09.850" style="s2">the answer but we don&#39;t know it fully</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.059" end="00:10:12.730" style="s2">and so what are you gonna do differently</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.850" end="00:10:18.649" style="s2">well one thing you might do differently</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.730" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">is file the question in a place that as</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.649" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">information that&#39;s relevant to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:26.360" style="s2">answer passes in front of you in one way</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:29.329" style="s2">or another you collect it and you build</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.360" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">a model and you begin to test hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.329" end="00:10:34.459" style="s2">rather than feeling like oh my god we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:37.550" style="s2">been lecturing about sexual selection</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.459" end="00:10:37.759" style="s2">for two and a half hours now just tell</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.550" end="00:10:38.420" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.759" end="00:10:40.579" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.420" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">why are these animals doing this crazy</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.579" end="00:10:49.490" style="s2">stuff so I guess what I would what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:52.310" style="s2">would say is that I&#39;m not sure I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.490" end="00:10:55.570" style="s2">say it is the core of wisdom but I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.310" end="00:10:59.209" style="s2">certainly say it is a core of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.570" end="00:11:02.170" style="s2">delayed gratification delayed</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.209" end="00:11:06.290" style="s2">gratification is one of the central</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.170" end="00:11:08.630" style="s2">pieces of wisdom the ability to invest</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.290" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2">in something in the present in a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.630" end="00:11:13.160" style="s2">that it may be costly while knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.420" end="00:11:15.019" style="s2">what you&#39;re pursuing is some benefit</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.160" end="00:11:16.459" style="s2">that may be substantially down the road</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.019" end="00:11:23.089" style="s2">and if you think about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.459" end="00:11:27.100" style="s2">between the way the way highly</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.089" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">successful adults and very smart kids</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.100" end="00:11:32.230" style="s2">behave you&#39;ll realize that the very</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:34.639" style="s2">smart kid is very eager to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.230" end="00:11:39.290" style="s2">exactly what they&#39;ve got and the wise</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.639" end="00:11:41.810" style="s2">adult may be willing to you know be</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.290" end="00:11:43.880" style="s2">working on something that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.810" end="00:11:45.320" style="s2">obviously a value for most of the period</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.880" end="00:11:47.810" style="s2">of time that they&#39;re working on it in an</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.320" end="00:11:49.820" style="s2">effort to six months or a year or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.810" end="00:11:51.589" style="s2">even five years down the road have</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.820" end="00:11:54.110" style="s2">something that&#39;s worth all of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.589" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">investment to show for the project so</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.110" end="00:12:03.050" style="s2">the ability to to understand that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:05.480" style="s2">are investing at a cost now for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.050" end="00:12:08.170" style="s2">benefit that will only emerge much later</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.480" end="00:12:08.170" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.350" end="00:12:13.300" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe the most important lesson</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.530" end="00:12:15.660" style="s2">that takes a smart person allows them to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.300" end="00:12:19.210" style="s2">become wise and that&#39;s a lesson that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.660" end="00:12:21.790" style="s2">takes time to learn well that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.210" end="00:12:25.480" style="s2">question is how how does an impatient</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.790" end="00:12:28.090" style="s2">young person ever discover this because</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.480" end="00:12:32.460" style="s2">that impatience will cause them never to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.090" end="00:12:35.140" style="s2">happen on to to a situation in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.460" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">this style of looking at things pays off</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.140" end="00:12:39.670" style="s2">so in some sense one of the tragedies of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:41.950" style="s2">wisdom is that it isn&#39;t automatic that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.670" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">you accumulate it simply if you live</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.950" end="00:12:48.730" style="s2">enough years you tend to get wiser but</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:49.990" style="s2">you don&#39;t necessarily get what we you</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.730" end="00:12:54.450" style="s2">know we don&#39;t say most most people</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.990" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t wise most people are too easily</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.450" end="00:13:02.440" style="s2">trapped by the false promise of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:08.110" style="s2">get-rich-quick scheme or some idea that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.440" end="00:13:10.810" style="s2">seems incredibly promising but doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.110" end="00:13:17.110" style="s2">pan out whereas something like you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.810" end="00:13:19.990" style="s2">an inventor may build dozens of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.110" end="00:13:22.300" style="s2">prototypes each one of which will suck</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.990" end="00:13:26.200" style="s2">up resources and time and none of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.300" end="00:13:28.870" style="s2">will save enough labor or provide enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.200" end="00:13:31.060" style="s2">extra value to justify what was put into</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.870" end="00:13:33.730" style="s2">it but that isn&#39;t their purpose their</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.060" end="00:13:35.320" style="s2">purpose is to discover what you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.730" end="00:13:37.330" style="s2">know about the process of building the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.320" end="00:13:39.700" style="s2">object in order to get it to work really</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.330" end="00:13:45.130" style="s2">well so one way to say it might be that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.700" end="00:13:47.980" style="s2">the the product of prototypes is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.130" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">improved mental model rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.980" end="00:13:52.840" style="s2">object itself and in fact this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">the things I always wonder why nobody</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.840" end="00:13:56.920" style="s2">says this to college students but</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:13:59.380" style="s2">college students produce a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.920" end="00:14:01.930" style="s2">during college those of us who have</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.380" end="00:14:04.110" style="s2">graduated from college realize that very</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.930" end="00:14:08.220" style="s2">few things that we produced in college</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.110" end="00:14:11.020" style="s2">are ever published or seen by anybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.220" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">they don&#39;t matter and that isn&#39;t their</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.020" end="00:14:16.690" style="s2">purpose the purpose is in learning to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:19.960" style="s2">produce them your mind is enhanced such</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.690" end="00:14:21.490" style="s2">that later on when you decide what it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.960" end="00:14:22.629" style="s2">that needs to be produced in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.490" end="00:14:24.519" style="s2">or what it is that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.629" end="00:14:29.319" style="s2">contribute you&#39;d have the tools to go</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.519" end="00:14:33.339" style="s2">about doing it and so I often fear that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.319" end="00:14:36.309" style="s2">because the work that takes place in</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.339" end="00:14:40.540" style="s2">school looks a lot like the work that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.309" end="00:14:43.899" style="s2">takes place in a job that students think</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.540" end="00:14:46.420" style="s2">that their purpose in school is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.899" end="00:14:49.209" style="s2">production of stuff in production of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.420" end="00:14:51.009" style="s2">papers or something rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.209" end="00:14:52.389" style="s2">production of an enhanced mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.009" end="00:14:54.100" style="s2">capable of being pointed at very</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.389" end="00:14:55.779" style="s2">different problems later it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.100" end="00:14:59.290" style="s2">production of value but the production</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.779" end="00:15:02.559" style="s2">of the capacity to create value that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.290" end="00:15:05.709" style="s2">well sent the production of tools sharp</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.559" end="00:15:07.749" style="s2">enough to do something refined later on</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.709" end="00:15:10.899" style="s2">and hands adroit enough to wield those</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.749" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">right so how do you how do you teach</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.899" end="00:15:18.490" style="s2">wisdom well there then failure oddly you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:21.639" style="s2">know first of all there are a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.639" end="00:15:25.929" style="s2">the un-- one of the foolish things about</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.559" end="00:15:28.959" style="s2">our educational system is that it tends</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.929" end="00:15:31.299" style="s2">to shunt us all into some idealized</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.959" end="00:15:33.129" style="s2">model of how to convey things like</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.299" end="00:15:35.049" style="s2">wisdom and because it&#39;s such a poor</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.129" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">match for most of us we&#39;re not very</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.049" end="00:15:41.379" style="s2">effective at it so discovering that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:42.429" style="s2">way you teach wisdom may be very</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.379" end="00:15:44.139" style="s2">different from the way somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.429" end="00:15:47.529" style="s2">teaches wisdom and that that is not an</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.139" end="00:15:53.189" style="s2">indictment of either method is one kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.529" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">of wisdom but I would say for me the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.189" end="00:16:06.100" style="s2">recognition that far too much of what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:09.459" style="s2">understand is generated by or is passed</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.100" end="00:16:12.059" style="s2">to us by people who are conveying</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.459" end="00:16:14.259" style="s2">something on some authority and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.059" end="00:16:16.839" style="s2">indicted it by saying it&#39;s authority it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.259" end="00:16:19.540" style="s2">may be that a chemist is telling you how</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.839" end="00:16:21.639" style="s2">a reaction works based on long years of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.540" end="00:16:23.259" style="s2">exposure to chemistry but from the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.639" end="00:16:25.660" style="s2">of view of the person who&#39;s listening to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.259" end="00:16:27.730" style="s2">that lecture this isn&#39;t something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.660" end="00:16:28.990" style="s2">you&#39;ve established yourself this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.730" end="00:16:30.759" style="s2">something that you&#39;re taking on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.990" end="00:16:34.329" style="s2">authority of the chemist who who told</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.759" end="00:16:35.200" style="s2">you that and so the problem is with</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.329" end="00:16:37.300" style="s2">chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.200" end="00:16:39.940" style="s2">you can be pretty sure that if somebody</p>

<p begin="00:16:39.940" end="00:16:45.640" style="s2">processes is telling you XY and z are</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.150" end="00:16:48.340" style="s2">true they probably are on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.640" end="00:16:50.380" style="s2">there are a lot of things over you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.340" end="00:16:52.750" style="s2">in the humanities the social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.380" end="00:16:56.200" style="s2">even biology which is so complicated</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.750" end="00:17:01.780" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have a complete model of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.200" end="00:17:04.150" style="s2">it it is very easy to be lured into</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.780" end="00:17:06.579" style="s2">believing things that sound like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.150" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">right and the authorities believe are</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.579" end="00:17:13.900" style="s2">right that are actually false so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:16.600" style="s2">no shortage of such such things that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.900" end="00:17:20.440" style="s2">know have compelled people and mislead</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.600" end="00:17:23.890" style="s2">them deeply like the idea that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.440" end="00:17:28.690" style="s2">depression is in general the result of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.890" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">chemical imbalance right or that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.690" end="00:17:36.940" style="s2">addiction results because of a cycle in</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:39.100" style="s2">which your body simply comes to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.940" end="00:17:40.270" style="s2">dependent on the molecule that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.100" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">introduced and when you take that</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.270" end="00:17:44.380" style="s2">molecule away you suffer from a deficit</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:46.090" style="s2">of it it&#39;s not that there&#39;s no truth in</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.380" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">either of these there are cases of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.090" end="00:17:50.890" style="s2">depression being the result of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:53.980" style="s2">chemical imbalance but depression is</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.890" end="00:17:57.220" style="s2">also likely to result from circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.980" end="00:17:59.290" style="s2">that are very difficult to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.220" end="00:18:02.440" style="s2">especially developmental circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.290" end="00:18:07.690" style="s2">can build counterproductive patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.440" end="00:18:10.690" style="s2">addiction we now know is in large</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.690" end="00:18:13.950" style="s2">measure the result of not having good</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.690" end="00:18:17.560" style="s2">options that whether we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.950" end="00:18:20.770" style="s2">animal models or people that people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.560" end="00:18:22.390" style="s2">have rewarding stuff to choose are much</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.770" end="00:18:24.610" style="s2">less likely to become addicted and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.390" end="00:18:28.180" style="s2">people become addicted to various things</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.610" end="00:18:30.220" style="s2">like opiates when they&#39;re stuck so</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.180" end="00:18:33.010" style="s2">getting people unstuck is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.220" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">key my point my point is that both of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.010" end="00:18:38.800" style="s2">these models lasted for decades where</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:41.620" style="s2">people passed them on as if they were</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.800" end="00:18:43.990" style="s2">true and in fact they were at the very</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.620" end="00:18:45.350" style="s2">least much less than a complete</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.990" end="00:18:49.789" style="s2">explanation of any</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.350" end="00:18:55.450" style="s2">so the result of all this is that one</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.789" end="00:19:00.309" style="s2">should become suspicious of any truth</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.450" end="00:19:02.990" style="s2">that is heavily dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.309" end="00:19:05.149" style="s2">accuracy of some authorities</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.990" end="00:19:07.159" style="s2">understanding of something that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.149" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">complex enough that the authority could</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.159" end="00:19:10.700" style="s2">actually be wrong and you would have no</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:12.139" style="s2">way of knowing and a cure for that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.700" end="00:19:15.769" style="s2">answer to your question about how you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.139" end="00:19:19.580" style="s2">teach people to be wise is you induce</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.769" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">them to confront some system in which</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.580" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">authority plays little or no role so for</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:31.730" style="s2">example if you let&#39;s say you take up</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:34.340" style="s2">robotics and what you&#39;re gonna do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.730" end="00:19:36.500" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna build little robots that do</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.340" end="00:19:39.620" style="s2">funny things and aren&#39;t especially</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.500" end="00:19:41.659" style="s2">useful to anybody nonetheless if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.620" end="00:19:43.909" style="s2">gonna build a robot and you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.659" end="00:19:47.389" style="s2">get it to accomplish something</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.909" end="00:19:49.580" style="s2">well you can&#39;t fool the robot into</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.389" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">function either you&#39;ve put the parts</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.580" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">together in a way that is logical that</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:56.210" style="s2">is capable of lifting the loads that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.990" end="00:19:58.009" style="s2">you&#39;re intending it to lift or you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.210" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">miss calculated in it it won&#39;t lift</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.009" end="00:20:03.019" style="s2">those loads or it won&#39;t behave in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">coordinated fashion and so the the key</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.019" end="00:20:11.059" style="s2">is that any system in which you will</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:12.980" style="s2">know at the point that you have actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.059" end="00:20:16.129" style="s2">come to understand the system because</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.980" end="00:20:19.429" style="s2">the object itself will work or in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.129" end="00:20:21.769" style="s2">different case knowing a natural system</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.429" end="00:20:24.409" style="s2">well enough that you can predict things</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.769" end="00:20:26.659" style="s2">you don&#39;t know about where to find a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.409" end="00:20:29.269" style="s2">creature or how that creature is likely</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.659" end="00:20:31.850" style="s2">to behave and responds to some stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.269" end="00:20:34.429" style="s2">or something those systems are ones in</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.850" end="00:20:36.440" style="s2">which you are incapable of deluding</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.429" end="00:20:39.379" style="s2">yourself into believing attractive</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:43.879" style="s2">fictions because if what you believe is</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.379" end="00:20:47.169" style="s2">false it won&#39;t be effective so I am a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.879" end="00:20:50.269" style="s2">strong advocate for the idea of taking</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.169" end="00:20:52.970" style="s2">authority out of the role of training</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.269" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">your mind to function well to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.970" end="00:20:57.559" style="s2">possible there is a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.070" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">Authority and wisdom like the wise man</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.559" end="00:21:03.980" style="s2">or at least within the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.360" end="00:21:06.470" style="s2">and cultural sphere those who are wise</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.980" end="00:21:07.940" style="s2">tend to be given a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.470" end="00:21:10.630" style="s2">authority or they&#39;re speaking from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.940" end="00:21:10.630" style="s2">position of authority</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.330" end="00:21:15.890" style="s2">absolutely but did they earn that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.850" end="00:21:18.370" style="s2">authority perhaps or well you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.890" end="00:21:22.030" style="s2">they&#39;re certainly false</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.370" end="00:21:25.580" style="s2">there&#39;s false wisdom you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.030" end="00:21:28.700" style="s2">self-help gurus that aren&#39;t in fact very</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.580" end="00:21:32.470" style="s2">insightful on the other hand what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.700" end="00:21:36.169" style="s2">will tend to discover if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.470" end="00:21:39.590" style="s2">what people who are actually understood</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.169" end="00:21:43.880" style="s2">to be wise tend to say is it it often</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.590" end="00:21:46.520" style="s2">has a counterintuitive kind of ring to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.880" end="00:21:50.620" style="s2">it right</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.520" end="00:21:54.890" style="s2">and so that counterintuitive Ness is</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.620" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">about it&#39;s really a product of not</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.890" end="00:21:58.160" style="s2">leaping to conclusions the intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:00.620" style="s2">conclusion seems right and you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.160" end="00:22:03.530" style="s2">convince yourself that it&#39;s true the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.620" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">wise conclusion requires you to step</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.530" end="00:22:09.020" style="s2">back and to think more carefully about</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:13.669" style="s2">in what way something might be incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.020" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">so let me give you a cool example this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.669" end="00:22:20.750" style="s2">is from the book Thinking Fast and Slow</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:22.970" style="s2">by Daniel Kahneman he points out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.750" end="00:22:25.490" style="s2">actually he takes the example from a</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.970" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">stint that he did in the Israeli</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.490" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">military in which he was charged with</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:40.340" style="s2">trying to improve the training protocol</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:44.690" style="s2">for fighter pilots and the the trainers</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.340" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">were under the impression that rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.690" end="00:22:49.760" style="s2">people didn&#39;t work and that punishing</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.720" end="00:22:51.710" style="s2">them did work and the reason that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.760" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">thought this was because it was more or</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.710" end="00:22:56.059" style="s2">less reflected in their experience that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:58.010" style="s2">when somebody did something really well</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.059" end="00:22:59.720" style="s2">and you congratulated them for it the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.010" end="00:23:02.419" style="s2">next time they went up and did something</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.720" end="00:23:03.740" style="s2">they tended to do it less well and when</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.419" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">somebody did something really badly and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.740" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">you scolded them for it they tended to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:09.230" style="s2">improve alright and that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.150" style="s2">very straightforward pattern well if</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.230" end="00:23:12.260" style="s2">that&#39;s true if you scold people and they</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.150" end="00:23:14.450" style="s2">do better</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.260" end="00:23:15.980" style="s2">you&#39;re congratulating when they do worse</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.450" end="00:23:18.110" style="s2">than obviously what you should do is</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.980" end="00:23:18.890" style="s2">sculpt them right well no it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.110" end="00:23:21.110" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.890" end="00:23:23.660" style="s2">the pattern is the result of something</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.110" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">called reversion to the mean reversion</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.660" end="00:23:27.740" style="s2">to the mean means that when you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:30.230" style="s2">something better than you usually do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.740" end="00:23:31.700" style="s2">chances are the next time you try you</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.230" end="00:23:33.230" style="s2">won&#39;t do as well right if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.700" end="00:23:34.669" style="s2">throwing darts and you tend to throw</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.230" end="00:23:36.169" style="s2">them at some distance from the center</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.669" end="00:23:37.700" style="s2">and you happen to get one really close</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.169" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">to the center chances you&#39;re gonna pull</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.700" end="00:23:41.690" style="s2">it off twice in a row are pretty low so</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:43.130" style="s2">if you imagine person throws a dart it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.690" end="00:23:44.660" style="s2">gets way closer to the center than they</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.130" end="00:23:45.890" style="s2">tend again you say that was great and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.660" end="00:23:47.450" style="s2">then they throw another dart and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.890" end="00:23:49.250" style="s2">not anywhere near close to the center</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.450" end="00:23:51.049" style="s2">you&#39;ll get the sense that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.250" end="00:23:53.570" style="s2">react well to being congratulated when</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.049" end="00:23:55.309" style="s2">in fact it was just a reversion to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.570" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">mean and that explains the other pattern</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.309" end="00:23:59.210" style="s2">too which is somebody does something</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:01.100" style="s2">really crappy compared to their usual</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.210" end="00:24:02.419" style="s2">and you say how could you possibly have</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.100" end="00:24:04.940" style="s2">screwed that up and then the next time</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.419" end="00:24:07.640" style="s2">they tend to do better that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.940" end="00:24:11.570" style="s2">indication that you&#39;re scolding them did</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.640" end="00:24:14.630" style="s2">them any good so in any case it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.570" end="00:24:16.730" style="s2">takes wisdom to ignore the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.630" end="00:24:22.700" style="s2">pattern seems to reflect this very</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.730" end="00:24:24.350" style="s2">obvious way of organizing rewards and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.700" end="00:24:26.600" style="s2">penalties to get people to succeed and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.350" end="00:24:28.160" style="s2">notices that there&#39;s some entirely other</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.600" end="00:24:30.470" style="s2">reason for the pattern that you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.160" end="00:24:32.179" style="s2">you&#39;ve observed the cleverest scientists</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.470" end="00:24:34.490" style="s2">in my field at least and my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.179" end="00:24:37.669" style="s2">this would be true in every field but in</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.490" end="00:24:42.220" style="s2">my field the cleverest scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.669" end="00:24:44.330" style="s2">the ones that have really good intuition</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.220" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">right we tend to think they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.330" end="00:24:49.190" style="s2">with the the fastest highest horsepower</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:51.830" style="s2">brains and just don&#39;t think this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.190" end="00:24:55.610" style="s2">right they&#39;re the ones that know how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.830" end="00:24:57.710" style="s2">allocate their attention in order to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.610" end="00:25:04.700" style="s2">spot the things that others haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.710" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">or the ones that know the sound of a an</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.700" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">appealing fiction if you can if you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:13.340" style="s2">what an appealing fiction sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:15.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a pretty good chance that those</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.340" end="00:25:18.470" style="s2">appealing fictions may have become the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.530" end="00:25:19.910" style="s2">assumptions that support some wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.470" end="00:25:21.320" style="s2">model and if you&#39;re trying to replace</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.910" end="00:25:24.110" style="s2">that model with one that works better</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.320" end="00:25:25.880" style="s2">than just knowing that something doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.110" end="00:25:27.980" style="s2">quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.880" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">ring true that it&#39;s the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.980" end="00:25:31.430" style="s2">people will have embraced because they</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.630" end="00:25:33.740" style="s2">want it to be true rather than because</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.430" end="00:25:37.220" style="s2">they actually have that that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.740" end="00:25:39.890" style="s2">that gives you a way into puzzles or</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.220" end="00:25:41.060" style="s2">another way of thinking about this let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.890" end="00:25:44.150" style="s2">suppose that you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.060" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">solving big questions in a field where</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.150" end="00:25:49.580" style="s2">there still are lots of big questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:54.550" style="s2">like my field for example well what are</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.580" end="00:25:57.710" style="s2">the chances that you are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.550" end="00:25:59.810" style="s2">smarter in the sense of having a higher</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.710" end="00:26:01.010" style="s2">horsepower brain than all of the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.810" end="00:26:02.260" style="s2">people who&#39;ve looked at those same</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.010" end="00:26:05.060" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.260" end="00:26:07.040" style="s2">vanishing below right there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.060" end="00:26:10.070" style="s2">smart people they pass through all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.040" end="00:26:14.330" style="s2">these fields so what are the chances</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.070" end="00:26:15.980" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to be better read than</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.330" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">all of the people who have looked at</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.980" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">these questions again vanishingly well</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:23.510" style="s2">there will be people who&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.840" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">everything so you need to do something</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.510" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:29.180" style="s2">that distinguishes you in some way in</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:31.250" style="s2">fact you have to overcome the advantage</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.180" end="00:26:33.650" style="s2">of the really well read extremely high</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.250" end="00:26:37.060" style="s2">horsepower brains that have tried to</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.650" end="00:26:42.550" style="s2">traverse that territory ahead of you and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.060" end="00:26:45.530" style="s2">it involves counterintuitive things like</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.550" end="00:26:48.950" style="s2">scrutinizing the observations that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.530" end="00:26:50.210" style="s2">all accepted without question right if</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.950" end="00:26:54.560" style="s2">you go back and look at the observation</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.210" end="00:26:56.870" style="s2">or the the the assumptions of the models</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.560" end="00:26:59.390" style="s2">that they&#39;re using whereas everybody</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.870" end="00:27:03.020" style="s2">else&#39;s instinct is to go forward and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.390" end="00:27:06.830" style="s2">just simply accept the the observations</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.020" end="00:27:08.840" style="s2">and pursue you know things at the remote</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.830" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">edge well should one of those</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.840" end="00:27:13.130" style="s2">assumptions be wrong then that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:17.720" style="s2">your advantage comes from so this</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.130" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">results in a kind of it results in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.720" end="00:27:26.900" style="s2">kind of wisdom and weirdly wisdom has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:27.710" style="s2">kind of slow almost childlike character</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.900" end="00:27:30.659" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.710" end="00:27:33.929" style="s2">isn&#39;t that a contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.659" end="00:27:38.849" style="s2">um yeah why is it a contradiction it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.929" end="00:27:40.409" style="s2">good question I would say Bob Traverse</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.849" end="00:27:42.419" style="s2">pointed out in this paper that I think I</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.409" end="00:27:46.769" style="s2">talked to you about once before where he</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.419" end="00:27:48.239" style="s2">advised people not to take a job any at</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.769" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">any institution that didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.239" end="00:27:51.239" style="s2">undergraduates his point about</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:52.830" style="s2">undergraduates is they don&#39;t yet know</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.239" end="00:27:57.749" style="s2">what questions they&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.830" end="00:28:00.210" style="s2">ask and so they they keep you agile</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.749" end="00:28:01.859" style="s2">because stuff that you&#39;ve long ago given</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.210" end="00:28:03.090" style="s2">up on thinking about they&#39;ll cause you</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.859" end="00:28:04.259" style="s2">to return to it and if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.090" end="00:28:06.179" style="s2">wrong with it you&#39;ll discover it that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.259" end="00:28:09.029" style="s2">way so I guess the point would be if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.179" end="00:28:11.519" style="s2">took all of the questions that people</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.029" end="00:28:14.460" style="s2">don&#39;t ask once they&#39;ve left the early</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.519" end="00:28:16.440" style="s2">stages of some field some tiny fraction</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.460" end="00:28:18.450" style="s2">of those questions are still good and in</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.440" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">fact really good all right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.450" end="00:28:20.129" style="s2">really the thing you should be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:21.809" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.129" end="00:28:24.509" style="s2">but you&#39;ve moved on from the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.809" end="00:28:26.249" style="s2">category well okay now you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.509" end="00:28:29.279" style="s2">stuck competing with everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.249" end="00:28:31.919" style="s2">using the same tools they are and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.279" end="00:28:34.679" style="s2">unlikely to succeed so when I say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.919" end="00:28:38.609" style="s2">the wisdom seems childlike wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.679" end="00:28:42.059" style="s2">like the edit of all of the vast swath</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.609" end="00:28:43.649" style="s2">of undisciplined questions that children</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.059" end="00:28:45.269" style="s2">asked to that small number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.649" end="00:28:46.529" style="s2">undisciplined questions that are good</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.269" end="00:28:48.450" style="s2">enough to point the direction that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.529" end="00:28:49.859" style="s2">everybody&#39;s been missing you were</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.450" end="00:28:51.470" style="s2">talking about that which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.859" end="00:28:54.090" style="s2">counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.470" end="00:28:57.450" style="s2">is kind of has a relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.090" end="00:28:59.729" style="s2">wisdom and you also said that good</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.450" end="00:29:02.129" style="s2">scientists need to have a certain sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.729" end="00:29:05.929" style="s2">of intuition or to be intuitive so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.129" end="00:29:08.669" style="s2">almost like a wisdom is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.929" end="00:29:10.019" style="s2">counterintuitive intuition or an</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.669" end="00:29:11.159" style="s2">intuition for that which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.019" end="00:29:16.460" style="s2">counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.159" end="00:29:17.669" style="s2">I think because wisdom is often phrased</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.460" end="00:29:22.049" style="s2">counter-intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.669" end="00:29:27.869" style="s2">maybe more poetically than other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.049" end="00:29:30.029" style="s2">of truth it liberates one to search in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.869" end="00:29:32.039" style="s2">way that is nonlinear which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.029" end="00:29:34.889" style="s2">oftentimes what you need to do in order</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.039" end="00:29:37.169" style="s2">to find that thing that is missing you</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:33.210" style="s2">everybody else I looked at what the</p>

<p begin="00:32:41.550" end="00:32:48.090" style="s2">you pursue and whether it was completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:51.090" style="s2">conscious or not it became pretty clear</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.090" end="00:32:55.260" style="s2">were pretty darn small and if you did</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.260" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">would end up pursuing would be generally</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.470" end="00:33:03.270" style="s2">pretty narrow they&#39;d be in some little</p>

<p begin="00:33:03.270" end="00:33:07.620" style="s2">or one of a couple of experts but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.280" end="00:33:11.280" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to be the beautiful search</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.620" end="00:33:14.850" style="s2">for marvelous truths that make you smile</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.280" end="00:33:18.420" style="s2">day after day and I think in light of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.850" end="00:33:21.929" style="s2">that that discovery which you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.420" end="00:33:26.490" style="s2">happens in graduate school I started</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.929" end="00:33:28.920" style="s2">doing something else which was I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.490" end="00:33:31.320" style="s2">maybe I didn&#39;t realize how dangerous it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.920" end="00:33:37.590" style="s2">was to building a career but I started</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.320" end="00:33:39.750" style="s2">pursuing answers to questions that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.590" end="00:33:42.450" style="s2">it seemed like we should know but that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.750" end="00:33:43.770" style="s2">we didn&#39;t right so I start that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.450" end="00:33:45.240" style="s2">think of it immediately this way but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.770" end="00:33:48.780" style="s2">sort of started to be like big-game</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.240" end="00:33:51.870" style="s2">hunting like there were things in</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.780" end="00:33:54.660" style="s2">Ellucian area biology which were big</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.870" end="00:33:57.270" style="s2">they were unanswered and nobody really</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.660" end="00:33:59.070" style="s2">knew which direction to go and so sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.270" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">of seemed like they were intractable in</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.070" end="00:34:03.810" style="s2">my feeling was okay why are they</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:12.330" style="s2">intractable and what would it take to</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.810" end="00:34:16.260" style="s2">make them tractable and the I think I</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.330" end="00:34:19.560" style="s2">developed a toolkit for figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.260" end="00:34:22.169" style="s2">to approach those puzzles with enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.560" end="00:34:24.360" style="s2">naivete that I didn&#39;t make the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.169" end="00:34:29.450" style="s2">mistakes as the people for whom they</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.360" end="00:34:33.840" style="s2">were intractable and that became a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.450" end="00:34:39.080" style="s2">tremendous amount of fun but in answer</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.840" end="00:34:42.419" style="s2">to your question you get to what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.080" end="00:34:44.880" style="s2">accept yourself is the right answer to</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.419" end="00:34:47.370" style="s2">some very big puzzle and there is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.880" end="00:34:49.669" style="s2">you know the famous Eureka moment there</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.370" end="00:34:54.630" style="s2">is a minute it&#39;s really it&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.669" end="00:34:58.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a giddy childish feeling but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.630" end="00:35:01.380" style="s2">really it&#39;s marvelous but it does make</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.680" end="00:35:04.590" style="s2">you hungry for the next one right and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.380" end="00:35:06.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which it&#39;s not like I I</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.590" end="00:35:08.970" style="s2">think I found the answer to this great</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.120" end="00:35:13.190" style="s2">puzzle and now I can take it easy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.970" end="00:35:13.190" style="s2">like nowhere do I get more of that</p>
