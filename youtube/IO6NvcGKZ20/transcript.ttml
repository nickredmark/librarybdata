<p begin="00:00:01.170" end="00:00:09.010" style="s2">Well, there were some things I wanted to tell you that were not finished yet</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.010" end="00:00:10.820" style="s2"> in the previous lesson.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.820" end="00:00:14.260" style="s2"> The first was that I told you there are two game modes. But after that I only have</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.260" end="00:00:19.410" style="s2"> one game type explained. So I know you&#39;ve been itching to hear about that ever since.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:20.430" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:20.430" end="00:00:25.940" style="s2"> The first type of game we discussed was where everyone has a specific shared goal.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.940" end="00:00:26.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:26.940" end="00:00:29.279" style="s2"> You can consider that as a structured game.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.279" end="00:00:34.030" style="s2"> But the second type of game that Piaget was interested in was dramatic or &quot;pretend&quot; play.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.030" end="00:00:35.030" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:35.030" end="00:00:42.399" style="s2"> How &quot;pretend&quot; play generally works is ... a child can do it alone,</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.399" end="00:00:46.579" style="s2"> but when it&#39;s teamwork, the kids usually come together,</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.579" end="00:00:51.289" style="s2"> in a small group, and they put on a short play.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.289" end="00:00:54.420" style="s2"> It&#39;s like ... what would you call that?</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.420" end="00:00:56.809" style="s2"> Spontaneous improvisation.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.809" end="00:01:01.309" style="s2"> Maybe they are imitating a family, and each gets a part,</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.309" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2"> that would normally be &quot;mom,&quot; &quot;dad,&quot; and &quot;baby,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:08.659" style="s2"> and maybe &quot;pet,&quot; dog or cat.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.659" end="00:01:12.829" style="s2"> &quot;You are the cat, and you are the mother, and you are the father.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.829" end="00:01:16.780" style="s2"> And then they create a scene.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.780" end="00:01:21.259" style="s2"> Like a table with sheets, which children seem to like,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.259" end="00:01:24.619" style="s2"> and then they play the game.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.619" end="00:01:30.200" style="s2"> In a sense what they do is imitate their parents, or their pet,</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.200" end="00:01:35.079" style="s2"> or the baby. But it&#39;s not exactly imitation, and that&#39;s important to note,</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.079" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2"> because imitation implies ... if you imitate someone, what you do</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2"> is copying what he just did.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:45.460" style="s2"> For example, there are robots nowadays,</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.460" end="00:01:50.259" style="s2"> if you want to teach the robot to do something, maybe the robot has an arm, it has,</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.259" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2"> you can take his arm and do this.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:03.889" style="s2"> And then if you put a can there, he&#39;ll do just that, exactly.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.889" end="00:02:09.350" style="s2"> So you teach him ... he has the ability to imitate movements he has performed before.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.350" end="00:02:10.350" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:02:10.350" end="00:02:13.901" style="s2"> But if you&#39;re a kid and you&#39;re reenacting a family, and you&#39;re the mother,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.901" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2"> then you do not copy the precise movements with your body</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:24.599" style="s2"> that your mother made the last time you saw her, or looked at her.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.599" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2"> What you seem to be able to do instead is watch your mother for extended periods of time,</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2"> and distill something you could describe as her &quot;spirit.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2"> I know that&#39;s not really a psychological or scientific word, but it&#39;s a useful word,</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:45.550" style="s2"> because ... you might say her &quot;personality&quot;, but it&#39;s not exactly her personality,</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.550" end="00:02:49.550" style="s2"> for it is her personality as a mother, which is not really her personality.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.550" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2"> It is the &quot;mother personality,&quot; and that mother personality is something that has already been practiced</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:02:58.970" style="s2"> by mothers from time immemorial.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.970" end="00:03:05.590" style="s2"> And what the child seems to do when, in this example, she looks at her mother,</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.590" end="00:03:10.840" style="s2"> is distilling what is the spirit of motherhood and then embodying it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.840" end="00:03:15.930" style="s2"> So you can think of the spirit of motherhood as those elements of behavior and perception</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.930" end="00:03:24.630" style="s2"> and emotion and cognition, that too ... but all those things are embodied and simultaneously,</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.630" end="00:03:29.750" style="s2"> the common elements of how a mother acts in different situations.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.750" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2"> So you can say, &quot;That&#39;s &#39;mother-like&#39; behavior.&quot; And who knows what that is.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:35.159" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:03:35.159" end="00:03:40.870" style="s2"> What you do is produce the stereotype of a mother, so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.870" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2"> People don&#39;t like stereotypes, especially in psychology, but almost everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:49.230" style="s2"> what you think is in stereotypes. There is not much difference between a stereotype and a category.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.230" end="00:03:52.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:03:54.819" style="s2"> Categories are simplifications, and so are stereotypes.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.819" end="00:03:59.810" style="s2"> Either way, imagine the stereotype of a mother, and the child physically embodies that.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.810" end="00:04:00.810" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:00.810" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2"> What she&#39;s trying to do is become the mother.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:06.549" style="s2"> Why?</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.549" end="00:04:07.890" style="s2"> That is abundantly clear.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.890" end="00:04:10.280" style="s2"> There are obvious reasons why someone does that.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.280" end="00:04:14.150" style="s2"> Because without mothers there would be no people. If we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.150" end="00:04:17.480" style="s2"> Having successful mothers, we would be finished, and we wouldn&#39;t be here</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.480" end="00:04:18.940" style="s2"> to talk about it.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.940" end="00:04:24.580" style="s2"> What Piaget observed was that this kind of drama was extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.580" end="00:04:29.720" style="s2"> was important to children because that&#39;s how they learned how to act like them</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.720" end="00:04:33.350" style="s2"> would be older children, would be teenagers,</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.350" end="00:04:34.350" style="s2"> or young adults.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.350" end="00:04:41.430" style="s2"> It is a &quot;test case&quot; in a relatively safe environment.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.430" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2"> One of the things I&#39;ve been thinking about ... It&#39;s not easy getting the role</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:48.390" style="s2"> of the father, but I think one of the things that dads do,</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.390" end="00:04:53.020" style="s2"> if they are good fathers is that they indicate a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.020" end="00:05:00.470" style="s2"> in the house, or in the family environment, where the children can play undisturbed.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.470" end="00:05:10.231" style="s2"> Because play is also very sensitive behavior. By that I mean it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.231" end="00:05:11.770" style="s2"> to disrupt children&#39;s play.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.770" end="00:05:14.220" style="s2"> If something is wrong with the child, it will not play.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.220" end="00:05:18.030" style="s2"> You can see that your child is doing well when it plays.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.030" end="00:05:21.570" style="s2"> You could say the same about your dog, or perhaps your partner.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.570" end="00:05:26.610" style="s2"> If he&#39;s in a particularly playful mood, there might not be a specific problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.610" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2"> in the relationship, in the moment, and all needs in some way</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:34.120" style="s2"> are more fundamental, are fulfilled.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.120" end="00:05:38.010" style="s2"> So in order for children to play properly, you must indicate a safe area where you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.010" end="00:05:39.320" style="s2"> should take care of.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.320" end="00:05:43.710" style="s2"> And then they can experiment with different ways of being, and they do it on their own,</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:45.850" style="s2"> but also in the company of other children.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.850" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2"> And of course what they do is practice for roles for later.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2"> You see these things in children in different ways, because</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:06:00.470" style="s2"> they don&#39;t just play a parental role, that&#39;s a very common part of children&#39;s play,</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.470" end="00:06:06.510" style="s2"> but they also get fixated on slightly older kids, maybe a year older,</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.510" end="00:06:12.610" style="s2"> or two years older. Who then idolize, follow and imitate,</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.610" end="00:06:15.730" style="s2"> even more direct than they would with a parent.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.730" end="00:06:19.480" style="s2"> The child has reasons for that, and the reason is that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.480" end="00:06:23.660" style="s2"> tries to reach the next stage. So he scans the environment, looks for someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.660" end="00:06:29.490" style="s2"> who seems to have succeeded, whatever that may be, who looks capable, and is friendly,</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.490" end="00:06:35.580" style="s2"> and who tolerates a child following him. And he makes that other his own.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.580" end="00:06:41.590" style="s2"> So play, all the forms of play that we described, the two basic forms, are very</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.590" end="00:06:42.670" style="s2"> important for children.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.670" end="00:06:48.220" style="s2"> And when you see how they &quot;pretend,&quot; you have to realize that as a parent</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.220" end="00:06:53.010" style="s2"> which is an extremely important form of activity, that&#39;s how they become</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.010" end="00:06:54.260" style="s2"> socialized.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.260" end="00:07:00.870" style="s2"> Something else I didn&#39;t mention, this also has to do with Piaget ...</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.870" end="00:07:07.100" style="s2"> We&#39;ve talked about mythology and shamanic initiation lectures</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.100" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2"> the idea that the development of the human personality is a point-by-point upward movement.</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:19.850" style="s2"> So you move forward, and then you run into something in the way, some difficult obstacle,</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.850" end="00:07:24.930" style="s2"> that you block, behaviorally. Because of which you cannot achieve your goal</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.930" end="00:07:29.320" style="s2"> based on your current behavioral plans. Or it&#39;s more complex than that, and it disrupts</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.320" end="00:07:35.710" style="s2"> the entire structure you use to integrate your behavior over time.</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.710" end="00:07:39.330" style="s2"> The difference between the two is like the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.330" end="00:07:44.610" style="s2"> coming home to your partner, or going out with your partner, if people still do,</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.610" end="00:07:50.020" style="s2"> going out with your partner while he is in a bad mood.</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.020" end="00:07:53.780" style="s2"> So you smile at him or tell a joke</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.780" end="00:07:57.750" style="s2"> but you don&#39;t get a response, or he reacts in an angry way. You will orient yourself accordingly,</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.750" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2"> things will sort of fall apart because of that. You may say, &quot;The whole evening is ruined.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:01.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:08:01.800" end="00:08:05.790" style="s2"> You probably aren&#39;t saying, &quot;The whole relationship is over.&quot; But if that happens often enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.790" end="00:08:06.790" style="s2"> maybe.</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.790" end="00:08:10.600" style="s2"> You may say, &quot;The whole evening is ruined.&quot; How likely</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.600" end="00:08:12.900" style="s2"> is a somewhat exaggerated response, so direct.</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.900" end="00:08:17.790" style="s2"> My impression as a clinical psychologist is that when people are difficult to get along with,</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.790" end="00:08:23.160" style="s2"> you have to make them do it three times while you keep an eye on it. &#39;Cause when they do it the third time</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.160" end="00:08:26.210" style="s2"> can you say, &quot;See, you did this.</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.210" end="00:08:27.210" style="s2"> This is what you do. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.210" end="00:08:29.910" style="s2"> And they say, &quot;No, I don&#39;t.&quot; And you say:</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.910" end="00:08:34.789" style="s2"> &quot;Yes, because I saw you do it then, and then, and then.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.789" end="00:08:37.899" style="s2"> And then they are the cigar, you immediately win if you do.</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.899" end="00:08:46.110" style="s2"> But seriously, if it&#39;s just one incident, you better let it go.</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.110" end="00:08:50.190" style="s2"> You don&#39;t have any real proof, and maybe there&#39;s just something small going on.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.190" end="00:08:51.190" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:08:51.190" end="00:08:54.339" style="s2"> Three times, that is quite different. &#39;Cause then you have some credibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.339" end="00:08:58.279" style="s2"> and that&#39;s a good balance between reacting too impulsively ... because</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.279" end="00:08:59.850" style="s2"> you have to stand up for yourself, right?</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.850" end="00:09:02.829" style="s2"> Does that mean you have to respond to every little thing?</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.829" end="00:09:06.269" style="s2"> You will respond all the time if you do, however you want</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.269" end="00:09:08.339" style="s2"> not being a doormat, and let people walk all over you.</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.339" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2"> So you have to find a balance between being tolerant so you don&#39;t have an unnecessary struggle,</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.880" end="00:09:18.520" style="s2"> and be tough so you don&#39;t have an unnecessary struggle. And three is a good number.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.520" end="00:09:19.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:09:19.520" end="00:09:24.860" style="s2"> Anyway you&#39;re out with your partner and he&#39;s annoying</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:27.500" style="s2"> and you can reconstruct your behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.500" end="00:09:31.649" style="s2"> Instead of telling jokes, look at your phone and let it calm down, or something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.649" end="00:09:32.649" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:09:32.649" end="00:09:36.580" style="s2"> You have not changed much in the interpretation framework with which you shape the interaction.</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.580" end="00:09:41.420" style="s2"> The evening is still going as planned, you can still use it</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.420" end="00:09:44.540" style="s2"> of the perceptual structures and the expectations that guided you.</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.540" end="00:09:49.480" style="s2"> They are resized to a very high resolution, in a small way.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.480" end="00:09:53.050" style="s2"> That will upset you a bit, because you will think:</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.050" end="00:09:54.110" style="s2"> &quot;What is going on?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.110" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2"> You might think, &quot;Is something wrong with me?&quot; If you doubt yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:00.370" style="s2"> will you do that. Or maybe you think there is something wrong with him.</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.370" end="00:10:01.370" style="s2"> Whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.370" end="00:10:03.139" style="s2"> But it is not that serious.</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.139" end="00:10:10.639" style="s2"> But maybe you&#39;re out with your partner and someone comes</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.639" end="00:10:15.250" style="s2"> you are in a restaurant, someone comes to the table and says &quot;hello&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:16.389" style="s2"> against your partner.</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.389" end="00:10:19.019" style="s2"> &quot;I didn&#39;t know you had a boyfriend or girlfriend.</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.019" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t tell me that when we went out last week. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:24.790" style="s2"> That&#39;s a completely different scenario.</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.790" end="00:10:29.639" style="s2"> Yeah, and you laugh about it because you know very well that that&#39;s a different story.</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.639" end="00:10:30.639" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:30.639" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2"> And you can ask, &quot;Why does one scenario disturb more than another?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2"> And the answer is something like, if you make assumptions about the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:47.020" style="s2"> Are hierarchically ordered, meaning the small actions you perform</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.020" end="00:10:52.749" style="s2"> are at the bottom of the hierarchy, that&#39;s the micro details, then</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.749" end="00:10:56.980" style="s2"> abstract up, all the way to the top, which might be, &quot;I&#39;m in a faithful relationship.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.980" end="00:11:01.500" style="s2"> There are hierarchical levels of being in a faithful relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.500" end="00:11:06.019" style="s2"> to the small actions you undertake together. The higher</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.019" end="00:11:12.470" style="s2"> you have to go in the hierarchy, the higher the disturbance takes place in the hierarchy,</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.470" end="00:11:15.550" style="s2"> the more upset you will be.</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.550" end="00:11:22.210" style="s2"> So an irritable partner, you can still avoid that, but an unfaithful partner,</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.210" end="00:11:25.899" style="s2"> that&#39;s about the top of the hierarchy, which makes you rethink</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.899" end="00:11:30.230" style="s2"> your past, your present, and your future, and who you are, and who he is,</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.230" end="00:11:34.850" style="s2"> and how men are, and how women are, that is really disastrous.</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.850" end="00:11:35.850" style="s2"> Everything falls apart.</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.850" end="00:11:38.709" style="s2"> That&#39;s the journey to the underworld we&#39;ve been talking about.</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.709" end="00:11:44.060" style="s2"> Piaget had a similar idea with regard to children, as his stage theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.060" end="00:11:45.569" style="s2"> is a point-by-point theory.</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.569" end="00:11:51.629" style="s2"> What he noticed in children was that they were constructing a structure,</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.629" end="00:11:58.389" style="s2"> and a structure is ... I think you can best consider it as a personality.</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.389" end="00:12:02.700" style="s2"> Because a personality has thoughts, and feelings, and motivations, and actions, it&#39;s all those things</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.700" end="00:12:03.700" style="s2"> at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.700" end="00:12:09.860" style="s2"> It is a living &quot;sub-element&quot; within you, and children produce such sub-elements</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.860" end="00:12:15.910" style="s2"> of themselves, which are functional, while &quot;building&quot; themselves from</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.910" end="00:12:25.540" style="s2"> their motor systems, and occasionally they encounter a situation where the tools</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.540" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2"> they&#39;ve built, the &quot;sub-personalities&quot; they&#39;ve built, not the desired one</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:30.600" style="s2"> having effect.</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.600" end="00:12:36.610" style="s2"> That might happen when a three-year-old goes to daycare</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.610" end="00:12:40.209" style="s2"> and don&#39;t make friends.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.209" end="00:12:45.160" style="s2"> And that will ... a child will come home and cry, collapse,</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.160" end="00:12:48.140" style="s2"> and maybe be angry, and tell his parents, &quot;Nobody wanted to play with me.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.140" end="00:12:51.100" style="s2"> They will burst into tears.</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.100" end="00:12:54.740" style="s2"> It&#39;s almost like they are switching from a domain where they are proficient ...</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.740" end="00:12:59.230" style="s2"> feelings, especially negative feelings, indicate that you have passed from</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.230" end="00:13:03.940" style="s2"> the domain where you are competent, to the domain where you are not competent.</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.940" end="00:13:08.339" style="s2"> And when you cry, it is often a sign of distress.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.339" end="00:13:13.190" style="s2"> Sometimes it is anger, but often it is a sign of distress, and it means:</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.190" end="00:13:18.129" style="s2"> “I have found myself in a situation where what I know is no longer sufficient to achieve the desired</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.129" end="00:13:19.410" style="s2"> produce results.</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.410" end="00:13:20.860" style="s2"> So you cry, and then you get help.</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.860" end="00:13:24.360" style="s2"> People come and ask, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; And they pat you on the back.</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.360" end="00:13:29.499" style="s2"> They comfort you, and they may help you strategize what you should</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.499" end="00:13:32.319" style="s2"> can do to improve the situation, or how you could act.</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.319" end="00:13:37.339" style="s2"> Or if you&#39;re a smart parent, you might be playing with your child and offering him ...</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.339" end="00:13:40.500" style="s2"> you improve his social skills.</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.500" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2"> Or you let him play with others more often and keep an eye on his behavior,</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:52.809" style="s2"> and helps him to reconstruct his little sub-personality, integrate more information,</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.809" end="00:13:53.809" style="s2"> so that it becomes more refined.</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.809" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2"> That&#39;s the Piagetian ... this is a combination of the Piagetian ideas of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2"> stage theory, a pointwise upward movement, and that&#39;s the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:08.682" style="s2"> because the previous structure is no longer well attuned to the world, as well as the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.682" end="00:14:10.740" style="s2"> assimilation and accommodation.</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.740" end="00:14:17.230" style="s2"> Piaget turned assimilation and accommodation into opposites in a sense, and it&#39;s not exactly ....</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.230" end="00:14:18.839" style="s2"> It is difficult to determine.</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.839" end="00:14:24.290" style="s2"> But assimilation is for Piaget when you take in information, and the structure,</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.290" end="00:14:27.779" style="s2"> the inner structure it comes into doesn&#39;t really need to change much.</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.779" end="00:14:29.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:14:29.300" end="00:14:33.970" style="s2"> And accommodation is when you take in significant &quot;piece&quot; of information, often negative,</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.970" end="00:14:38.069" style="s2"> and it is so disruptive that the structure you use to understand the information</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.069" end="00:14:39.869" style="s2"> must be reconstructed.</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.869" end="00:14:45.660" style="s2"> Piaget sees it as either assimilation or accommodation, but I think it&#39;s easier to see</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.660" end="00:14:51.509" style="s2"> as a continuum, assimilation taking place at the level of &quot;micro-behavior&quot; ...</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.509" end="00:14:55.350" style="s2"> When you try to pick up a fork and your hand is numb</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.350" end="00:14:59.800" style="s2"> you try to pick up a fork, and it doesn&#39;t work, several times, then you change grip</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.800" end="00:15:00.810" style="s2"> and picks him up.</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.810" end="00:15:02.060" style="s2"> That is somewhat annoying.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.060" end="00:15:06.300" style="s2"> You will look at the fork, and you will try some routines to pick it up,</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.300" end="00:15:10.579" style="s2"> but that won&#39;t collapse your whole world.</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.579" end="00:15:13.840" style="s2"> But if you find a dead mouse in your soup, it will be a whole different story.</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.840" end="00:15:17.059" style="s2"> That is again a matter of hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.059" end="00:15:22.259" style="s2"> So at the bottom of the motor structures, I think it is easy to assimilate,</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.259" end="00:15:29.189" style="s2"> you only have to make small changes in the ... I consider them as maps,</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.189" end="00:15:30.189" style="s2"> cards or personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.189" end="00:15:34.379" style="s2"> I know those two don&#39;t seem the same, but they are very similar.</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.379" end="00:15:39.110" style="s2"> It depends on whether the thing needs a little adjustment or if you have to throw the whole thing away</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.110" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2"> and build something new.</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:45.910" style="s2"> It&#39;s the difference between tightening your car&#39;s lock bolts and buying a new car.</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.910" end="00:15:51.240" style="s2"> You can think of levels of ... you can think of it as levels of complexity.</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.240" end="00:15:56.420" style="s2"> Another way to look at it ... you have to know this because you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.420" end="00:16:00.220" style="s2"> how you determine how upset you should be when something goes wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.220" end="00:16:02.450" style="s2"> That is a very complicated question.</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.450" end="00:16:06.649" style="s2"> If you wake up with a pain in your side, how upset must you be?</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.649" end="00:16:08.189" style="s2"> You do not know.</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.189" end="00:16:11.899" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s nothing, maybe you&#39;ll die of cancer in six months.</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.899" end="00:16:13.200" style="s2"> You do not know.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.200" end="00:16:18.200" style="s2"> So it&#39;s not obvious how people adjust their emotions, when something goes wrong,</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.200" end="00:16:22.550" style="s2"> for the scope of what went wrong is not clear.</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.550" end="00:16:24.550" style="s2"> Your partner is crabby when you go out to dinner.</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.550" end="00:16:26.980" style="s2"> Does that mean you&#39;re going to split up in two weeks?</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.980" end="00:16:28.860" style="s2"> Maybe.</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.860" end="00:16:32.550" style="s2"> So why not go crazy because your world is collapsing?</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.550" end="00:16:36.500" style="s2"> Some people do, they are people with more negative emotions,</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.500" end="00:16:38.190" style="s2"> who score higher on the trait &quot;neuroticism.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.190" end="00:16:44.709" style="s2"> Because they are more likely to respond as if a small, potentially small, anomaly,</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.709" end="00:16:50.030" style="s2"> whether something uncertain, or a threat, or discontinuity, or an unexpected event, is catastrophic.</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.030" end="00:16:54.939" style="s2"> While with an emotionally stable person ... you may have to say, &quot;I break up,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.939" end="00:16:59.670" style="s2"> before they get upset, and even then they might not</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.670" end="00:17:02.040" style="s2"> too much.</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.040" end="00:17:06.280" style="s2"> So you think of the motor hierarchy, of micro-behavior at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.280" end="00:17:10.770" style="s2"> to abstractions at the top, and then you can understand how to estimate</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.770" end="00:17:12.310" style="s2"> how upset you get when something goes wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.310" end="00:17:15.300" style="s2"> Suppose it is small to begin with.</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.300" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2"> Check it at that level.</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:19.280" style="s2"> If you can&#39;t fix it at that level, then level up.</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.280" end="00:17:21.990" style="s2"> If your car doesn&#39;t work, you don&#39;t buy a new one right away.</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.990" end="00:17:27.121" style="s2"> The first thing you do is see if the battery is empty, because that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.121" end="00:17:30.830" style="s2"> can do, and what causes you the least amount of trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.830" end="00:17:35.530" style="s2"> And that&#39;s a very good guide to mental hygiene.</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.530" end="00:17:37.270" style="s2"> It&#39;s like Ockham&#39;s razor.</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.270" end="00:17:39.320" style="s2"> You know Ockham&#39;s razor from science, right?</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.320" end="00:17:41.580" style="s2"> Does anyone know what Ockham&#39;s razor is?</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.580" end="00:17:44.080" style="s2"> How many people know what Ockham&#39;s razor is?</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.080" end="00:17:46.090" style="s2"> How many people don&#39;t know?</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.090" end="00:17:47.750" style="s2"> Oh, that&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.750" end="00:17:48.860" style="s2"> Astonishing.</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.860" end="00:17:50.430" style="s2"> You should know.</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.430" end="00:17:52.250" style="s2"> It&#39;s a shame you don&#39;t know.</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.250" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2"> No doubt that is not your fault.</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:18:05.650" style="s2"> Either way, Ockham&#39;s razor is a phrase that refers to a principle that was established</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.650" end="00:18:13.380" style="s2"> by an old thinker named Ockham, who said, &quot;Don&#39;t multiply your statements more than necessary.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.380" end="00:18:14.380" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:18:14.380" end="00:18:18.990" style="s2"> What he meant was: if you have six reasons why something went wrong,</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.990" end="00:18:27.160" style="s2"> and you can rank them according to their complexity, choose the simplest one,</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.160" end="00:18:31.740" style="s2"> and stay with it until it is disproved, and then take your next simplest one, et cetera.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.740" end="00:18:41.020" style="s2"> It is often used as a guide in science where the idea is: if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.020" end="00:18:45.540" style="s2"> have a simple explanation, don&#39;t complicate it with unnecessary assumptions.</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.540" end="00:18:54.490" style="s2"> It may also indicate a deeper underlying truth, namely that it is unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.490" end="00:19:00.670" style="s2"> that a collection of entities forms a specific constellation, but that it is extremely unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.670" end="00:19:05.090" style="s2"> that they form an improbable and complex constellation.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.090" end="00:19:09.580" style="s2"> Either way, hopefully that&#39;s understandable.</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.580" end="00:19:11.890" style="s2"> You can weave all those ideas together.</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.890" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2"> At the bottom of the hierarchy of your personality are actions, at the top are abstractions,</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:19.920" style="s2"> moral abstractions, such as, &quot;Be a good person.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.920" end="00:19:24.290" style="s2"> When you encounter something unexpected, the degree to which you get upset is proportional to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.290" end="00:19:27.560" style="s2"> the level in the hierarchy where the damage appears to have occurred.</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.560" end="00:19:32.670" style="s2"> You have to guess that somewhat, and you do that partly with your temperament,</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.670" end="00:19:36.800" style="s2"> so if you are highly neurotic, you are gambling &quot;catastrophe,&quot; and if you are not very neurotic, you are gambling &quot;irrelevant.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.800" end="00:19:40.790" style="s2"> And you do that in part because of the way you</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.790" end="00:19:46.570" style="s2"> perceives your own skill. Because when you have smaller and bigger problems in the past</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.570" end="00:19:51.130" style="s2"> even if you are a nervous type, and you have worked it out, you may have learned:</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.130" end="00:19:55.010" style="s2"> &quot;Yes, that&#39;s a problem, but I can troubleshoot so it&#39;s not really a problem.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.010" end="00:19:57.340" style="s2"> That&#39;s a good way to see yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.340" end="00:20:02.160" style="s2"> That&#39;s much better than seeing yourself as, &quot;I&#39;m a problem-free person.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.160" end="00:20:03.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:20:03.160" end="00:20:04.160" style="s2"> Yes, good luck with that.</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.160" end="00:20:08.140" style="s2"> But, &quot;I&#39;m a person who can deal with problems if I focus on them,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.140" end="00:20:10.220" style="s2"> that is very useful.</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.220" end="00:20:15.940" style="s2"> And the other way your nervous system decides how to get upset</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.940" end="00:20:19.380" style="s2"> if something happens is by looking at how other people treat you.</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.380" end="00:20:23.990" style="s2"> And if they treat you as someone who is competent, your nervous system becomes less neurotic.</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.990" end="00:20:26.200" style="s2"> That&#39;s a good way to see it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.200" end="00:20:32.520" style="s2"> You produce more serotonin, you react less generally to error indications.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.520" end="00:20:36.200" style="s2"> All right, Piaget is talking about assimilation.</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.200" end="00:20:40.330" style="s2"> Assimilation is when you have to make a little change, and accommodation is like the whole structure</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.330" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2"> needs to be reconfigured. And he saw that as different</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:51.580" style="s2"> ways of learning, but that is not the case. They are on a continuum, from very simple</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.580" end="00:20:53.040" style="s2"> to very complex.</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.040" end="00:20:56.900" style="s2"> Have you ever heard of the idea of ​​a paradigm shift?</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.900" end="00:20:59.230" style="s2"> How many of you have heard about that?</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.230" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2"> How many not?</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:04.130" style="s2"> Do you know the name &quot;Thomas Kuhn&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.130" end="00:21:05.230" style="s2"> Somebody?</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.230" end="00:21:15.010" style="s2"> No ... well, Thomas Kuhn was a philosopher of science, and he wrote a book in 1962 entitled</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.010" end="00:21:20.590" style="s2"> &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.&quot; And in fact Kuhn said the same about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.590" end="00:21:27.150" style="s2"> the way knowledge structures develop, like what Piaget said about the development of the knowledge structures</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.150" end="00:21:28.860" style="s2"> in an individual.</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.860" end="00:21:34.520" style="s2"> Kuhn was concerned with major transformations in the scientific perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.520" end="00:21:41.750" style="s2"> For example, at the end of the 1890s, physicists were convinced</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.750" end="00:21:44.290" style="s2"> they could close down the whole enterprise.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.290" end="00:21:45.290" style="s2"> Why?</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.290" end="00:21:48.760" style="s2"> Because the physicists knew everything there was to know.</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.760" end="00:21:55.700" style="s2"> There was not a single phenomenon that physicists, at the time, could not explain.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.700" end="00:22:00.450" style="s2"> Except for one, and this is the phenomenon they couldn&#39;t explain.</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.450" end="00:22:07.260" style="s2"> Imagine you&#39;re on a train, and it&#39;s heading that way, at half the speed of light.</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.260" end="00:22:13.700" style="s2"> And you shine with a flashlight, you are on the train (protected from the wind of course),</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.700" end="00:22:19.040" style="s2"> and you shine light going that way. And you measure the speed of light</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.040" end="00:22:21.540" style="s2"> that comes out of your flashlight.</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.540" end="00:22:25.210" style="s2"> The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second, from your flashlight.</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.210" end="00:22:30.740" style="s2"> Okay, now you&#39;re on the ground, watching that train go by.</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.740" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2"> And someone on the train shines a flashlight, and a light comes out,</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:37.220" style="s2"> and you measure the speed of that.</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.220" end="00:22:39.020" style="s2"> What is the speed?</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.020" end="00:22:43.980" style="s2"> You may think, &quot;It&#39;s the speed of light plus half the speed of light,</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.980" end="00:22:47.280" style="s2"> for the train travels at half the speed of light, and the light travels at the speed of light.</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.280" end="00:22:48.280" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:22:48.280" end="00:22:53.500" style="s2"> So the light of the train and lamp combination is the speed of light</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.500" end="00:22:56.780" style="s2"> plus half the speed of light. That&#39;s what would happen if someone threw a ball. ”</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.780" end="00:22:57.930" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:22:57.930" end="00:22:59.470" style="s2"> But that is incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.470" end="00:23:02.680" style="s2"> What happens is that it is the speed of light. No matter how fast you go if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.680" end="00:23:07.650" style="s2"> With your flashlight shining, the light from your flashlight will</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.650" end="00:23:12.300" style="s2"> go exactly 300,000 kilometers per second.</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.300" end="00:23:13.300" style="s2"> 300,000 kilometers per second.</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.300" end="00:23:14.300" style="s2"> It won&#39;t be anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.300" end="00:23:15.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:23:15.300" end="00:23:19.030" style="s2"> So when you&#39;re on the train, and you step back, and you shine the lamp,</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.030" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2"> and someone measures it, is it not the speed of light minus half the speed of light.</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:26.710" style="s2"> Which would be if you were throwing a ball.</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.710" end="00:23:28.380" style="s2"> It&#39;s the speed of light.</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.380" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2"> No one could explain that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:34.440" style="s2"> That was incomprehensible, but everyone ignored it.</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.440" end="00:23:40.690" style="s2"> It turns out you can&#39;t ignore that, and that wasn&#39;t the only thing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.690" end="00:23:44.860" style="s2"> was mapped at the end of the nineteenth century from physics,</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.860" end="00:23:45.970" style="s2"> but it was an important point.</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.970" end="00:23:51.630" style="s2"> And to solve that, Newtonian physics had to be completely overthrown, and replaced with</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.630" end="00:23:52.630" style="s2"> quantum physics.</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.630" end="00:23:57.490" style="s2"> Quantum physics is ... you can think of quantum physics as such a box,</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.490" end="00:24:01.190" style="s2"> containing a box for Newtonian physics.</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.190" end="00:24:05.030" style="s2"> So quantum physics can explain anything that Newtonian physics can explain,</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.030" end="00:24:09.470" style="s2"> but besides that, it explains a number of other things. And you can say that it is therefore a better theory.</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.470" end="00:24:10.470" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:10.470" end="00:24:14.740" style="s2"> I can say, &quot;You have just gone through a personal transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.740" end="00:24:18.390" style="s2"> Are you a better person compared to before? ”And you may say,“ How would you</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.390" end="00:24:19.750" style="s2"> be able to judge something like that? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.750" end="00:24:23.570" style="s2"> I would say, &quot;If you have a better personality, you can do anything you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.570" end="00:24:27.490" style="s2"> before that it could, just as well, or maybe a little better, and there are a number of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.490" end="00:24:29.080" style="s2"> new things you can do.</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.080" end="00:24:31.110" style="s2"> That&#39;s a better personality. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.110" end="00:24:35.480" style="s2"> That&#39;s an interesting example of how the idea of ​​&quot;better,&quot; which is an ethical idea,</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.480" end="00:24:39.930" style="s2"> better versus worse ... you can conceptualize it. This is one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.930" end="00:24:44.710" style="s2"> which Piaget is very useful for, because he gives you a language,</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.710" end="00:24:49.420" style="s2"> anchored in observation and science, to approach questions bordering on the moral.</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.420" end="00:24:50.510" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:50.510" end="00:24:54.830" style="s2"> So a better personality can do more than the previous personality could, and you can certainly see</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.830" end="00:24:57.350" style="s2"> how that applies to your life.</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.350" end="00:25:03.690" style="s2"> On that basis, I would suggest ... people compare themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.690" end="00:25:07.370" style="s2"> always with other people. And what you generally do is compare yourself to ...</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.370" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2"> you create a small social hierarchy of the people around you.</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:15.100" style="s2"> That&#39;s a very irritating tendency, because it means no matter how successful you are</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.100" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2"> in your life, you are always at the center of the social hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:23.590" style="s2"> So you end up ... I know a lot ...</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.590" end="00:25:26.390" style="s2"> you might become a president of a company worth a hundred million dollars.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.390" end="00:25:30.510" style="s2"> Then you deal with a number of directors, and there are ten of them.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.510" end="00:25:32.840" style="s2"> Three of them are directors of a company worth two billion.</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.840" end="00:25:36.350" style="s2"> Compared to those people you are a small director. But who are you going with</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.350" end="00:25:38.020" style="s2"> compare yourself?</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.020" end="00:25:39.590" style="s2"> With the people who clean up your mess?</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.590" end="00:25:40.820" style="s2"> No.</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.820" end="00:25:44.680" style="s2"> You could, but you don&#39;t. You have a small group around you, and you are somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.680" end="00:25:45.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:25:45.680" end="00:25:50.440" style="s2"> That is useful to know, because it means that you have to learn to cope</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.440" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2"> with the fact that you are somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:56.910" style="s2"> And you might say, &quot;How do you deal with that? Cause you gotta get better,</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.910" end="00:25:58.930" style="s2"> and you have to be very good at something. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.930" end="00:26:03.330" style="s2"> I think the best way to do that, especially when you&#39;re older,</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.330" end="00:26:06.940" style="s2"> cannot be compared to other people by yourself. You compare yourself to the previous version of yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.940" end="00:26:07.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:26:07.940" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2"> That&#39;s a good way to check, because certainly by the time you&#39;re thirty ...</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:19.380" style="s2"> when you are young you have to compare yourself to other people because when you are young</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.380" end="00:26:23.400" style="s2"> you look a lot like all other young people. But by the time you&#39;re thirty or older,</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.400" end="00:26:25.890" style="s2"> you no longer resemble other people at all.</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.890" end="00:26:30.150" style="s2"> Because the circumstances of your life are starting to become so unique and specific.</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.150" end="00:26:31.529" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:26:31.529" end="00:26:34.910" style="s2"> Comparing yourself with others doesn&#39;t really help, but comparing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.910" end="00:26:39.150" style="s2"> Who you were with before, that is very helpful, and you can continue to do that throughout your life.</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.150" end="00:26:46.710" style="s2"> And it&#39;s fair game because the previous &quot;you&quot; had all the problems and all the chances</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.710" end="00:26:52.380" style="s2"> and positive qualities that you have.</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.380" end="00:26:59.010" style="s2"> It&#39;s fair game, and it will save you a lot of trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.010" end="00:27:09.320" style="s2"> Well, Piaget described different games, and he talked about different ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.320" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2"> on which they help in socialization.</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:16.810" style="s2"> I&#39;m using this &quot;meta-idea,&quot; the hierarchy of the personality,</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.810" end="00:27:19.080" style="s2"> to explain that.</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.080" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2"> From a Piagetian perspective you &quot;build yourself up&quot; from your body, towards more and more abstraction.</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:29.070" style="s2"> And while you do that, you can do more and more things with your body, but you can too</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.070" end="00:27:34.330" style="s2"> doing increasingly complex things, integrating the different things you do with your body over time,</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.330" end="00:27:36.450" style="s2"> and with more and more people.</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.450" end="00:27:42.980" style="s2"> Piaget has a very cool idea of ​​what constitutes morality, as a consequence of that.</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.980" end="00:27:43.980" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:43.980" end="00:27:49.390" style="s2"> Let&#39;s say you can choose game A or game B.</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.390" end="00:27:52.940" style="s2"> And you might say, &quot;I want to know which game is better, A or B.</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.940" end="00:27:56.060" style="s2"> Because if I&#39;m going to play a game, it better be a better game. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.060" end="00:28:00.610" style="s2"> And he would say, &quot;Well, this is how you can find out the game you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.610" end="00:28:04.860" style="s2"> is a good game. It&#39;s good for you.</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.860" end="00:28:05.990" style="s2"> Now.</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.990" end="00:28:12.060" style="s2"> It&#39;s good for you now, next week, next month, next year, and ten years from now.</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.060" end="00:28:16.410" style="s2"> So not only is it good for you now, but if you play it repeatedly, things get better for you. ”</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.410" end="00:28:17.410" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:28:17.410" end="00:28:20.310" style="s2"> That is a game in which you take the future into account.</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.310" end="00:28:22.180" style="s2"> It&#39;s not an impulsive game.</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.180" end="00:28:28.710" style="s2"> Cocaine is very good for people, for a day, but for a week,</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.710" end="00:28:31.850" style="s2"> or six months, or five years, it is a game that weakens.</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.850" end="00:28:37.800" style="s2"> And you can&#39;t use your gut to determine that, because cocaine is fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.800" end="00:28:41.780" style="s2"> the person using it usually with a sense of strength and potential.</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.780" end="00:28:46.360" style="s2"> So you cannot rely on your gut, no more than when you are tempted</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.360" end="00:28:49.800" style="s2"> to do something that is impulsive and fun, but that can have negative consequences.</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.800" end="00:28:54.860" style="s2"> So the game must be good now, and in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.860" end="00:28:57.250" style="s2"> Then it must be good for you, and for your family,</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.250" end="00:29:02.590" style="s2"> and for your social community, et cetera, in a concentric movement.</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.590" end="00:29:07.500" style="s2"> And it has to be good for all of those things over long periods of time.</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.500" end="00:29:10.210" style="s2"> Piaget called that a &quot;balanced game.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.210" end="00:29:16.010" style="s2"> There is another idea behind the idea of ​​a balanced game, namely that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.010" end="00:29:21.350" style="s2"> if I play a game that&#39;s good for me, and good for you, and for you, and for you,</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.350" end="00:29:25.280" style="s2"> then we&#39;ll all probably be willing to play it</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.280" end="00:29:27.110" style="s2"> voluntarily.</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.110" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2"> That&#39;s also why Piaget believed that a game structure, such as a social structure ...</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:37.250" style="s2"> that if everyone plays because they want to, is much better than a game structure</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.250" end="00:29:40.130" style="s2"> in which everyone plays because they have to.</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.130" end="00:29:44.420" style="s2"> He would say that&#39;s partly the technical difference between a dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.420" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2"> and a democracy.</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:48.350" style="s2"> That is very intelligent.</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.350" end="00:29:52.450" style="s2"> I think Piaget got further with that idea than anyone else in history.</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.450" end="00:29:54.710" style="s2"> Because you can understand ... there is an old idea ...</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.710" end="00:29:56.950" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:29:56.950" end="00:29:59.620" style="s2"> Van Hume, another philosopher.</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.620" end="00:30:00.620" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:30:00.620" end="00:30:01.620" style="s2"> What is his first name?</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.620" end="00:30:02.620" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:30:02.620" end="00:30:03.620" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:30:03.620" end="00:30:04.620" style="s2"> What?</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.620" end="00:30:08.310" style="s2"> David. Yes, you would think I could remember that.</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.310" end="00:30:09.650" style="s2"> David Hume.</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.650" end="00:30:13.570" style="s2"> He feels that you cannot derive an &quot;imperative&quot; from an &quot;indicative.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.570" end="00:30:17.820" style="s2"> That&#39;s another such principle, like Ockham&#39;s razor, and it means</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.820" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2"> something like, no matter how much you know about something, that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:25.080" style="s2"> you know what to do with it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.080" end="00:30:30.430" style="s2"> An example. Let&#39;s say we know AIDS is a problem, cancer is a problem,</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.430" end="00:30:34.090" style="s2"> that heart disease is a problem, that poverty is a problem,</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.090" end="00:30:37.770" style="s2"> etcetera. There are all kinds of problems.</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.770" end="00:30:42.680" style="s2"> How do you determine how to distribute resources for those different problems?</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.680" end="00:30:47.130" style="s2"> That&#39;s a difficult problem to approach scientifically,</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.130" end="00:30:50.650" style="s2"> and that&#39;s because there are many variables to weigh.</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.650" end="00:30:51.650" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:30:51.650" end="00:30:55.380" style="s2"> Imagine you are making a table and you think, &quot;Okay, what&#39;s the most problematic,</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.380" end="00:31:00.120" style="s2"> that we can solve with the smallest amount of money? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.120" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:06.300" style="s2"> The problem with determining if something is problematic is still you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.300" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2"> must make a value judgment.</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:11.630" style="s2"> You cannot possibly get to the root of the problem without the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.630" end="00:31:15.910" style="s2"> of value judgments. And that is why it is very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.910" end="00:31:19.750" style="s2"> determine an imperative (what to do), based on an indicative (what you know).</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.750" end="00:31:23.580" style="s2"> And therefore there is a distinction between science and morality, or science and religion,</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.580" end="00:31:27.900" style="s2"> that&#39;s another way of seeing it. They are different domains.</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.900" end="00:31:35.230" style="s2"> Piaget has, in a sense, described a solution to that, because he says:</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.230" end="00:31:38.980" style="s2"> &quot;See, a theory is better than a previous one, if the theory explains the same thing,</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.980" end="00:31:42.970" style="s2"> and more. &quot;And you can apply that to your personality. And a game that is better than</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.970" end="00:31:49.050" style="s2"> another game, is a game that you and other people benefit from, during</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.050" end="00:31:51.470" style="s2"> longer periods.</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.470" end="00:31:53.350" style="s2"> Such a game is difficult to calculate.</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.350" end="00:31:57.940" style="s2"> When people talk about the environment and sustainability, they are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.940" end="00:32:03.530" style="s2"> about a Piagetian balanced game. Where you can live in your family, and your family</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.530" end="00:32:08.570" style="s2"> in a society, and society can function within an economy, and the economy can exist within</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.570" end="00:32:14.350" style="s2"> an ecology, without the economy unbalancing the ecology. That you couldn&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.350" end="00:32:20.120" style="s2"> and your family wouldn&#39;t, and society wouldn&#39;t function, and the economy wouldn&#39;t function.</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.120" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:26.790" style="s2"> So there is this idea of ​​a layered equilibrium, but such things are very difficult to calculate.</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.790" end="00:32:27.790" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:32:27.790" end="00:32:29.350" style="s2"> But it is a nice principle.</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.350" end="00:32:33.520" style="s2"> So if you think ... if you need a justification for doing what</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.520" end="00:32:37.450" style="s2"> and you want to have a solid moral foundation, which is very useful,</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.450" end="00:32:41.740" style="s2"> because then people can&#39;t knock you over, verbally, intellectually, or whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.740" end="00:32:44.850" style="s2"> Because you are anchored, you are on solid ground.</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.850" end="00:32:48.580" style="s2"> You should know: why is this good for you, if you were to take good care of yourself?</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.580" end="00:32:49.660" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:32:49.660" end="00:32:52.460" style="s2"> Why is it good for you over a longer period of time?</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.460" end="00:32:54.380" style="s2"> How will your family benefit?</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.380" end="00:32:55.770" style="s2"> How does society benefit?</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.770" end="00:32:58.380" style="s2"> And from there you can keep going up.</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.380" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2"> I can give you an example of someone who does that, in my opinion.</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:07.090" style="s2"> Do you know that Dutch guy who invented how to get plastic out of the ocean?</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.090" end="00:33:11.930" style="s2"> He is not complaining about it, and is not parading with a sign that says:</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.930" end="00:33:13.500" style="s2"> &quot;I don&#39;t like pollution.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.500" end="00:33:17.380" style="s2"> As if you had to tell people that, because nobody likes ...</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.380" end="00:33:19.710" style="s2"> &quot;I don&#39;t like pollution and I am against poverty.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.710" end="00:33:25.050" style="s2"> Yes ... try to find someone who is for pollution and poverty.</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.050" end="00:33:30.020" style="s2"> This boy was seventeen, something like that, and he was diving.</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.020" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2"> He is a diver.</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:35.780" style="s2"> I think he was spearfishing, and he noticed there was more plastic than fish.</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.780" end="00:33:38.850" style="s2"> And that was not a happy discovery for him.</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.850" end="00:33:42.510" style="s2"> He started to think about it, &quot;How can we get the plastic out of the ocean?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.510" end="00:33:46.900" style="s2"> Later he was looking at manta rays, and manta rays have large wings with which</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.900" end="00:33:48.490" style="s2"> they float through the sea.</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.490" end="00:33:51.150" style="s2"> And he thought about that for a while, and then he thought, &quot;Maybe I can build something</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:56.750" style="s2"> what looks like a giant manta, which lies on the surface of the ocean like a triangle,</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.750" end="00:34:02.250" style="s2"> and can be towed through the ocean so that all the plastic gets into the tip of the triangle.</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.250" end="00:34:04.140" style="s2"> And then you can just brag it. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.140" end="00:34:08.300" style="s2"> But then he calculated it ... I don&#39;t know the story exactly, but this is about it.</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.300" end="00:34:11.749" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:34:11.749" end="00:34:15.349" style="s2"> He made some calculations and found that it wouldn&#39;t be effective.</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.349" end="00:34:19.129" style="s2"> because it takes a lot of energy to pull that thing through the water, and there is a lot of water.</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.129" end="00:34:22.529" style="s2"> And you produce a lot of pollution if you pull that thing through the water.</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.529" end="00:34:23.529" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:34:23.529" end="00:34:25.049" style="s2"> So that probably won&#39;t help.</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.049" end="00:34:28.829" style="s2"> But then he realized that when you go far out into the ocean, there are big ring-shaped ones</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.829" end="00:34:35.169" style="s2"> sea ​​currents are like big hurricanes of water that move very slowly.</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.169" end="00:34:36.330" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:34:36.330" end="00:34:38.149" style="s2"> But they are huge, they are the size of a continent.</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.149" end="00:34:42.300" style="s2"> The oceans have always been in motion, so he thought, &quot;Aha!</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.300" end="00:34:47.319" style="s2"> As the ocean moves, so does the plastic collector</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.319" end="00:34:49.490" style="s2"> not to be dragged through the water.</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.490" end="00:34:54.999" style="s2"> You can attach it to the bottom of the ocean with cables, and it just stays there.</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.999" end="00:34:56.809" style="s2"> And then the ocean will pass through by itself. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.809" end="00:35:02.030" style="s2"> So he built a prototype, not too big, and he collected quite a bit of plastic.</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.030" end="00:35:05.990" style="s2"> All the plastic is in the top thirty centimeters, by the way, and the density increases</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.990" end="00:35:09.349" style="s2"> as you get closer to the top inches.</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.349" end="00:35:14.150" style="s2"> Then he built a bigger one, and subscribed to &quot;Kickstarter&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.150" end="00:35:15.150" style="s2"> and raised so much money.</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.150" end="00:35:18.420" style="s2"> Then he had a number of engineers evaluate his idea, and they said:</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.420" end="00:35:19.420" style="s2"> &quot;This probably works.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.420" end="00:35:23.480" style="s2"> So then they built a larger specimen several kilometers long, which has now been placed</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.480" end="00:35:25.160" style="s2"> off the coast of Japan.</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.160" end="00:35:30.569" style="s2"> They also sent a whole fleet of people from California to Hawaii for an estimate</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.569" end="00:35:34.170" style="s2"> to make up the amount of waste in the water. Because there is a big place</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.170" end="00:35:38.220" style="s2"> in the middle of the Pacific called the &quot;floating garbage dump,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.220" end="00:35:39.480" style="s2"> or the &quot;plastic soup&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.480" end="00:35:42.049" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t matter ... it&#39;s full of plastic.</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.049" end="00:35:44.420" style="s2"> They went to estimate how much was there.</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.420" end="00:35:48.980" style="s2"> Anyway, he thinks he can fix that thing in the bottom of the ocean, in those great ocean currents,</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.980" end="00:35:56.759" style="s2"> can make it a hundred kilometers in size, in a V-shape, with a collection point at the end,</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.759" end="00:36:02.609" style="s2"> load all the plastic he collects onto towing vessels and refine it into oil or plastic,</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.609" end="00:36:05.210" style="s2"> and pay for it while he does it.</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.210" end="00:36:09.539" style="s2"> You can visit him, I think he&#39;s nineteen or twenty now.</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.539" end="00:36:12.619" style="s2"> That&#39;s a well-balanced game, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.619" end="00:36:13.640" style="s2"> That works well.</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:18.210" style="s2"> He makes some money, good for him. He can hire a number of people, that&#39;s good.</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.210" end="00:36:21.600" style="s2"> Everyone is happy with it, because we come from</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.600" end="00:36:24.789" style="s2"> the waste. And it has no downside.</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.789" end="00:36:29.650" style="s2"> It&#39;s hard to argue why</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.650" end="00:36:32.089" style="s2"> wouldn&#39;t be right.</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.089" end="00:36:35.809" style="s2"> And it is good because it benefits everyone, including at the higher levels.</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.809" end="00:36:38.460" style="s2"> So that&#39;s a balanced state.</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.460" end="00:36:43.589" style="s2"> It&#39;s a very intelligent idea.</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.589" end="00:36:51.049" style="s2"> Good, Jung.</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.049" end="00:36:57.619" style="s2"> Experimental psychologists don&#39;t like Jung ... they don&#39;t like Freud either,</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.619" end="00:37:00.730" style="s2"> they generally have little time for clinicians.</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.730" end="00:37:07.039" style="s2"> But that doesn&#39;t matter, they don&#39;t try to solve the same problems.</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.039" end="00:37:13.589" style="s2"> Usually when you take classes in &quot;personality theory&quot;, you treat Freud before you treat Jung.</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.589" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2"> That&#39;s because Freud preceded Jung in a number of ways, historically,</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:25.250" style="s2"> and many people, especially the Freudians, like to see Jung as a student of Freud.</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.250" end="00:37:30.049" style="s2"> There is something in it, because Freud was the first person to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.049" end="00:37:36.259" style="s2"> collected ideas about the unconscious, and conceptualized, published, and applied them to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.259" end="00:37:40.099" style="s2"> the problems of pathology and mental health.</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.099" end="00:37:42.039" style="s2"> Chapeau.</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.039" end="00:37:52.369" style="s2"> And Freud was unsurpassed in describing pathological families, and there are plenty of them.</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.369" end="00:37:55.270" style="s2"> But Jung was interested in something underneath.</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.270" end="00:37:57.230" style="s2"> Freud already had a great eye for what lies on the surface.</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.230" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2"> He was one of the first to point out the strength of sexual and aggressive motives</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:07.109" style="s2"> in shaping the way we think.</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.109" end="00:38:16.029" style="s2"> But Jung was more interested in ... in a way, Jung was more like a Darwinian biologist.</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.029" end="00:38:17.190" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:17.190" end="00:38:26.499" style="s2"> He was more interested in biological and psychological philosophical history</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.499" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2"> of basic human behavioral patterns.</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2"> Jung was not like a behaviorist.</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:38.259" style="s2"> A behaviorist thinks that when you are born, there is nothing beyond the ability</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.259" end="00:38:40.329" style="s2"> to learn things, you are a blank slate.</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.329" end="00:38:44.170" style="s2"> And everything you learn is a result of sensory information you receive,</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.170" end="00:38:48.359" style="s2"> and what you learn from it.</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.359" end="00:38:51.579" style="s2"> But Jung thought completely different.</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.579" end="00:38:58.990" style="s2"> He thought there is a specific human nature, and he tried to understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.990" end="00:39:00.430" style="s2"> what that human nature is.</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.430" end="00:39:06.410" style="s2"> A few lectures ago I talked about the possible elements from which</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.410" end="00:39:08.650" style="s2"> the world in which you live exists.</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.650" end="00:39:14.280" style="s2"> You can distinguish the &quot;completely unknown&quot;. The unknown that is so unknown</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.280" end="00:39:17.020" style="s2"> that you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s there.</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.020" end="00:39:21.450" style="s2"> That is something very shocking if you ever come across it.</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.450" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2"> That&#39;s what you&#39;re exposed to, hypothetically, when you go to a horror movie that revolves around fear.</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.660" end="00:39:27.660" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:39:27.660" end="00:39:32.749" style="s2"> Because horror movies that use fear confront you with things that don&#39;t behave</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.749" end="00:39:37.020" style="s2"> as they should behave, like inanimate objects moving.</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.020" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2"> If you suddenly discover an inanimate object moving,</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:44.119" style="s2"> there is a lot wrong with your current model of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.119" end="00:39:47.550" style="s2"> You can experience that somewhat in a horror film, because objects do things,</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.550" end="00:39:49.410" style="s2"> they shouldn&#39;t do, like walls that bleed.</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.410" end="00:39:53.420" style="s2"> That&#39;s not supposed to happen, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s disturbing to see something like this.</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.420" end="00:39:54.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:39:54.420" end="00:39:59.240" style="s2"> But you expose yourself to that with horror movies to ...</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.240" end="00:40:03.950" style="s2"> you try to develop some courage, because who knows which of your basic assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.950" end="00:40:10.910" style="s2"> will not turn out to be correct.</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.910" end="00:40:15.349" style="s2"> So we were talking about representations of the completely unknown, and I indicated that those</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.349" end="00:40:21.260" style="s2"> often associated with snake-like predators. And then we talked about representations of culture,</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.260" end="00:40:27.059" style="s2"> because every character has to deal with the culture, be it a fictional character,</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.059" end="00:40:28.059" style="s2"> or you yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.059" end="00:40:29.059" style="s2"> You&#39;re stuck with it.</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.059" end="00:40:33.470" style="s2"> You have your culture, and that&#39;s partly positive. &#39;Cause here you are you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.470" end="00:40:37.509" style="s2"> you can read, it is warm, a bright future awaits you.</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.509" end="00:40:42.869" style="s2"> But it is also a destructive tyrant because it is ruining the world and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.869" end="00:40:44.609" style="s2"> that you already know.</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.609" end="00:40:48.150" style="s2"> That&#39;s culture, and then there&#39;s nature. Because you are also stuck with that.</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.150" end="00:40:53.800" style="s2"> And there is a benign element of nature, which is usually represented by feminine symbols,</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.800" end="00:40:57.770" style="s2"> and that is &quot;Mother Nature&quot; that the environmentalists know and love.</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.770" end="00:41:03.730" style="s2"> And there&#39;s Mother Nature giving your mom cancer when she&#39;s forty, and that&#39;s the downside</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.730" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2"> Mother Nature, and you&#39;re stuck with that too.</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.470" style="s2"> And you are there, with all your useful aspects,</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.470" end="00:41:10.920" style="s2"> your heroic aspects.</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.920" end="00:41:15.630" style="s2"> Technically speaking. The aspects of you that are able to confront the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.630" end="00:41:19.410" style="s2"> and overcome, or face the tyrannical part of the culture and overcome.</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.410" end="00:41:23.989" style="s2"> That&#39;s the positive part, and there&#39;s the negative part, that part of you</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.989" end="00:41:27.299" style="s2"> that you know very well, that always causes problems for yourself and others.</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.299" end="00:41:31.799" style="s2"> That doesn&#39;t do what it should, and is spiteful, and angry, petty, mean,</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.799" end="00:41:38.319" style="s2"> ignorant, blind, impulsive, that rationalizes, and all that fine stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.319" end="00:41:40.259" style="s2"> what people are capable of.</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.259" end="00:41:42.670" style="s2"> These are all archetypes.</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.670" end="00:41:49.759" style="s2"> They are archetypes because they are the basic personalities that we use</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.759" end="00:41:51.299" style="s2"> to orient ourselves in life.</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.299" end="00:41:53.950" style="s2"> I think that&#39;s the best way to see it.</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.950" end="00:41:57.640" style="s2"> When Jung talked about an archetype, it&#39;s complicated because sometimes he talked about them</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.640" end="00:42:01.809" style="s2"> as instincts, sometimes as images, and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.809" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2"> like stories.</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.160" style="s2"> But the best way to deal with that is to understand that they all do</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.160" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2"> at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:12.950" style="s2"> For example, if you go to a romantic story, which is some kind of archetypal story,</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.950" end="00:42:19.029" style="s2"> you go to a romantic comedy, that means the main characters get into a love affair,</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.029" end="00:42:20.950" style="s2"> and it ends positively.</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.950" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2"> Romantic Comedy: An Archetypal Structure.</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:25.630" style="s2"> What are the characters doing?</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.630" end="00:42:30.789" style="s2"> They are driven by their instinct, of course, which is the instinctual level of the archetype.</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.789" end="00:42:35.140" style="s2"> Then it is a pattern of behavior, because they interact with each other.</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.140" end="00:42:41.660" style="s2"> And it&#39;s a story because someone has selected the main elements of the events,</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.660" end="00:42:45.089" style="s2"> in the way that would be most engaging to an audience, and displayed it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.089" end="00:42:47.819" style="s2"> So the archetype can be all of those things at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.819" end="00:42:51.539" style="s2"> That is not contradictory, it just means that it is a very complex phenomenon.</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.539" end="00:42:54.700" style="s2"> You can see it best as a personality.</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.700" end="00:42:58.950" style="s2"> An archetype is a personality, and an archetypal story is the way one</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.950" end="00:43:02.559" style="s2"> archetypal personality manifests itself over time.</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.559" end="00:43:07.130" style="s2"> And there are many archetypal stories, I can give you some basic examples.</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.130" end="00:43:08.130" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:43:08.130" end="00:43:13.690" style="s2"> The basic archetype for masculine behavior is the story of the dragon, confronting the dragon.</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.690" end="00:43:18.109" style="s2"> Going out, confronting the dragon, which could be anything.</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.109" end="00:43:23.489" style="s2"> It could be the completely unknown, it could be the negative element of the feminine, that&#39;s a dragon that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.489" end="00:43:30.029" style="s2"> men are constantly paralyzed, and what usually happens as a result, is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.029" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2"> the person gets a treasure, or a girl.</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.829" style="s2"> The basic feminine archetype, insofar as I&#39;ve been able to discover it ...</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.829" end="00:43:41.480" style="s2"> it&#39;s a bit harder to figure out, it took me a long time ... is &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.480" end="00:43:45.509" style="s2"> I found out ... for several reasons, but I only got there</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.509" end="00:43:47.989" style="s2"> two years ago, and I thought, &quot;Of course, that&#39;s it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.989" end="00:43:55.079" style="s2"> I read a book by the people who did data analysis for Google, and it&#39;s called &quot;A Billion Wicked Thoughts.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.079" end="00:43:56.210" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:43:56.210" end="00:44:00.470" style="s2"> It&#39;s a pretty interesting book, and what it basically is is an investigation into the use of the search engine.</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.470" end="00:44:01.470" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:01.470" end="00:44:07.779" style="s2"> I think 18-19 percent of search engine use is sexual in nature.</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.779" end="00:44:10.430" style="s2"> And then you think, &quot;What do men do, and what do women do?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.430" end="00:44:14.759" style="s2"> We know what men do, they look at pictures of naked women, generally.</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.759" end="00:44:15.759" style="s2"> What do women do?</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.759" end="00:44:16.769" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:16.769" end="00:44:17.769" style="s2"> Ah!</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.769" end="00:44:23.380" style="s2"> They don&#39;t look at pictures of naked men, they read about sex.</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.380" end="00:44:25.779" style="s2"> So pornography for women is literary.</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.779" end="00:44:28.809" style="s2"> So I thought, &quot;That&#39;s interesting.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.809" end="00:44:32.089" style="s2"> That makes sense, because women read more fiction than men.</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.089" end="00:44:33.799" style="s2"> Women are more likely to read fiction.</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.799" end="00:44:38.730" style="s2"> Women seem to be more interested in people than things, a gender difference that is not culture-bound.</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.730" end="00:44:39.819" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:39.819" end="00:44:43.529" style="s2"> So women read about sex.</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.529" end="00:44:48.299" style="s2"> You know that when you ... when you look at ... when I was on summer vacation as a kid,</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.299" end="00:44:51.640" style="s2"> my mother always took about thirty doctor novels with her.</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.640" end="00:44:54.380" style="s2"> Do you know what a doctor&#39;s novel is?</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.380" end="00:44:56.890" style="s2"> Does anyone know what a doctor&#39;s novel is?</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.890" end="00:44:58.690" style="s2"> Does anyone not know?</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.690" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2"> Okay, most people know?</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:03.819" style="s2"> It&#39;s a cheap romantic story.</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.819" end="00:45:10.369" style="s2"> A sympathetic young woman meets a flashy, but somewhat distant man. And he&#39;s already got someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.369" end="00:45:14.579" style="s2"> but she doesn&#39;t deserve it. And then she seduces him</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.579" end="00:45:18.999" style="s2"> and he decides she&#39;s actually the one. And then she gets it</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.999" end="00:45:21.789" style="s2"> and everyone lives happily ever after.</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.789" end="00:45:23.390" style="s2"> That&#39;s a doctor&#39;s fiction.</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.390" end="00:45:28.349" style="s2"> The original doctor&#39;s novel, millions of it published,</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.349" end="00:45:33.529" style="s2"> went like this, it was a pretty flat, third-rate story.</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.529" end="00:45:39.170" style="s2"> But since the 1970s, the doctor&#39;s novel has exploded, and of a third-rate story</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.170" end="00:45:42.260" style="s2"> as I told you, turned into very pornographic versions of it.</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.260" end="00:45:48.950" style="s2"> They are very popular, and stories like that are also characteristic of female internet use.</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.950" end="00:45:49.950" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:49.950" end="00:45:54.170" style="s2"> You see they look up &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; stories, and there are five main protagonists.</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.170" end="00:45:57.329" style="s2"> And I find this so terribly comical,</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.329" end="00:45:58.619" style="s2"> I was double when I first read it.</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.619" end="00:46:07.079" style="s2"> These are the five main men in female heavy pornography: werewolf, vampire,</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.079" end="00:46:12.069" style="s2"> surgeon, millionaire,</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.069" end="00:46:15.569" style="s2"> pirate.</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.569" end="00:46:21.509" style="s2"> Isn&#39;t that entertaining? I was double. It&#39;s not much different in a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.509" end="00:46:25.249" style="s2"> the masculine archetypal story of the confrontation with the dragon.</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.249" end="00:46:28.759" style="s2"> I&#39;m going to show you something from Sleeping Beauty, which makes that very clear.</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.759" end="00:46:30.809" style="s2"> I&#39;ll show you that today.</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.809" end="00:46:34.710" style="s2"> Because when you think about it, these are actually kind of bad guys.</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.710" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2"> The werewolf and the vampire in particular, but the pirate is actually one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2"> And you may ask, &quot;Why would such men have that role in feminine archetypal sexual narratives?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2"> And the answer is: what good is a man</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:49.239" style="s2"> which cannot be dangerous?</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.239" end="00:46:50.239" style="s2"> Think about that.</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.239" end="00:46:53.660" style="s2"> This theme is constantly portrayed in romantic comedies.</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.660" end="00:46:54.660" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:54.660" end="00:46:55.950" style="s2"> There is a girl and she has a boyfriend.</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.950" end="00:46:56.950" style="s2"> A young man.</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.950" end="00:46:59.190" style="s2"> He&#39;s the kind of boy who never grew up.</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.190" end="00:47:00.190" style="s2"> Usually he&#39;s ...</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.190" end="00:47:02.259" style="s2"> What is his name? A comedian ...</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.259" end="00:47:04.349" style="s2"> Seth Rogen. Usually he&#39;s some sort of Seth Rogen.</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.349" end="00:47:09.410" style="s2"> And he&#39;s jovial, and funny, and her friend,</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.410" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2"> but actually he wants to sleep with her, and she knows it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:15.420" style="s2"> She knows he&#39;s not just a friend, and he&#39;s not just a friend, he&#39;s pretending.</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.420" end="00:47:16.599" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:47:16.599" end="00:47:20.829" style="s2"> And then there&#39;s the guy she&#39;s interested in who doesn&#39;t look like Seth Rogen,</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.829" end="00:47:23.099" style="s2"> and which has a raw edge.</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.099" end="00:47:27.569" style="s2"> And the story usually unfolds ... there is a development taking place between those three characters.</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.569" end="00:47:30.380" style="s2"> And the &quot;Seth Rogen&quot; character always says, &quot;Why doesn&#39;t she like me?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.380" end="00:47:31.380" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:47:31.380" end="00:47:35.369" style="s2"> And the answer is: you only have to look at him for ten minutes and you know why.</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.369" end="00:47:38.680" style="s2"> Partly because she doesn&#39;t want a boyfriend.</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.680" end="00:47:42.040" style="s2"> She wants someone who is good for something and someone who is good for something</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.040" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2"> is someone with a raw edge.</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:50.890" style="s2"> And what happens in the feminine archetype is that the woman civilizes that,</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.890" end="00:47:52.529" style="s2"> at least in relation to itself.</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.529" end="00:48:00.619" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very different from the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.619" end="00:48:02.900" style="s2"> male hero myth.</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.900" end="00:48:09.339" style="s2"> I&#39;m going to show you something from Sleeping Beauty first.</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.339" end="00:48:10.339" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:48:10.339" end="00:48:22.630" style="s2"> Have a look.</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.630" end="00:48:30.099" style="s2"> What is the universal &quot;video player&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.099" end="00:48:32.470" style="s2"> Yes that one.</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.470" end="00:48:33.470" style="s2"> Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.470" end="00:48:39.029" style="s2"> I have to download it because they clean this machine every night.</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.029" end="00:48:54.339" style="s2"> So you have to download things over and over again.</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.339" end="00:49:04.740" style="s2"> Okay, let&#39;s talk about Sleeping Beauty&#39;s structure for a moment.</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.740" end="00:49:13.990" style="s2"> There&#39;s a king, and a queen, and they live in a kingdom, logically.</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.990" end="00:49:17.789" style="s2"> They are trying to have a child, but that does not really work.</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.789" end="00:49:21.509" style="s2"> After a while they suddenly have a girl</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.509" end="00:49:23.319" style="s2"> called Aurora.</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.319" end="00:49:27.349" style="s2"> That&#39;s a reference to the sky.</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.349" end="00:49:32.269" style="s2"> You often see that archetypal figures are associated with</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.269" end="00:49:33.690" style="s2"> cosmic phenomena.</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.690" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2"> For example, kings and queens have a crown.</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:43.229" style="s2"> And divine figures have halos.</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.229" end="00:49:50.470" style="s2"> There is not much difference between a crown and a halo, and the crown is the sun.</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.470" end="00:49:53.190" style="s2"> The little dots on it are the rays of the sun.</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.190" end="00:49:54.190" style="s2"> Or it&#39;s the moon.</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.190" end="00:49:58.369" style="s2"> It depends on whether the crown is made of gold or silver, because gold is a solar metal</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.369" end="00:50:01.000" style="s2"> and silver is lunar metal.</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.000" end="00:50:06.420" style="s2"> So if something is connected to the cosmos, that means it has changed</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.420" end="00:50:12.680" style="s2"> from the purely personal, to the impersonal, or transpersonal, or archetypal.</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.680" end="00:50:18.660" style="s2"> The archetypal would not be your father, but the Father as such, the spirit of the Father.</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.660" end="00:50:21.569" style="s2"> Not your mother, but the mind of the Mother as such.</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.569" end="00:50:25.109" style="s2"> If you have the king and queen, you have the sun and the moon.</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.109" end="00:50:27.829" style="s2"> You have the prince of the sky of the day, and the prince of the sky of the night.</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.829" end="00:50:33.529" style="s2"> You have the frost of all that touches the light, and you have the transpersonal figures</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.529" end="00:50:34.900" style="s2"> from Mother and Father.</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.900" end="00:50:42.819" style="s2"> You see this in many movies, hero stories, and comic books.</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.819" end="00:50:50.259" style="s2"> The most common pattern portrayed is that the hero has two pairs of parents.</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.259" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2"> Harry Potter has the Dursley family, where he has to live under the stairs,</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:50:58.190" style="s2"> and he has his brother ...</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.190" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2"> &quot;cousin.&quot; What is his name?</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:01.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:01.160" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2"> What?</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:03.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:03.160" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2"> Dudley!</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:07.700" style="s2"> Yes, the long version of &quot;dud.&quot; (blank)</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.700" end="00:51:14.200" style="s2"> And he&#39;s a bad brother, they are the archetypal enemy brothers.</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.200" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:16.200" style="s2"> Harry Potter.</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.200" end="00:51:17.479" style="s2"> Hero and opponent.</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.479" end="00:51:22.050" style="s2"> And he has his common parents, and those are the very common parents.</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.050" end="00:51:25.009" style="s2"> They live in an English suburb, and they are very conservative</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.009" end="00:51:26.009" style="s2"> and narrow-minded.</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.009" end="00:51:28.299" style="s2"> They don&#39;t want anything to do with magic.</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.299" end="00:51:31.720" style="s2"> In addition, he has his heavenly parents, his magical parents.</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.720" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2"> And they occasionally appear as a ghost, over the course of the movie, when he really needs them.</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:37.010" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:37.010" end="00:51:42.470" style="s2"> Superman, he has his earthly parents and his heavenly parents.</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.470" end="00:51:48.829" style="s2"> If you look up &quot;be hero&quot; on Wikipedia, I think you have about a hundred and sixty</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.829" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2"> listed, the same motif, over and over again.</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.440" style="s2"> The reason for that is ... first, if you&#39;re a teenager, you think:</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.440" end="00:52:00.150" style="s2"> &quot;Are these really my parents?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.150" end="00:52:04.730" style="s2"> And the answer is yes and no.</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.730" end="00:52:13.069" style="s2"> Yes, because they are from a strict, direct biological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.069" end="00:52:15.609" style="s2"> are your parents.</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.609" end="00:52:23.400" style="s2"> But from an archetypal perspective, you have parents to</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.400" end="00:52:26.009" style="s2"> 3.5 billion ago.</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.009" end="00:52:30.739" style="s2"> Your parents were only the last in a very long line of parents.</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.739" end="00:52:34.200" style="s2"> The reason you call your daddy &quot;daddy&quot; or &quot;daddy,&quot; or whatever you call him,</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.200" end="00:52:40.400" style="s2"> is because of the recognition that the relationship you have with him,</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.400" end="00:52:43.349" style="s2"> in a sense is not personal, but archetypal.</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.349" end="00:52:44.349" style="s2"> He is the Father.</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.349" end="00:52:47.010" style="s2"> He has that role for you.</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.010" end="00:52:51.509" style="s2"> And you can even know when he plays that role well, because you tell</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.509" end="00:52:55.279" style="s2"> your friends maybe, &quot;I don&#39;t have a good father.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.279" end="00:52:57.400" style="s2"> How do you know that?</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.400" end="00:53:00.380" style="s2"> You have an idea of ​​what a good dad would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.380" end="00:53:04.819" style="s2"> and if he doesn&#39;t, he isn&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.819" end="00:53:06.769" style="s2"> Your childish and adolescent misinterpretations aside.</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.769" end="00:53:08.980" style="s2"> &quot;I have a terrible mother.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.980" end="00:53:10.539" style="s2"> Compared to what?</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.539" end="00:53:12.099" style="s2"> &quot;Compared to the ideal mother.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.099" end="00:53:15.200" style="s2"> You may ask, &quot;Who is that ideal mother?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.200" end="00:53:18.279" style="s2"> You see it incessantly in religious representations.</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.279" end="00:53:21.930" style="s2"> For example, in Christianity, she is represented as the Virgin Mary,</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.930" end="00:53:22.979" style="s2"> the perfect mother.</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.979" end="00:53:25.329" style="s2"> That is why she is a holy figure.</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.329" end="00:53:29.589" style="s2"> She is a holy figure, an archetypal figure, as every society</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.589" end="00:53:33.559" style="s2"> that does not worship the mother and child disappears.</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.559" end="00:53:40.140" style="s2"> It must be sacred, because everyone starts ... everyone has that relationship. And as society</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.140" end="00:53:43.599" style="s2"> that doesn&#39;t support and appreciate well, then there is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.599" end="00:53:47.569" style="s2"> seriously wrong with society.</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.569" end="00:53:50.859" style="s2"> All right, Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.859" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2"> King and queen.</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:53.000" style="s2"> Child.</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.000" end="00:53:58.089" style="s2"> So we have the triad of the family.</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.089" end="00:54:00.509" style="s2"> Then they decide to baptize her, they&#39;re going to give her a name,</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.509" end="00:54:02.259" style="s2"> and that is when she becomes an individual.</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.259" end="00:54:04.930" style="s2"> And they make a mistake when they baptize her.</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.930" end="00:54:05.930" style="s2"> What&#39;s the mistake?</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.930" end="00:54:06.930" style="s2"> Do you still remember?</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.930" end="00:54:08.500" style="s2"> How many of you have seen Sleeping Beauty?</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.500" end="00:54:11.910" style="s2"> Okay, and how much not?</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.910" end="00:54:17.799" style="s2"> Well, from those who haven&#39;t seen it, have you seen any other Disney movies?</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.799" end="00:54:19.609" style="s2"> Have you seen any other Disney movies?</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.609" end="00:54:20.609" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:54:20.609" end="00:54:21.609" style="s2"> The lionking.</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.609" end="00:54:23.099" style="s2"> Good, and other?</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.099" end="00:54:24.099" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:54:24.099" end="00:54:28.150" style="s2"> Is there anyone here who has never seen a Disney cartoon?</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.150" end="00:54:30.599" style="s2"> Good.</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.599" end="00:54:34.989" style="s2"> You see how much there was no one as far as I could see</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.989" end="00:54:40.309" style="s2"> how much those stories are spread in the culture, even if they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.309" end="00:54:44.359" style="s2"> very old stories. Even in film form, they are quite old.</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.359" end="00:54:48.249" style="s2"> The mistake they make is they don&#39;t invite the evil queen to baptism.</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.249" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2"> And that is Maleficent.</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:54.999" style="s2"> That clearly has a satanic undertone, and you know it, because</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.999" end="00:54:59.309" style="s2"> she wears black horns, and she has a cloak that is on fire.</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.309" end="00:55:00.309" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:55:00.309" end="00:55:03.319" style="s2"> You can tell she is an evil person.</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.319" end="00:55:07.750" style="s2"> She is an archetype. She is the archetype of the negative feminine.</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.750" end="00:55:09.750" style="s2"> It&#39;s a very thoughtful story.</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.750" end="00:55:14.229" style="s2"> You think, &quot;Why would you invite something like that to your daughter&#39;s baptism?</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.229" end="00:55:17.869" style="s2"> Especially since you&#39;ve been waiting for her for a long time, and she&#39;s a real princess, and everything is perfect. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.869" end="00:55:18.869" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:55:18.869" end="00:55:22.269" style="s2"> Well, a different story.</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.269" end="00:55:24.140" style="s2"> This is another archetypal story.</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.140" end="00:55:29.259" style="s2"> There are children, and their mother ... their father wants a divorce,</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.259" end="00:55:31.910" style="s2"> whether his wife dies, or whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.910" end="00:55:35.249" style="s2"> He gets a new wife, and she decides she doesn&#39;t like those kids very much.</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.249" end="00:55:36.329" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:55:36.329" end="00:55:38.259" style="s2"> And that happens a lot, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.259" end="00:55:44.489" style="s2"> If you have a stepparent, you are a hundred times more likely to be physically abused.</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.489" end="00:55:46.859" style="s2"> That is the biggest risk factor.</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.859" end="00:55:49.519" style="s2"> Along with having an alcoholic as a parent.</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.519" end="00:55:53.749" style="s2"> An unpleasant bit of statistics.</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.749" end="00:55:56.660" style="s2"> It&#39;s hard enough to tolerate kids, but when they&#39;re someone else&#39;s kids</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.660" end="00:55:57.900" style="s2"> it is even more difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.900" end="00:56:01.319" style="s2"> That&#39;s a Freudian observation, and that&#39;s no joke.</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.319" end="00:56:04.780" style="s2"> People are not that friendly, and there is terrible jealousy.</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.780" end="00:56:09.760" style="s2"> When a husband and wife start dating, and the wife has kids,</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.760" end="00:56:13.769" style="s2"> and the man is jealous, and the children get in the way, especially when they annoy him too,</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.769" end="00:56:16.680" style="s2"> because they might not be happy that he&#39;s not their real dad,</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.680" end="00:56:20.940" style="s2"> maybe he&#39;s just a creep, you don&#39;t know ... the tension that can arise in such a situation,</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.940" end="00:56:25.539" style="s2"> can quickly become completely unbearable, and last indefinitely.</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.539" end="00:56:33.519" style="s2"> So she says to her new husband, &quot;Take those damn kids to the woods,</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.519" end="00:56:37.549" style="s2"> and try to leave them there. ”He&#39;s not happy about that, but he&#39;s under a spell</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.549" end="00:56:41.180" style="s2"> from his new wife, and not very smart, and a little bad too.</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.180" end="00:56:42.180" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:42.180" end="00:56:45.060" style="s2"> So he takes the children to the forest and leaves them there.</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.060" end="00:56:46.589" style="s2"> That sucks for the kids.</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.589" end="00:56:50.619" style="s2"> They&#39;re in the wilderness, as you may feel when your mother dies,</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.619" end="00:56:53.549" style="s2"> and your father marries a new wife.</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.549" end="00:56:54.690" style="s2"> You&#39;re in the wilderness.</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.690" end="00:56:58.069" style="s2"> They get lost and get upset because they are lost.</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.069" end="00:56:59.069" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:59.069" end="00:57:01.410" style="s2"> They will starve, and wolves will eat them, because this is a medieval one</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.410" end="00:57:03.779" style="s2"> European forest, full of wolves, and they eat people.</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.779" end="00:57:09.859" style="s2"> They wander around and come to a gingerbread house.</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.859" end="00:57:15.049" style="s2"> If you are a skeptical person, and not naive, the first thing you think is:</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.049" end="00:57:17.140" style="s2"> &quot;This is too good to be true.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.140" end="00:57:19.339" style="s2"> A house, okay.</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.339" end="00:57:25.160" style="s2"> A hiker&#39;s hut perhaps, or a shelter, that&#39;s possible. But a house made of candy.</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.160" end="00:57:26.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:57:26.160" end="00:57:30.749" style="s2"> Something is wrong there.</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.749" end="00:57:33.869" style="s2"> Do you know those types who pretend to be very nice, but actually aren&#39;t?</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.869" end="00:57:36.490" style="s2"> Do you remember Harry Potter?</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.490" end="00:57:37.619" style="s2"> Do you remember that woman?</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.619" end="00:57:38.619" style="s2"> She was a bureaucrat.</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.619" end="00:57:39.950" style="s2"> She had all those plates with kittens.</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.950" end="00:57:41.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:57:41.140" end="00:57:42.329" style="s2"> Umbridge, Dolores.</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.329" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2"> Dolores means sad.</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:45.210" style="s2"> Umbridge means to take offense.</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.210" end="00:57:48.950" style="s2"> She is the sad woman who takes offense.</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.950" end="00:57:52.380" style="s2"> And she has all kinds of pictures of kittens on her plates.</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.380" end="00:57:53.739" style="s2"> On ceramic plates.</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.739" end="00:57:55.279" style="s2"> They are hyper-sentimental.</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.279" end="00:57:57.029" style="s2"> &quot;Oh, aren&#39;t they cute?</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.029" end="00:58:00.509" style="s2"> They are on plates, and we hang them on the wall. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.509" end="00:58:02.809" style="s2"> Very tasteless.</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.809" end="00:58:07.510" style="s2"> And the sentimentality is a facade.</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.510" end="00:58:11.309" style="s2"> Jung would call that a persona of compassion.</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.309" end="00:58:12.809" style="s2"> But think of that old Dolores Umbridge.</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.809" end="00:58:14.609" style="s2"> She&#39;s not exactly a compassionate type.</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.609" end="00:58:19.349" style="s2"> If you released her into the world, terrible things would happen.</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.349" end="00:58:20.349" style="s2"> And ... what&#39;s her name?</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.349" end="00:58:21.349" style="s2"> The woman who wrote Harry Potter?</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.349" end="00:58:22.380" style="s2"> That was exactly right.</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.380" end="00:58:24.019" style="s2"> It is one of her best characters, I think.</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.019" end="00:58:29.369" style="s2"> She has that hypocritical voice that people use who don&#39;t like children</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.369" end="00:58:32.529" style="s2"> when they talk to children.</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.529" end="00:58:33.799" style="s2"> &quot;Oh, what a sweetheart you are!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.799" end="00:58:35.359" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:58:35.359" end="00:58:38.990" style="s2"> You can actually talk to children, and they like that.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.990" end="00:58:44.161" style="s2"> And then they don&#39;t think you are possessed by anything</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.161" end="00:58:46.910" style="s2"> for which they have to run away as quickly as possible.</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.910" end="00:58:50.270" style="s2"> Anyway, Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.270" end="00:58:52.219" style="s2"> The woman comes out and is very nice.</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.219" end="00:58:54.099" style="s2"> And she says, &quot;Children, you are lost in the forest.</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.099" end="00:58:56.089" style="s2"> Why don&#39;t you come in for some gingerbread? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.089" end="00:59:01.970" style="s2"> And then she puts Hans in a cage, a kind of bird cage I think, and Gretel</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.970" end="00:59:03.799" style="s2"> gets all the slave work.</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.799" end="00:59:05.049" style="s2"> So she&#39;s not that nice.</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.049" end="00:59:09.940" style="s2"> And every day she fills them with gingerbread, and she feels</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.940" end="00:59:14.190" style="s2"> Hansje&#39;s legs, to see if he&#39;s thick enough so that she can put him in the oven</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.190" end="00:59:15.190" style="s2"> and eat it.</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.190" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2"> And that means: beware of people who are too nice to you, because</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:20.970" style="s2"> they try to devour you.</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.970" end="00:59:25.859" style="s2"> It is the most important judgment of Freudian psychopathology.</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.859" end="00:59:30.080" style="s2"> If you have a parent ... Freud focused mainly on mothers because the odds are higher</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.080" end="00:59:31.140" style="s2"> that mothers do this.</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.140" end="00:59:34.779" style="s2"> For a number of reasons, which we won&#39;t talk about,</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.779" end="00:59:39.119" style="s2"> probably because they&#39;re baby-oriented, but well.</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.119" end="00:59:43.960" style="s2"> If you are too nice to your child and do everything for him, what will happen to him?</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.960" end="00:59:48.150" style="s2"> Then he cannot do anything himself.</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.150" end="00:59:49.279" style="s2"> And what happens then?</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.279" end="00:59:52.450" style="s2"> Then he lives in your basement until he is fifty.</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.450" end="00:59:56.930" style="s2"> And one day he gets angry and shoots Dawson College.</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.930" end="01:00:02.180" style="s2"> There is a deep metaphor in the story, namely: if it is too good to be true,</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.180" end="01:00:05.329" style="s2"> it is probably aimed at your destruction.</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.329" end="01:00:07.569" style="s2"> Okay, back to Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.569" end="01:00:12.299" style="s2"> Sleeping Beauty, Aurora, will be baptized, and they decide the evil queen</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.299" end="01:00:14.069" style="s2"> not to be invited to baptism.</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.069" end="01:00:16.499" style="s2"> That is not a good idea.</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.499" end="01:00:25.880" style="s2"> I had a client once, and all she wanted to do was sleep.</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.880" end="01:00:28.100" style="s2"> She slept about sixteen to seventeen hours a day.</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.100" end="01:00:31.150" style="s2"> And she did that partly by taking sleeping pills, because it&#39;s hard to sleep that much.</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.150" end="01:00:34.440" style="s2"> But untouched, she did nothing but sleep.</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.440" end="01:00:39.299" style="s2"> You may ask, &quot;Why would anyone do that?&quot; And you can say:</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.299" end="01:00:43.769" style="s2"> &quot;For the same reason people pass themselves out and drink themselves into destruction.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.769" end="01:00:47.150" style="s2"> It&#39;s painful to have awareness, especially when your life isn&#39;t going well,</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.150" end="01:00:51.069" style="s2"> and you may be afraid of things. So why would you be awake and suffer</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.069" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2"> when you can be unconscious and not suffer?</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:55.460" style="s2"> In fact, that was her idea.</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.460" end="01:01:03.140" style="s2"> She was a vegetarian, and she was terrified of butcher shops, and terrified</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.140" end="01:01:04.219" style="s2"> for raw meat.</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.219" end="01:01:07.560" style="s2"> That made sense, she was terrified of life, as it were. And if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.560" end="01:01:11.019" style="s2"> are afraid of life ... if you think about it, it is, the &quot;raw meat&quot; part of life</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.019" end="01:01:13.539" style="s2"> what you are afraid of.</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.539" end="01:01:16.479" style="s2"> So that was very concrete in her case.</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.479" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2"> So I took her to supermarkets, to the meat department,</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:21.400" style="s2"> because that&#39;s what you do with psychotherapy.</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.400" end="01:01:25.990" style="s2"> If any of you want psychotherapy, you should do what you least want to do,</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.990" end="01:01:27.640" style="s2"> and that&#39;s not particularly fun.</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.640" end="01:01:32.160" style="s2"> That is the road to enlightenment: you walk the road you would least like to walk.</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.160" end="01:01:33.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:01:33.160" end="01:01:36.849" style="s2"> Now you know why people aren&#39;t enlightened, because it&#39;s not all fun and fine,</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.849" end="01:01:38.240" style="s2"> and follow your gut and all that nonsense.</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.240" end="01:01:43.480" style="s2"> It is: discover what you are afraid of, and what you are avoiding, and voluntarily confront it.</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.480" end="01:01:50.249" style="s2"> Either way, I learned a bit from her background. Her mother, whom I met, was certainly the evil queen.</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.249" end="01:01:54.780" style="s2"> She yelled at me for forty-five minutes in my office.</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.780" end="01:01:56.119" style="s2"> Pretty remarkable.</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.119" end="01:02:00.619" style="s2"> I had never ... I had only had one other person yelling at me in my office,</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.619" end="01:02:03.229" style="s2"> and she was an evil queen too.</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.229" end="01:02:05.700" style="s2"> But this woman was really a special case.</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.700" end="01:02:08.609" style="s2"> I watched her performance with my mouth open.</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.609" end="01:02:12.650" style="s2"> She kept calling my client three or four times a day,</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.650" end="01:02:14.430" style="s2"> to tell her how stupid and worthless she was.</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.430" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2"> So if you have parents who call you every day and tell you you&#39;re stupid and worthless</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:24.089" style="s2"> you have your full right not to talk to them,</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.089" end="01:02:25.289" style="s2"> because that&#39;s not how they should talk to you.</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.289" end="01:02:29.380" style="s2"> Then you can say, &quot;Shall I call you instead of you calling me?</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.380" end="01:02:32.789" style="s2"> And every other week, instead of three times a day?</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.789" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2"> And if you say something ugly, I&#39;ll hang up and stop talking to you for a month. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:39.709" style="s2"> And then you might say, &quot;I can&#39;t do that to my mother.&quot; Then I would say</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.709" end="01:02:42.299" style="s2"> &quot;That&#39;s because she&#39;s already won.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.299" end="01:02:49.579" style="s2"> Anyway, her mom loved her dearly when she was little, she was perfect.</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.579" end="01:02:52.569" style="s2"> When she was little she was a princess. But then she entered puberty.</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.569" end="01:02:55.559" style="s2"> And that&#39;s the end of the princess thing, because then</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.559" end="01:03:00.039" style="s2"> you want to go out and have a life and hang out with guys and do all those things</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.039" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2"> that are by no means childish or princess-like.</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:10.479" style="s2"> And then everything went wrong, and it started to develop in a very bad direction.</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.479" end="01:03:14.789" style="s2"> And that was partly because her mother refused to invite the evil queen</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.789" end="01:03:18.390" style="s2"> in her daughter&#39;s life, because the bad queen is the negative aspect of nature.</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.390" end="01:03:22.299" style="s2"> And if you have little girl, chances are she will grow up</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.299" end="01:03:26.029" style="s2"> and will become a teenager, and then a woman. Unless you do something</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.029" end="01:03:28.309" style="s2"> what seriously disrupts that, what you might be doing.</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.309" end="01:03:33.290" style="s2"> So you better be prepared for that when she&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.290" end="01:03:36.690" style="s2"> and not treat her like one whose feet will never touch the earth.</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.690" end="01:03:40.599" style="s2"> You have to have all aspects of life there.</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.599" end="01:03:42.000" style="s2"> I had another client.</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.000" end="01:03:49.009" style="s2"> Her parents taught her that adults were angels, and I don&#39;t mean that metaphorically,</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.009" end="01:03:50.079" style="s2"> they actually taught her that.</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.079" end="01:03:55.079" style="s2"> As a result, they predisposed her to severe post-traumatic stress disorder,</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.079" end="01:03:59.920" style="s2"> which bothered her for about five years. Because she met someone who wasn&#39;t an angel, what a surprise.</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.920" end="01:04:04.900" style="s2"> And all he did was look at her like he wanted to kill her.</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.900" end="01:04:05.900" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:04:05.900" end="01:04:08.460" style="s2"> And you think, &quot;You can&#39;t get traumatized because of that.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.460" end="01:04:12.640" style="s2"> 1) Probably no one has ever looked at you that way, so don&#39;t be too sure.</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.640" end="01:04:17.930" style="s2"> 2) If someone looked at you like that, and you thought adults were angels,</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.930" end="01:04:22.299" style="s2"> then you would be well prone to developing post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.299" end="01:04:26.540" style="s2"> You may think that you are doing your children a favor by the evil queen</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.540" end="01:04:30.380" style="s2"> Keep them out, but you better show her now and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.380" end="01:04:34.339" style="s2"> so they can get used to the fact that it exists.</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.339" end="01:04:37.859" style="s2"> I think that&#39;s partly why children have pets.</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.859" end="01:04:38.859" style="s2"> Like mice, they don&#39;t last long.</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.859" end="01:04:43.380" style="s2"> So you have a live mouse for a while, and then you have a dead mouse.</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.380" end="01:04:44.380" style="s2"> And that is not good.</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.380" end="01:04:47.809" style="s2"> But you get used to things when you do</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.809" end="01:04:50.910" style="s2"> and it may not be good to keep your children safe from that. Because they will</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.910" end="01:04:53.690" style="s2"> have to grow up and survive in the harsh world.</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.690" end="01:04:55.690" style="s2"> And it&#39;s not your job to make them happy.</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.690" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2"> Your job is to make sure they are able to survive in the gruesome real world.</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:04.069" style="s2"> Well, that&#39;s what happens at the beginning of Sleeping Beauty, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.069" end="01:05:05.249" style="s2"> Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.249" end="01:05:09.829" style="s2"> Then the evil queen still appears, because you can&#39;t keep her out,</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.829" end="01:05:13.900" style="s2"> and she says, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s fine and fine.</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.900" end="01:05:16.880" style="s2"> I can not help it. But when puberty comes ... &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.880" end="01:05:22.369" style="s2"> Sleeping Beauty will hurt her finger on a spinning wheel needle.</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.369" end="01:05:23.369" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:05:23.369" end="01:05:27.240" style="s2"> It has to do with blood, and we don&#39;t need much imagination to figure out what that means.</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.240" end="01:05:28.240" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:31.539" style="s2"> &quot;I will come back, and then all will break out.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.539" end="01:05:37.490" style="s2"> And then the parents get all overprotective, which is just the wrong reaction,</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.490" end="01:05:40.309" style="s2"> and that is the story of Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.309" end="01:05:44.930" style="s2"> Eventually the prince arrives and finds out how to solve this problem.</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.930" end="01:05:50.019" style="s2"> She needs him, he&#39;s a good boy. But the bad queen puts him in a dungeon,</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.019" end="01:05:54.789" style="s2"> in her basement, and she wants to keep him there until he is his age</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.789" end="01:05:58.519" style="s2"> that he can no longer ride a horse. And she will laugh at him when he tries to escape.</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.519" end="01:06:02.069" style="s2"> And then he tries to escape, and she turns into a dragon.</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.069" end="01:06:03.069" style="s2"> &quot;What is that?</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.069" end="01:06:04.450" style="s2"> Why does she turn into a dragon? &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.450" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2"> But you accept that.</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:06.680" style="s2"> No problem.</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.680" end="01:06:08.859" style="s2"> &quot;Of course the evil queen turns into a dragon.</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.859" end="01:06:10.009" style="s2"> What else would she do? &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.009" end="01:06:13.319" style="s2"> And then she spits fire at him, and he knocks her off.</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.319" end="01:06:17.859" style="s2"> And then he must cut his way through the thorns and thistles that cover the castle</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.859" end="01:06:19.190" style="s2"> entwined.</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.190" end="01:06:23.089" style="s2"> Then he wakes up the girl, and the fountains come on again, and everyone is happy.</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.089" end="01:06:25.609" style="s2"> And you think that&#39;s a great story.</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.609" end="01:06:29.339" style="s2"> And it is a great story, but it is a strange story, because it is an archetypal story</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.339" end="01:06:33.059" style="s2"> and you understand it on an archetypal level.</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.059" end="01:06:40.789" style="s2"> Let&#39;s take a look at some of it, and I&#39;ll talk a little bit more about it.</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.789" end="01:07:11.999" style="s2"> To get started, let&#39;s see the beginning.</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.999" end="01:07:30.769" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:30.769" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2"> Sorry.</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:48.820" style="s2"> This is a lesson, so I don&#39;t want you to enjoy the movie. So I&#39;m going to play with it.</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.820" end="01:07:49.820" style="s2"> Well, tell me about the book.</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.820" end="01:07:51.010" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:51.010" end="01:07:54.670" style="s2"> Is it a valuable book or not?</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.670" end="01:07:55.989" style="s2"> How do you know that?</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.989" end="01:07:56.989" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:56.989" end="01:07:57.989" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:57.989" end="01:08:00.890" style="s2"> Yes, it is inlaid with good and jewels. There you get a hint,</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.890" end="01:08:01.890" style="s2"> that it is something valuable.</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.890" end="01:08:03.089" style="s2"> Let&#39;s see if it works.</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.089" end="01:08:10.239" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:08:10.239" end="01:08:16.120" style="s2"> Yes, that&#39;s right. Yes, it is a valuable book, it is inlaid with goods and jewels.</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.120" end="01:08:18.970" style="s2"> Why is gold valuable?</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.970" end="01:08:20.389" style="s2"> It&#39;s scarce.</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.389" end="01:08:25.270" style="s2"> Yes. It looks like the sun.</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.270" end="01:08:26.270" style="s2"> What else?</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.270" end="01:08:27.819" style="s2"> It&#39;s morally pure, gold.</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.819" end="01:08:28.819" style="s2"> Why?</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.819" end="01:08:29.819" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:08:29.819" end="01:08:30.819" style="s2"> Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.819" end="01:08:31.819" style="s2"> It&#39;s wealth.</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.819" end="01:08:35.589" style="s2"> But it is morally pure, because it cannot be mixed with other metals.</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.589" end="01:08:38.089" style="s2"> It does not mix with other metals.</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.089" end="01:08:43.630" style="s2"> It is not subject to decay and contamination, so it is a symbol of purity.</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.630" end="01:08:47.259" style="s2"> And jewelry, why are they beautiful and valuable?</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.259" end="01:08:48.270" style="s2"> Don&#39;t scarcely.</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.270" end="01:08:49.270" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:08:49.270" end="01:08:50.710" style="s2"> Yes, they sparkle.</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.710" end="01:08:52.460" style="s2"> Even crows can appreciate that.</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.460" end="01:08:54.750" style="s2"> What&#39;s glittering got to do with it?</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.750" end="01:08:55.750" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:08:55.750" end="01:08:56.750" style="s2"> The sun.</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.750" end="01:08:58.150" style="s2"> Yes, it reflects light.</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.150" end="01:08:59.960" style="s2"> What should a good person do?</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.960" end="01:09:01.230" style="s2"> You might say ...</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.230" end="01:09:02.230" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:09:02.230" end="01:09:03.230" style="s2"> Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.230" end="01:09:04.230" style="s2"> He reflects light.</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.230" end="01:09:08.159" style="s2"> It&#39;s interesting because the reason crystals are the way they are</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.159" end="01:09:11.650" style="s2"> transparent and reflective, is because their inner structure ...</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.650" end="01:09:18.109" style="s2"> A crystal is a lattice of molecules, and you will find the same lattices everywhere in the crystal.</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.109" end="01:09:22.130" style="s2"> So it&#39;s one thing, all the way down to the molecular level.</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.130" end="01:09:25.029" style="s2"> What you can think about is ... especially when you think</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.029" end="01:09:29.799" style="s2"> to the hierarchical model we discussed ... if you were best put together,</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.799" end="01:09:34.069" style="s2"> and experienced the right amount of heat and pressure,</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.069" end="01:09:37.880" style="s2"> then you would be the same on every level of your being.</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.880" end="01:09:41.609" style="s2"> Then you would be strong and crystal-like, and you would reflect light.</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.609" end="01:09:46.560" style="s2"> Either way, you&#39;ll immediately get a hint that this story is valuable.</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.560" end="01:09:47.560" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:09:47.560" end="01:09:48.560" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:09:48.560" end="01:09:49.560" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="01:11:43.420" end="01:11:44.690" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:44.690" end="01:11:45.690" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:45.690" end="01:11:47.739" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:47.739" end="01:11:54.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:54.420" end="01:12:15.750" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:15.750" end="01:12:20.010" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:20.010" end="01:12:26.010" style="s2"> So these are the good elements of the feminine, and they give her various gifts.</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.010" end="01:12:27.010" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:27.010" end="01:12:28.010" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="01:13:32.230" end="01:13:34.960" style="s2"> Okay, we&#39;re out of time.</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.960" end="01:13:40.210" style="s2"> I&#39;ll show you more of this in the next lesson, and we&#39;ll see what it means.</p>
