<p begin="00:00:06.629" end="00:00:11.940" style="s2">time that in some ways you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.380" end="00:00:13.670" style="s2">many different kind of indicates and say</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.940" end="00:00:16.830" style="s2">this is the best time to be alive and</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.670" end="00:00:19.140" style="s2">yet at the same time you and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.830" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">other writers that I&#39;m following have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:23.970" style="s2">real kind of apocalyptic tinge to their</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:25.859" style="s2">writing are those two things true at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:29.609" style="s2">same time that&#39;s a very good question</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.859" end="00:00:32.360" style="s2">let me see if I can puzzle it out so one</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.609" end="00:00:40.790" style="s2">of the metaphors that I&#39;ve found is very</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.360" end="00:00:40.790" style="s2">helpful is the metaphor of a caterpillar</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.230" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">voraciously devouring leaves so from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">point of view of the caterpillar there</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">is a the experience of becoming fatter</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:57.660" style="s2">and fatter and all things are going well</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">it&#39;s good to be a fat caterpillar now</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.660" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">from the point of view of the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.399" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">things are going rather poorly and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">you zoom back out you will look at it</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">and say hmm there&#39;s a paradox that on</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:11.070" style="s2">the one hand has never been a better</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:12.510" style="s2">time to be a caterpillar and on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.070" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">other hand I&#39;m noticing that the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.510" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">are getting ready to go away and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">things are about to get very bad very</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:21.979" style="s2">quickly but then there&#39;s even deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">insight which is that caterpillars</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.979" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">devour and just destroy everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">around them in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:31.159" style="s2">endeavouring to become a butterfly and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:35.329" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s actually the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.159" end="00:01:39.030" style="s2">notion that if you look at our</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.329" end="00:01:44.220" style="s2">civilization from the perspective of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:44.790" style="s2">is a caterpillar it is becoming more of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.220" end="00:01:47.689" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.790" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">so it&#39;s flourishing on that basis it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.689" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">rapidly consuming a substantial fraction</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">of the environment that&#39;s necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">it to continue being where it is and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">then this ends up in one of two possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">states either it hits some kind of wall</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">where some piece of that support</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">structure fails in which case it just</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">dies or it actually enters into this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">moment of metamorphosis and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">transforms into another kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:16.410" style="s2">altogether I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:18.540" style="s2">perspective that I bring I can&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.410" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">for anyone else what are the indicators</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.540" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">that make you think that things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">getting much worse than maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">appear on the surface well I guess</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:28.020" style="s2">probably the most important is is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:31.020" style="s2">fact that I&#39;ve been looking at this now</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.020" end="00:02:32.940" style="s2">for quite some time and so the models</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.020" end="00:02:37.140" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been using to try to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.940" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">sense of a number of different college</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.140" end="00:02:41.720" style="s2">of systems for now divergent pieces or</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:45.560" style="s2">characters because of the world have</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.720" end="00:02:51.530" style="s2">predicted a number of things that were</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.560" end="00:02:53.640" style="s2">at the time didn&#39;t seem to be reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.530" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">let&#39;s go with like the Trump election</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">this is kind of a very concrete one so</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:01.140" style="s2">the models predicted brexit the models</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:03.000" style="s2">predicted Trump or something along those</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.140" end="00:03:04.830" style="s2">lines not exactly the events of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.000" end="00:03:06.570" style="s2">characteristics or specific my specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.830" end="00:03:10.260" style="s2">models right</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:12.420" style="s2">and so I&#39;m in some sense I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.260" end="00:03:15.239" style="s2">simple if I have models and the models</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:16.500" style="s2">are predictive and particularly when</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.239" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">they&#39;re predictive in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.500" end="00:03:23.130" style="s2">contra conventional wisdom I give those</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:24.060" style="s2">models more credence so I run lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.130" end="00:03:25.650" style="s2">models I don&#39;t have like two or three</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.060" end="00:03:28.049" style="s2">I&#39;ve got lots and lots of models and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.650" end="00:03:30.810" style="s2">some of them have been increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.049" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">accurately predicting circumstances and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.810" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">others have been less and so these have</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:37.560" style="s2">begun pay less attention to these and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">give more credence to these and as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.560" end="00:03:42.600" style="s2">watched these these are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:46.430" style="s2">tell me that we&#39;re on a particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.600" end="00:03:49.049" style="s2">of trajectory and that trajectory has</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.430" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">well it has characteristics that you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.049" end="00:03:52.079" style="s2">use to say okay here&#39;s what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:53.489" style="s2">like it has how it would play out and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.079" end="00:03:55.950" style="s2">more importantly it actually has a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.489" end="00:03:57.150" style="s2">specific finite endpoint so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.950" end="00:04:00.090" style="s2">on the kind of trajectory that has an</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.150" end="00:04:01.980" style="s2">ending to it and that many of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.090" end="00:04:04.459" style="s2">metrics a minute of the phenomenon that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.980" end="00:04:06.269" style="s2">we&#39;re witnessing in many different ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.459" end="00:04:07.590" style="s2">right now it&#39;s showing up very</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.269" end="00:04:10.980" style="s2">viscerally in terms of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.590" end="00:04:14.610" style="s2">culture and society are showing or</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.980" end="00:04:17.579" style="s2">feeling particularly the West are</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.610" end="00:04:19.560" style="s2">indicative of their of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.579" end="00:04:23.099" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of far along the curve on</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.560" end="00:04:24.120" style="s2">this particular dynamic so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.099" end="00:04:26.539" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that I&#39;m going about</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.120" end="00:04:26.539" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of unfortunately into</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:32.860" style="s2">explaining that double-clicking on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.470" style="s2">is not easy I&#39;ve actually spent some</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.860" end="00:04:37.570" style="s2">time critics and YouTube videos and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.470" end="00:04:40.150" style="s2">medium posts trying to actually take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.570" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">particular set of concepts and like</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.150" end="00:04:45.580" style="s2">making them small enough to convey in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:47.020" style="s2">in a byte and I guess some of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.580" end="00:04:48.730" style="s2">been successful but if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.020" end="00:04:49.990" style="s2">about a curve and you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.730" end="00:04:51.460" style="s2">we&#39;re far along this curve and it has an</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.990" end="00:04:53.890" style="s2">endpoint what what is the curve what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.460" end="00:04:55.780" style="s2">the endpoint well the reality is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.890" end="00:04:58.300" style="s2">actually many many curves and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.780" end="00:04:59.500" style="s2">not all of the same meaning that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.300" end="00:05:00.730" style="s2">not they don&#39;t have the same basis and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.500" end="00:05:06.070" style="s2">was the same causal structure behind</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.730" end="00:05:08.260" style="s2">them so I&#39;ll give you three one curve is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.070" end="00:05:11.410" style="s2">called the Tainter curve the Tainter</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.260" end="00:05:14.470" style="s2">curve is was used by an anthropologist</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.410" end="00:05:17.320" style="s2">to try to figure out and describe why it</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.470" end="00:05:19.030" style="s2">was that complicated civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.320" end="00:05:20.980" style="s2">collapsed he actually called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.030" end="00:05:23.980" style="s2">collapse of complex civilizations but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.980" end="00:05:29.020" style="s2">have to modify that for four specific</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.980" end="00:05:31.180" style="s2">reasons and we can investigate if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.020" end="00:05:33.490" style="s2">like what this curve is and why it works</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.180" end="00:05:40.090" style="s2">and how it shows up but it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.490" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">with the way that human beings design</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.090" end="00:05:47.140" style="s2">and reinforce the kinds of institutional</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:49.450" style="s2">structures that we use to meet our needs</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.140" end="00:05:51.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s a particular set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.450" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">characteristics of how these structures</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.880" end="00:06:00.670" style="s2">become bound meaning they become those</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:06:03.700" style="s2">oils an example so in the beginning we</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.670" end="00:06:07.510" style="s2">use oil partial for kerosene by the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.700" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">to light things up and as a secondary</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.510" end="00:06:10.150" style="s2">distillate we have gasoline we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:11.470" style="s2">really use much gasoline and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.150" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">actually kind of easy to get you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.470" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">Pennsylvania and a little bit of effort</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:17.830" style="s2">you can get some oil out of the ground</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:19.540" style="s2">so then we begin to say repurpose</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.830" end="00:06:21.340" style="s2">gasoline in it being fuel for cars and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.540" end="00:06:23.110" style="s2">so this increases the utility the value</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.340" end="00:06:24.940" style="s2">suppose expands the potential of our of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.110" end="00:06:29.770" style="s2">our civilization so we kind of moved up</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.940" end="00:06:31.420" style="s2">this curve or our energy usage the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.770" end="00:06:33.250" style="s2">amount of energy we have to spend to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.420" end="00:06:35.290" style="s2">the oil and convert into gasoline</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.290" end="00:06:38.500" style="s2">investment and so we do right so when</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.870" end="00:06:40.450" style="s2">it&#39;s up happiness</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.500" end="00:06:43.870" style="s2">two distinct things simultaneously one</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.450" end="00:06:45.690" style="s2">is we actually expand our underlying use</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.870" end="00:06:48.130" style="s2">of this energy source we build more cars</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.690" end="00:06:49.780" style="s2">and maybe because it makes it easier for</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.130" end="00:06:51.220" style="s2">us to grow food we grow more food then</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.780" end="00:06:53.590" style="s2">we have more people so we expand the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.220" end="00:06:55.990" style="s2">base that uses it relies upon this</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.590" end="00:06:57.880" style="s2">capacity but at the same time we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.990" end="00:07:00.490" style="s2">plucking the low-hanging fruit of access</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.880" end="00:07:02.410" style="s2">to the resource so it gets harder and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.490" end="00:07:04.210" style="s2">have to actually drill deeper wells or</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.410" end="00:07:06.940" style="s2">we have to frack to be able to pull out</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.210" end="00:07:08.560" style="s2">the kind of oil now what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.940" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">is that this is why I said it&#39;s complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.560" end="00:07:13.510" style="s2">this is not a simple thing it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:14.440" style="s2">the second order that matters because</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.510" end="00:07:17.950" style="s2">what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll say okay what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.440" end="00:07:20.200" style="s2">gotten harder so we&#39;ll invest in R&amp;D so</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.950" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll get smarter so we we get more we</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.200" end="00:07:24.190" style="s2">get certain advancements in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:25.690" style="s2">underlying technical basis that we use</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.190" end="00:07:27.700" style="s2">to extract the resource so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.690" end="00:07:29.740" style="s2">curve on the technical basis but what</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.700" end="00:07:30.970" style="s2">ends up happening is is that as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.740" end="00:07:33.070" style="s2">picking the low-hanging lowest hanging</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.970" end="00:07:34.600" style="s2">fruit at the resource level we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.070" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">picking the lowest hanging fruit at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.600" end="00:07:38.980" style="s2">R&amp;D level - there&#39;s a certain period of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:40.540" style="s2">time where our R&amp;D is kicking ass we</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.980" end="00:07:43.180" style="s2">spend a million dollars on R&amp;D will get</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.540" end="00:07:44.710" style="s2">massive advances but at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.180" end="00:07:46.510" style="s2">in time that has what&#39;s known as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.710" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">s-curve meaning that we&#39;ve picked all</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.510" end="00:07:49.479" style="s2">the low-hanging fruit in innovation</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:50.979" style="s2">space we&#39;ve figured out all the easy</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.479" end="00:07:53.530" style="s2">wins and now we&#39;re starting to have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.979" end="00:07:55.660" style="s2">work harder to get harder wins we</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.530" end="00:07:58.150" style="s2">figured out how to do drilling that goes</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.660" end="00:08:00.100" style="s2">diagonal and that was one really nice</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.150" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">win and we got you got that one now we</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.100" end="00:08:02.350" style="s2">have to do fracking now I have to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:03.850" style="s2">whatever is next right so just gets</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.350" end="00:08:05.979" style="s2">harder and harder and harder so at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.850" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">certain point what happens is is that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.979" end="00:08:09.910" style="s2">may have to spend a hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:12.760" style="s2">dollars to get a two percent increase in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.910" end="00:08:15.190" style="s2">performance while simultaneously we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.760" end="00:08:16.810" style="s2">now really picking deep fruit so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.190" end="00:08:18.550" style="s2">getting deeper and deeper and harder and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.810" end="00:08:19.810" style="s2">more expensive to extract and in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.550" end="00:08:21.580" style="s2">meantime over on this side of the house</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.810" end="00:08:23.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve built out an entire gigantic</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.580" end="00:08:24.340" style="s2">global infrastructure that absolutely is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.020" end="00:08:25.900" style="s2">fully fundamentally dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.340" end="00:08:27.729" style="s2">gasoline from virtually everything like</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.900" end="00:08:29.620" style="s2">if your car stop tomorrow you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.729" end="00:08:32.589" style="s2">get groceries all right so we&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.620" end="00:08:34.960" style="s2">more dependent on the resource we become</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.589" end="00:08:36.370" style="s2">we tap out the R&amp;D site which in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.960" end="00:08:37.659" style="s2">beginning looks awesome we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.370" end="00:08:39.969" style="s2">massive gains until we&#39;ve reached the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.659" end="00:08:41.589" style="s2">end point and we&#39;ve made it we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.969" end="00:08:42.370" style="s2">to the end of the easy pickings and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.589" end="00:08:44.020" style="s2">things are getting harder and harder</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.370" end="00:08:46.089" style="s2">harder so what happens is we generate</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.020" end="00:08:47.500" style="s2">fragility we generate an environment</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.089" end="00:08:49.690" style="s2">where we&#39;re having to spend more and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.500" end="00:08:51.630" style="s2">more energy either in terms of R&amp;D or in</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.690" end="00:08:54.510" style="s2">terms of just absolute activity</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.630" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">maintain where we are but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.510" end="00:08:57.900" style="s2">getting harder and harder to hold and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">the consequences of falling back become</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.900" end="00:09:01.860" style="s2">worse and worse now this curve actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.440" style="s2">has one of their characteristic to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.860" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">which is we&#39;re now way over our skis</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.440" end="00:09:11.190" style="s2">like it may have been that call it in</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">nineteen twenty 1932 to shift and go</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.190" end="00:09:15.810" style="s2">from a gasoline economy to say an</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:18.660" style="s2">electricity economy and we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.810" end="00:09:20.760" style="s2">committed to cars but we&#39;ve we&#39;ve passed</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:22.200" style="s2">that fork in the road so all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.760" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">different choices we could have made in</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.200" end="00:09:24.870" style="s2">the past and have become narrowed and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:26.340" style="s2">narrowed and narratives we just have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.870" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">double down more and more and more on</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.340" end="00:09:29.070" style="s2">this so we&#39;ve actually kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">become an addict we&#39;ve come in dicted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.070" end="00:09:32.940" style="s2">a particular approach and just like an</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:34.830" style="s2">addict that approaches starting to give</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.940" end="00:09:36.810" style="s2">us diminishing returns and so that hits</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.830" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">a wall and so that the Tainter curve in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.810" end="00:09:41.820" style="s2">a nutshell and there&#39;s this can happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">across particular domains so you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.820" end="00:09:46.290" style="s2">show oil an oil might show up in just</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:50.130" style="s2">the domain that I described which was</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:51.450" style="s2">technology resource and economy but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.130" end="00:09:53.280" style="s2">might also see how it shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.450" end="00:09:55.500" style="s2">geopolitics and it may be that we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.280" end="00:09:58.680" style="s2">to actually go out and say use our</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.500" end="00:09:59.940" style="s2">military to sustain the Saudi regime not</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:01.500" style="s2">because we like them or think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.940" end="00:10:03.060" style="s2">filling a lot but because they have oil</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.500" end="00:10:04.980" style="s2">and if we don&#39;t have oil our economy</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.060" end="00:10:07.620" style="s2">collapses right so now we&#39;re generating</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.980" end="00:10:09.240" style="s2">externalities in the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:10.950" style="s2">we&#39;re creating pollution and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.240" end="00:10:13.350" style="s2">generating externalities in geopolitics</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.950" end="00:10:15.390" style="s2">which creates systemic fragility in</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.350" end="00:10:16.680" style="s2">other places the point is that as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.390" end="00:10:18.030" style="s2">creating something which becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.680" end="00:10:19.590" style="s2">and more and more fragile with more and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.030" end="00:10:22.290" style="s2">more and more impact you&#39;re setting</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.590" end="00:10:24.300" style="s2">yourself up for a for a bad situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.290" end="00:10:26.070" style="s2">and you can&#39;t back out of it elegantly</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.300" end="00:10:28.710" style="s2">right you&#39;re very much having to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.070" end="00:10:31.470" style="s2">forward and so it is if happening is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.710" end="00:10:33.290" style="s2">that rarely on some some very rare</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.470" end="00:10:35.880" style="s2">circumstances there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.290" end="00:10:38.340" style="s2">consciousness and enlightened choice</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.880" end="00:10:39.810" style="s2">making to be able to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.340" end="00:10:42.990" style="s2">things are not working out and then we</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.810" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">need to step back and shift and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.990" end="00:10:47.250" style="s2">that&#39;s happened two or three times in</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:48.360" style="s2">human history is a very rare thing most</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.250" end="00:10:49.530" style="s2">of the time what ends up happening is</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.360" end="00:10:51.060" style="s2">that we run smack into the wall</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.530" end="00:10:53.460" style="s2">particular because quite often the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.060" end="00:10:54.330" style="s2">decision makers are in a position where</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.460" end="00:10:55.650" style="s2">they feel like they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.330" end="00:10:58.590" style="s2">insulate themselves from the negative</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.650" end="00:10:59.850" style="s2">consequences and so it&#39;s okay to run the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.590" end="00:11:01.200" style="s2">hoi polloi into the wall because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.850" end="00:11:02.910" style="s2">going to be ok what they don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.200" end="00:11:04.500" style="s2">is that they are actually sitting on top</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.910" end="00:11:05.410" style="s2">of the hoi polloi and it&#39;s all a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.500" end="00:11:06.610" style="s2">seamless web</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.410" end="00:11:07.900" style="s2">and so it ends up happening is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.610" end="00:11:11.260" style="s2">elites basically drive us right off the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.900" end="00:11:12.670" style="s2">cliff because they don&#39;t fully feel the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.260" end="00:11:15.450" style="s2">consequences of the choices that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.670" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">making so that&#39;s the the Tainter curve</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.450" end="00:11:21.970" style="s2">another one which is reinforcing it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:23.470" style="s2">something I&#39;m calling the Bryce</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.970" end="00:11:27.130" style="s2">Highsmith model I have the two</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.130" end="00:11:32.170" style="s2">it works kind of like this you have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:36.280" style="s2">basically a series of phase transitions</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.170" end="00:11:38.820" style="s2">in game theory so in the beginning you</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.280" end="00:11:41.880" style="s2">have a group of individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.820" end="00:11:48.220" style="s2">tightly coherent and are able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.880" end="00:11:49.180" style="s2">maintain their ability to do that or if</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.220" end="00:11:51.100" style="s2">you know how the prisoner&#39;s dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.180" end="00:11:52.900" style="s2">works but their ability to resolve the</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.810" end="00:12:06.940" style="s2">sense that if they defect they will have</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.750" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">negative consequences so they they feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.940" end="00:12:10.390" style="s2">like they&#39;re playing a multiple version</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:12.640" style="s2">of the prisoner&#39;s dilemma game so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.390" end="00:12:14.050" style="s2">if they act badly the consequences will</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.640" end="00:12:16.630" style="s2">come back to them and so they choose to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.050" end="00:12:18.670" style="s2">act well and that generates the global</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.630" end="00:12:20.410" style="s2">optimum which is better and so this</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.670" end="00:12:21.910" style="s2">group is is thrives right so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.410" end="00:12:23.800" style="s2">a group that&#39;s working well it can solve</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.800" end="00:12:28.150" style="s2">and so it happens is that it gross but</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.680" end="00:12:35.890" style="s2">so you might imagine let&#39;s just make a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.940" end="00:12:38.710" style="s2">simple version the first version is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.890" end="00:12:41.290" style="s2">actual tribe so this is a tribe and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.710" end="00:12:43.510" style="s2">relating to nature and what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.290" end="00:12:45.430" style="s2">that as it becomes successful the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.510" end="00:12:47.050" style="s2">expands and it expands and expands and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.430" end="00:12:48.790" style="s2">expands until the mechanisms that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.050" end="00:12:52.690" style="s2">originally used to close the loop on</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.790" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">justice to make sure that everybody took</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.690" end="00:12:58.540" style="s2">responsibility for not defecting become</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.540" end="00:13:02.890" style="s2">starting to open up little gaps some</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.460" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">possibilities where I can maybe get away</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:08.260" style="s2">won&#39;t have to bear the full cost or</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.090" end="00:13:09.880" style="s2">there&#39;s some reasonable probability that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.260" end="00:13:11.800" style="s2">I won&#39;t have to bear the full cost so</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.880" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">the game theory starts to shift so now</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.800" end="00:13:15.670" style="s2">you might imagine that the tribe was</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:17.980" style="s2">relating to nature but now the tribe has</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.670" end="00:13:19.190" style="s2">become the niche so will end up</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.980" end="00:13:21.260" style="s2">happening is little tiny</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.190" end="00:13:22.760" style="s2">crow tribes will begin to emerge who are</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.870" end="00:13:33.800" style="s2">so what ends up happening is it you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.870" end="00:13:35.480" style="s2">criminal gangs for example but also</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.800" end="00:13:38.450" style="s2">bureaucracies and bureaucrats any</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.590" end="00:13:53.870" style="s2">doing is skimming a little bit off the</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.100" end="00:14:01.340" style="s2">justice the loop coming back to me then</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.780" end="00:14:04.580" style="s2">game theory says that people will begin</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.340" end="00:14:07.250" style="s2">to play that game so the problem is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.580" end="00:14:09.950" style="s2">that as you begin to do that it begins</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.250" end="00:14:13.220" style="s2">to actually create a downward spiral</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.950" end="00:14:15.740" style="s2">meaning that well if you&#39;re cheating and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.220" end="00:14:17.770" style="s2">I&#39;m not then I&#39;m losing and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.740" end="00:14:20.360" style="s2">classic is called a multipolar dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.770" end="00:14:22.490" style="s2">it&#39;s shows up in all kinds of different</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.360" end="00:14:26.200" style="s2">stories about collective action problems</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.490" end="00:14:28.520" style="s2">a classic example might be if we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.200" end="00:14:32.870" style="s2">fishing from a shared fishing resource</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.520" end="00:14:35.900" style="s2">and if we all only fish a hundred fish</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.870" end="00:14:37.550" style="s2">the resource works great if we all fish</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.900" end="00:14:39.530" style="s2">a thousand fish the resource completely</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.550" end="00:14:41.270" style="s2">collapses but if you can get away with</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.530" end="00:14:42.620" style="s2">fishing 500 fish and I&#39;m only fishing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.270" end="00:14:46.550" style="s2">hundred fish then the resource base</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.620" end="00:14:47.690" style="s2">survives and you win that&#39;s one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.550" end="00:14:50.420" style="s2">one example there&#39;s many many examples</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.690" end="00:14:52.550" style="s2">as one of them the broader concept is a</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.250" end="00:15:02.390" style="s2">the ability to enforce justice and force</p>

<p begin="00:15:02.390" end="00:15:06.890" style="s2">so what ends up happening is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.520" end="00:15:08.360" style="s2">the body of the society continues to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.890" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">endure for a while because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.360" end="00:15:11.330" style="s2">generativity involved in just lots of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:13.430" style="s2">people working together in a culture to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.330" end="00:15:14.600" style="s2">society but the cracks begin to form and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.430" end="00:15:18.260" style="s2">as the cracks form</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.600" end="00:15:19.850" style="s2">it drives choice making meaning that the</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.100" end="00:16:28.630" style="s2">happening is that everybody begins to</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:34.660" style="s2">they have to start being a player now of</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.680" end="00:16:36.610" style="s2">course as it&#39;s everyone becomes there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.610" end="00:16:40.150" style="s2">point if you look around the table and</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.050" end="00:17:15.220" style="s2">and again the whole society collapses</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.890" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">curves and that seems like a process</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:27.160" style="s2">that&#39;s being sped up by an actor like</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">he&#39;s building that that narrative into</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:43.960" style="s2">there&#39;s two things first is I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.510" end="00:17:45.400" style="s2">put an asterisk next to Trump which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.960" end="00:17:49.730" style="s2">to say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.400" end="00:17:51.410" style="s2">every quite quite often people tried to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.730" end="00:17:53.710" style="s2">think that they understand him and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.410" end="00:17:58.010" style="s2">then they reify him into some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.710" end="00:17:58.940" style="s2">artifact that I certainly don&#39;t know him</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.010" end="00:18:00.470" style="s2">well enough to be able to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.940" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">specifically about him so I can do this</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.470" end="00:18:05.900" style="s2">I can identify a particular character</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:07.430" style="s2">that has certain characteristics and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.900" end="00:18:09.980" style="s2">that&#39;s not a bad story there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.430" end="00:18:11.330" style="s2">a Trump character who shows up with his</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.980" end="00:18:15.230" style="s2">characteristics you might say that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.330" end="00:18:17.510" style="s2">the the embodiment of a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.230" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">aggressive poker player who&#39;s happy to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.510" end="00:18:23.540" style="s2">play chaos right and understands how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:25.670" style="s2">thrive in chaos and fundamentally is</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.540" end="00:18:27.470" style="s2">kind of peak predator of that fractal</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.670" end="00:18:29.570" style="s2">defection land that&#39;s just where he</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.470" end="00:18:31.880" style="s2">comes from and so for him it&#39;s intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.570" end="00:18:33.320" style="s2">and sensible that one behaves in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.880" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">fashion and therefore it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.320" end="00:18:38.150" style="s2">effective in this stage I mean it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:40.790" style="s2">know the Lannisters out-compete the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.150" end="00:18:43.340" style="s2">Starks until chaos actually happens</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.790" end="00:18:44.660" style="s2">right until winter actually comes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.340" end="00:18:47.750" style="s2">actually better to be a Lannister than a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.660" end="00:18:49.640" style="s2">stark in King&#39;s Landing and so but then</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.750" end="00:18:51.860" style="s2">yes it&#39;s the point that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.640" end="00:18:54.050" style="s2">accelerate the process you know again</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.860" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">the it&#39;s actually sorry I think you may</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.050" end="00:18:58.520" style="s2">be pointed out something separate which</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">is equally important if I am of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.520" end="00:19:01.460" style="s2">sort if I&#39;m playing that kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:03.410" style="s2">it&#39;s in my interest so make sure the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.460" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">game is of that sort so I actually have</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.410" end="00:19:08.390" style="s2">an interest to break the justice links</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.430" style="s2">to make things more chaotic because I</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.390" end="00:19:11.720" style="s2">thrive in that niche I thrive in chaos I</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.430" end="00:19:14.720" style="s2">don&#39;t thrive in order in order I might</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.720" end="00:19:17.270" style="s2">in fact be called out and home from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.720" end="00:19:18.680" style="s2">nearest tree so I actually need to spin</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.270" end="00:19:21.290" style="s2">more chaos because that&#39;s where I thrive</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.680" end="00:19:23.300" style="s2">so yes you&#39;ve got both my activities</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.290" end="00:19:24.950" style="s2">make more chaos but then even</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.300" end="00:19:26.330" style="s2">intentionally I have an invested</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.950" end="00:19:27.890" style="s2">interest in increasing the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.330" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">chaos just because that&#39;s what I&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.890" end="00:19:33.800" style="s2">at so that&#39;s an example of a second</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:36.560" style="s2">curve then we&#39;ve got other curves let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.800" end="00:19:39.110" style="s2">take for example the the exponential</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.560" end="00:19:40.910" style="s2">technology curve one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.110" end="00:19:43.910" style="s2">characteristics about exponential curves</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.910" end="00:19:46.370" style="s2">is that they go to infinity as far as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.910" end="00:19:49.820" style="s2">know we don&#39;t have the ability to go to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.370" end="00:19:51.140" style="s2">infinity in say processing power which</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.820" end="00:19:52.580" style="s2">means at some point they have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.140" end="00:19:54.830" style="s2">actually stop being exponential they</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.580" end="00:19:57.230" style="s2">have to be some kind of an s-curve or by</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.830" end="00:19:58.370" style="s2">the way just a straight draw so when we</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.230" end="00:19:59.220" style="s2">take a look at where we are on the x</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.370" end="00:20:01.260" style="s2">button</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.220" end="00:20:03.000" style="s2">on the technology curve we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.260" end="00:20:04.770" style="s2">into pretty significant Exponential&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.000" end="00:20:09.450" style="s2">we&#39;re doing some very powerful things</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.770" end="00:20:10.919" style="s2">and one it is for sure the case that at</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.450" end="00:20:13.049" style="s2">some point in the not-too-distant future</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.919" end="00:20:15.510" style="s2">by that I might mean a hundred years or</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.049" end="00:20:17.100" style="s2">a thousand years we reach the end of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.510" end="00:20:18.770" style="s2">that exponential all I have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.100" end="00:20:21.510" style="s2">sort of forward project Moore&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.770" end="00:20:23.100" style="s2">multiplied by the amount of BTUs per</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.510" end="00:20:28.460" style="s2">unit processing power and you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.100" end="00:20:32.570" style="s2">point where the computational energy on</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.460" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">the planet generates enough entropy to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.570" end="00:20:38.190" style="s2">evaporate the entire atmosphere for</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:39.510" style="s2">example or the atomic bound of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.190" end="00:20:41.700" style="s2">mechanics can&#39;t actually produce any</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.510" end="00:20:45.020" style="s2">more forward advancement so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.700" end="00:20:48.330" style="s2">curve that has a certain characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.020" end="00:20:50.429" style="s2">but let me talk about a variation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.330" end="00:20:53.640" style="s2">what happens in that context so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.429" end="00:20:56.610" style="s2">back to game theory so I have I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.640" end="00:20:58.470" style="s2">playing I&#39;m playing a game to win and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.610" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">you&#39;re playing a game to win and when</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.470" end="00:21:04.980" style="s2">does the way this game works is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.370" style="s2">zero-sum so if I win you lose if you win</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.980" end="00:21:07.830" style="s2">I lose</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.370" end="00:21:08.909" style="s2">so this shows up a lot right so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.830" end="00:21:10.710" style="s2">playing that kind of game is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.909" end="00:21:13.350" style="s2">certain characteristic now in this game</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.710" end="00:21:14.940" style="s2">I have a strong incentive to become more</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.350" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">effective because otherwise I will lose</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.940" end="00:21:18.630" style="s2">and you have a strong incentive to so</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:19.830" style="s2">one of us is going to be able to be more</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.630" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">effective than the other one we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.830" end="00:21:23.159" style="s2">to be the winner now if it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:24.929" style="s2">catastrophic win I mean if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.159" end="00:21:26.730" style="s2">extinguish it if I don&#39;t kill you if</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.929" end="00:21:28.830" style="s2">you&#39;re still in the game then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.730" end="00:21:30.210" style="s2">really strong incentive to be very</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.830" end="00:21:32.789" style="s2">exploratory and try to figure out some</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.210" end="00:21:34.440" style="s2">novel way to write around me and we see</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.789" end="00:21:36.090" style="s2">this happening for example in capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.440" end="00:21:37.710" style="s2">this is one of the virtues of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.090" end="00:21:40.380" style="s2">it uses this mechanism to drive</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:41.820" style="s2">innovation yeah so if my company I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.380" end="00:21:43.890" style="s2">competes your company your company the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.820" end="00:21:45.480" style="s2">eyes are is going out of business or it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.890" end="00:21:47.100" style="s2">has to be more innovative well what that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.480" end="00:21:48.750" style="s2">does is that is what pushes us along the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.100" end="00:21:51.270" style="s2">innovation curve so increases the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.750" end="00:21:53.909" style="s2">exponential increases the rate of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.270" end="00:21:57.320" style="s2">exponential now all is well and good</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.909" end="00:21:59.640" style="s2">except for a couple of things one is as</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.320" end="00:22:01.110" style="s2">we&#39;re engaging in conflict with each</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.640" end="00:22:03.059" style="s2">other we&#39;re creating some set of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.110" end="00:22:05.070" style="s2">externalities and we&#39;re producing some</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.059" end="00:22:08.010" style="s2">kind of waste energy into the system it</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.070" end="00:22:09.779" style="s2">might be that just the simple act of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.010" end="00:22:11.780" style="s2">producing goods and services generates</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.779" end="00:22:16.100" style="s2">pollution and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.780" end="00:22:19.660" style="s2">or it may be that how I market my</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.100" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">product into the marketplace creates a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.660" end="00:22:23.510" style="s2">jams the sense-making systems the human</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:24.530" style="s2">beings used to figure out what a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.510" end="00:22:25.910" style="s2">choices for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.530" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter like fill in the blank</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.910" end="00:22:30.410" style="s2">there&#39;s some nonzero externality that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">produced and you kind of multiply that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.410" end="00:22:34.630" style="s2">by the power the magnitude of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:37.220" style="s2">doing so if what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.630" end="00:22:39.170" style="s2">gathering sticks to create fire that has</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.220" end="00:22:40.700" style="s2">one level of externality if what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.170" end="00:22:42.290" style="s2">doing is nuclear power that has another</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.700" end="00:22:44.900" style="s2">level of externality it&#39;s much larger</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.290" end="00:22:47.210" style="s2">and potentially very significant well</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.900" end="00:22:50.030" style="s2">what moving along the exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.210" end="00:22:52.610" style="s2">curve means is increasing our power so</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.030" end="00:22:54.200" style="s2">as we move further and further to up the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.610" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">curve which we have to because of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.200" end="00:22:57.860" style="s2">competitive dynamic one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:22:59.600" style="s2">that we intrinsically do is when</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.860" end="00:23:00.650" style="s2">increase the risks associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.600" end="00:23:02.900" style="s2">magnitude of power that we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.650" end="00:23:05.990" style="s2">with so for example very concretely</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.900" end="00:23:08.450" style="s2">right now we&#39;re in a situation where say</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.990" end="00:23:10.940" style="s2">CRISPR casts nine has taken the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.450" end="00:23:13.010" style="s2">nightmares of germ and genetic warfare</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.940" end="00:23:14.060" style="s2">that were just nightmares in the 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.010" end="00:23:16.790" style="s2">like in the nineteen seventies we had</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.060" end="00:23:19.610" style="s2">this concern that we might engineer</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.659" end="00:24:32.960" style="s2">we&#39;re in a situation where for the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.980" end="00:24:34.340" style="s2">time in the history of history we did in</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.779" end="00:24:48.230" style="s2">problem so we qualitatively shifted from</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.090" end="00:24:49.639" style="s2">one place where we couldn&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.230" end="00:24:52.429" style="s2">hurt ourselves to a place where we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.639" end="00:24:54.500" style="s2">but still it was a relatively easy thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.429" end="00:24:56.149" style="s2">to do and we barely made it and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.500" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">barely made it past that threshold and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.149" end="00:24:59.510" style="s2">now what&#39;s happening is that as removing</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:01.460" style="s2">that up that exponential curve the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.510" end="00:25:03.260" style="s2">magnitude of power continues to increase</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.460" end="00:25:05.090" style="s2">becomes decentralized it gets pushed</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.260" end="00:25:07.639" style="s2">further and further out to more and more</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.639" end="00:25:10.730" style="s2">therefore we&#39;re moving into a state</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:13.460" style="s2">where in the not-too-distant future</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.730" end="00:25:16.789" style="s2">effectively everybody is going to have</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:22.970" style="s2">so it&#39;s another curve and so the point</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.659" end="00:25:24.740" style="s2">is that we&#39;ve got a lot of curves and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.970" end="00:25:27.320" style="s2">can actually take very small curves like</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.740" end="00:25:29.330" style="s2">the Hubble curve with with oil reserves</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.320" end="00:25:31.789" style="s2">we took a bigger curves like the Tainter</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.330" end="00:25:33.380" style="s2">curve the brightest Ida Smith model or</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.789" end="00:25:35.110" style="s2">we can look at a fundamental curve like</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.380" end="00:25:37.490" style="s2">this relationship between game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.110" end="00:25:38.840" style="s2">rivalries dynamics and exponential</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.490" end="00:25:40.909" style="s2">technology and how that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.840" end="00:25:42.590" style="s2">fragility but all of these are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.909" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">pointing in the same direction which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.590" end="00:25:46.820" style="s2">that there&#39;s something about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:48.820" style="s2">of how we do civilization now that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.820" end="00:25:51.260" style="s2">leading us to a circumstance where</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.820" end="00:25:53.330" style="s2">fragility is being built into the system</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.260" end="00:25:55.880" style="s2">in many many different layers and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.330" end="00:25:57.500" style="s2">also talked about the the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.880" end="00:26:00.230" style="s2">dialogue is going the increased</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.500" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">polarization of the dialogue is is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.230" end="00:26:03.470" style="s2">where we&#39;re staking out ideological</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:05.899" style="s2">positions that are very difficult for us</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.470" end="00:26:09.710" style="s2">to to communicate with the other side</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.899" end="00:26:11.419" style="s2">well this is both a cause and a symptom</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.710" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">so let&#39;s take a look at it from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.419" end="00:26:19.370" style="s2">point of view of being a cause</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:22.490" style="s2">easy enough right if I in playing a</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.029" end="00:26:55.870" style="s2">is to create a strong and bound group</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.409" end="00:26:57.610" style="s2">that has a natural antipathy to some</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.419" end="00:27:06.639" style="s2">happens is is that it&#39;ll sort of tend to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.610" end="00:27:09.370" style="s2">orbit around 50% on either side because</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.639" end="00:27:11.169" style="s2">that&#39;s power shifts back and forth but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.370" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">then it will tend to polarize because</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.169" end="00:27:15.190" style="s2">that&#39;s just the natural dynamics that if</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.509" end="00:29:50.830" style="s2">consequences so the the legacy media</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.509" end="00:29:51.970" style="s2">infrastructure and by the way when I say</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.830" end="00:29:55.389" style="s2">media infrastructure I literally mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.970" end="00:29:57.100" style="s2">the way that as a group as a society we</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.389" end="00:29:58.629" style="s2">are able to collectively make sense of</p>

<p begin="00:29:58.629" end="00:30:04.179" style="s2">inform ourselves about what choices to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.639" end="00:30:06.249" style="s2">make so it used to be broadcast still is</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.249" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">my broadcast I mean something like some</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.610" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">or it&#39;s a newscaster broadcasting over</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.529" end="00:30:26.139" style="s2">television there&#39;s this relationship of</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.139" end="00:30:29.409" style="s2">listeners and a sin and no inter</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.090" end="00:30:30.850" style="s2">communication right so even if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.409" end="00:30:34.289" style="s2">listening even ask questions I could</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.850" end="00:30:36.429" style="s2">just listen and as a modality of</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.429" end="00:30:41.350" style="s2">this has certain effectiveness if you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.730" end="00:30:43.330" style="s2">a very very good job of empowering the</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.899" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">you give them the speaker they speak and</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:30:59.190" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.910" end="00:31:04.530" style="s2">we can go into your like some into some</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.700" end="00:31:41.700" style="s2">to climb the ladder on being credentials</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:43.650" style="s2">so you get to be the one to speak right</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.700" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">that&#39;s what success looks like they met</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.650" end="00:31:48.419" style="s2">the kind of psychological model that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:50.070" style="s2">you&#39;ll develop as a human most of the</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.070" end="00:31:53.490" style="s2">and you can&#39;t ride that elevator and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.530" end="00:31:56.460" style="s2">you end up with a self reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.490" end="00:31:58.770" style="s2">system or the topology of the overall</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.460" end="00:32:00.419" style="s2">media constructs this dynamic and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.770" end="00:32:02.190" style="s2">the developmental psychology constructs</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.419" end="00:32:03.450" style="s2">people who are adapted to that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.190" end="00:32:04.280" style="s2">environment so they reinforce it on</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.450" end="00:32:07.289" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.280" end="00:32:09.480" style="s2">now you shift obviously for the past 20</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.289" end="00:32:10.590" style="s2">years in an accelerating curve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.480" end="00:32:12.600" style="s2">been moving into a completely different</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:33.380" style="s2">different nature it&#39;s more like our</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.330" end="00:32:35.909" style="s2">conversation I speak in this case more</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.380" end="00:32:36.870" style="s2">you speak to the right needle to ask</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.909" end="00:32:37.950" style="s2">questions you can direct the</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.510" end="00:32:47.580" style="s2">power and it also requires a different</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.020" end="00:32:49.500" style="s2">adaptive behavior right so we can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.580" end="00:32:51.150" style="s2">get into that in a bit and what that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.500" end="00:32:52.200" style="s2">looks like but the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.150" end="00:32:54.390" style="s2">calling at is the fact we&#39;re in the</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.090" end="00:33:13.140" style="s2">all over the place and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.040" end="00:33:14.400" style="s2">struggling it&#39;s just of conflict it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.400" end="00:33:18.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a conflict of at the level of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.950" end="00:33:20.670" style="s2">kind of psychologists are adaptive is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.660" end="00:33:23.510" style="s2">the comfort to the level of who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.670" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">speak and therefore the messages are</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:29.250" style="s2">place and of course this is chaos and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.540" end="00:33:31.620" style="s2">and then we get kind of cycle back to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.250" end="00:33:34.230" style="s2">maybe the Trump phenomenon that when</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.620" end="00:33:35.640" style="s2">chaos emerges the particular approaches</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.640" end="00:33:38.790" style="s2">will tend to be more successful that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.380" end="00:33:41.460" style="s2">approaches that are better at playing in</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.790" end="00:33:43.500" style="s2">order for example in a celebrated essay</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.460" end="00:33:46.470" style="s2">for medium after the Trump election of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.500" end="00:33:49.380" style="s2">2016 Green Hall described how a new</p>

<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:05.460" style="s2">at well so since we have a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.850" end="00:34:07.040" style="s2">opportunity to be more explicit I want</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.460" end="00:34:12.600" style="s2">to make sure to break a few things out</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.040" end="00:34:14.190" style="s2">so identified a couple of distinct let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.600" end="00:34:16.950" style="s2">call them entities they may not</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.190" end="00:34:18.690" style="s2">necessarily be self-consciously</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.090" end="00:34:32.130" style="s2">so there is at least three one I&#39;m going</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.450" end="00:35:21.150" style="s2">establishment you have a group of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.500" end="00:35:22.500" style="s2">individuals who have any relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.150" end="00:35:24.450" style="s2">with each other that are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.500" end="00:35:27.240" style="s2">tightly connected and as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.450" end="00:35:28.890" style="s2">are want to do tend to relate in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.240" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">fashion which is coordinated with each</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.890" end="00:35:32.310" style="s2">other they have similar sensibilities</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.390" style="s2">they have similar values they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.310" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">like each other because they&#39;re friends</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.390" end="00:35:37.110" style="s2">they hang out in the same places and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:38.700" style="s2">they kind of coordinate and work</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.110" end="00:35:39.870" style="s2">together they certainly influence each</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.700" end="00:35:40.950" style="s2">other enormous because you can only</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.870" end="00:35:42.930" style="s2">listen to so many people</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.950" end="00:35:46.460" style="s2">and you really care about people who are</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.930" end="00:35:51.540" style="s2">socially connected right so if your</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.460" end="00:35:55.700" style="s2">sisters husband is the current head of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.540" end="00:35:58.950" style="s2">NBC and you&#39;re the current head of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.700" end="00:35:59.910" style="s2">Harvard then he&#39;s gonna care what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.950" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">think you&#39;re gonna care what he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.910" end="00:36:03.150" style="s2">because your in-laws and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:04.290" style="s2">you&#39;re both in established positions of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.150" end="00:36:05.640" style="s2">authority which means that you have high</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.290" end="00:36:07.729" style="s2">credentials to be important right so</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.640" end="00:36:10.529" style="s2">that&#39;s just the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.729" end="00:36:12.539" style="s2">the second is the deep state alright the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.529" end="00:36:14.569" style="s2">deep state which is astounding me which</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.539" end="00:36:17.190" style="s2">is I think what five seven years ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.569" end="00:36:18.539" style="s2">that would have been almost nobody would</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.190" end="00:36:20.249" style="s2">have had that language in that concept</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.539" end="00:36:22.619" style="s2">and now almost everybody does which is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.249" end="00:36:25.859" style="s2">good indication that this something is</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.619" end="00:36:27.059" style="s2">happening right the deep state is kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.859" end="00:36:28.469" style="s2">of playing out the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.059" end="00:36:31.049" style="s2">narrative but now talking about it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.469" end="00:36:34.739" style="s2">the terms of institutional structures so</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.049" end="00:36:36.839" style="s2">if I&#39;m a lifer at the CIA and you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.739" end="00:36:38.609" style="s2">lifer at the FBI there&#39;s some likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.839" end="00:36:40.769" style="s2">that we have interacted with each other</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.609" end="00:36:44.009" style="s2">more than one or two times during our</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.769" end="00:36:46.709" style="s2">time frame and if she&#39;s alive for at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.009" end="00:36:49.109" style="s2">IRS then that happens too right so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.709" end="00:36:51.299" style="s2">same basic idea there&#39;s a continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.109" end="00:36:53.219" style="s2">relationship where I have beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.299" end="00:36:55.979" style="s2">build sort of an institutional loyalty</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.219" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">to a set of what is this local culture</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.979" end="00:36:59.999" style="s2">the CIA as a culture the FBI has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.529" style="s2">culture the US military has a culture</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.999" end="00:37:02.819" style="s2">has many different cultures and by the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.529" end="00:37:04.349" style="s2">way all the corporations that have</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.819" end="00:37:06.390" style="s2">military industrial or government</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.349" end="00:37:08.670" style="s2">relationships do - right so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.390" end="00:37:10.229" style="s2">thirty year exactly to the next song but</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.670" end="00:37:11.549" style="s2">I&#39;ve also done five stints at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.229" end="00:37:12.209" style="s2">Department of Energy because that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.549" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">it works</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.209" end="00:37:16.529" style="s2">these things begin to bind alright so</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:17.789" style="s2">that forms its own relationship you got</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.529" end="00:37:19.170" style="s2">the establishment you got the deep state</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.789" end="00:37:21.839" style="s2">they&#39;re very connected but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.170" end="00:37:23.069" style="s2">exactly the same thing and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.839" end="00:37:24.449" style="s2">there are many other structures that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.069" end="00:37:27.059" style="s2">in the environment as well those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.449" end="00:37:29.099" style="s2">the only two then you&#39;ve got the deep</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.059" end="00:37:30.449" style="s2">church and the deep church to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.099" end="00:37:31.529" style="s2">conceptualize that you have to think</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.449" end="00:37:34.380" style="s2">about it at a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.529" end="00:37:37.859" style="s2">abstraction it&#39;s more of a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.380" end="00:37:39.329" style="s2">type and a way of being and doing which</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.859" end="00:37:41.789" style="s2">I described earlier but to recapitulate</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.329" end="00:37:43.229" style="s2">there&#39;s a notion of there being some</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.789" end="00:37:46.499" style="s2">very small number of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.229" end="00:37:48.509" style="s2">authorized speakers the nature of speech</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.499" end="00:37:51.299" style="s2">goes from small number to almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.509" end="00:37:54.059" style="s2">everybody large broadcast and it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.299" end="00:37:55.529" style="s2">way there&#39;s no interactivity and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.059" end="00:37:57.380" style="s2">become credencial eyes as an authorized</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.529" end="00:37:59.549" style="s2">speaker is a very powerful place to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.380" end="00:38:00.690" style="s2">model you can either get that by being a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.549" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">member of the establishment in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.690" end="00:38:06.420" style="s2">state or by being a celebrity which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:08.969" style="s2">an odd artifact of broadcast media so</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.420" end="00:38:13.859" style="s2">that complex those three together hang</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.969" end="00:38:15.839" style="s2">together more or less loosely as this</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.859" end="00:38:17.400" style="s2">phenomenon right so it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.839" end="00:38:18.869" style="s2">blue church but now if we want to refer</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.400" end="00:38:20.309" style="s2">to all of that as the blue church we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.869" end="00:38:20.650" style="s2">but just be mindful and I said the blue</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.309" end="00:38:22.630" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.650" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">is more of the the process that gives</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.630" end="00:38:26.799" style="s2">rise to a particular way of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:33.640" style="s2">and making choices and reinforcing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.799" end="00:38:35.799" style="s2">as a social field so then in in contrast</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.640" end="00:38:40.119" style="s2">to that this emergent dynamic this new</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.799" end="00:38:43.329" style="s2">phenomenon so I I characterize that as</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.119" end="00:38:45.279" style="s2">differentially as the insurgency and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.329" end="00:38:47.319" style="s2">also as the red religion and then also</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.279" end="00:38:49.000" style="s2">as the decentralized medium so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.319" end="00:38:50.980" style="s2">take it as two peers think about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.000" end="00:38:52.750" style="s2">blue church that Matt&#39;s - the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.980" end="00:38:54.730" style="s2">decentralized medium so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.750" end="00:38:57.130" style="s2">different media topology and different</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.730" end="00:38:59.529" style="s2">psychological typology that gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.130" end="00:39:00.579" style="s2">to different abilities to send in to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.529" end="00:39:01.779" style="s2">tell stories and different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.579" end="00:39:03.549" style="s2">stories that are going to be upregulated</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.779" end="00:39:05.250" style="s2">mean magic</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.549" end="00:39:08.920" style="s2">all right meme magic is over here</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.250" end="00:39:10.930" style="s2">talking heads and classic propaganda is</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.920" end="00:39:12.309" style="s2">over here meme magic is over here and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.930" end="00:39:14.020" style="s2">they very different and how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.309" end="00:39:18.279" style="s2">shaped and who shapes them and how they</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.020" end="00:39:20.680" style="s2">show up now under here the deep state</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.279" end="00:39:22.809" style="s2">and the establishment have optimized for</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.680" end="00:39:24.490" style="s2">the blue church right there that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.809" end="00:39:27.010" style="s2">you&#39;re successful is to become the ones</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.490" end="00:39:28.539" style="s2">who have the ability to speak to become</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.010" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">the ones who have credentials and become</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.539" end="00:39:32.710" style="s2">the ones who have control over other</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:36.190" style="s2">kinds of broadcast style bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.710" end="00:39:37.240" style="s2">institutions like pass the EPA small</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.190" end="00:39:40.049" style="s2">current people get to pass the law</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.240" end="00:39:43.660" style="s2">everybody has to follow the law over</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.049" end="00:39:45.400" style="s2">here we have chaos we have a new niche</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.660" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">that has opened up and nobody has</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.400" end="00:39:48.789" style="s2">figured out how to master it perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:51.069" style="s2">so now it&#39;s wide open now it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.789" end="00:39:52.180" style="s2">that if you&#39;re doing this well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.069" end="00:39:54.520" style="s2">not gonna play that game why would you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.180" end="00:39:55.569" style="s2">play a new game if the old game works</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.520" end="00:39:57.400" style="s2">really well and you&#39;re the expert at</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.569" end="00:39:58.510" style="s2">your control of this game so the people</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.400" end="00:40:00.910" style="s2">who over here are kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.510" end="00:40:02.529" style="s2">heterogeneous or the marginal in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.910" end="00:40:05.279" style="s2">case the losers are the last culture war</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.529" end="00:40:08.440" style="s2">which is broadly the the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.279" end="00:40:11.650" style="s2">conservatives and so one way of naming</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.440" end="00:40:14.349" style="s2">the alt-right which is semantically</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.650" end="00:40:15.819" style="s2">confusing which is to say the people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.349" end="00:40:19.390" style="s2">originally coined the term the alt-right</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.819" end="00:40:22.150" style="s2">are one group the way the alt-right is</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.390" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">presented in this blue church narrative</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.150" end="00:40:27.010" style="s2">is another one i&#39;m about to present a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:28.119" style="s2">third and maybe problematic because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.010" end="00:40:31.420" style="s2">going to be confusing but the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.119" end="00:40:33.860" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s the way that these</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.420" end="00:40:35.540" style="s2">particular characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.860" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">conservativism add a little of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.540" end="00:40:40.610" style="s2">personality type and a level of core</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:44.510" style="s2">values have begun to discover and Rico</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.610" end="00:40:46.700" style="s2">here on this new framework or we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.510" end="00:40:48.170" style="s2">just call it the insurgency and this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.700" end="00:40:49.940" style="s2">the new right the new group of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.170" end="00:40:51.110" style="s2">individuals and institutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.940" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">forming over here that are very</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.110" end="00:40:58.130" style="s2">different and they&#39;re just a different</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:41:02.420" style="s2">set of sensibilities so now where are we</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.130" end="00:41:05.030" style="s2">on that process I articulated this</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.420" end="00:41:06.620" style="s2">narrative I guess right after the 2016</p>

<p begin="00:41:09.350" end="00:41:12.710" style="s2">notably right after the election and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.790" end="00:41:14.570" style="s2">described it in terms of here&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.710" end="00:41:16.670" style="s2">of fronts of what we might think of as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.570" end="00:41:18.170" style="s2">war they&#39;re gonna be playing out there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.670" end="00:41:19.730" style="s2">the front at the level of the mass media</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.170" end="00:41:21.470" style="s2">there&#39;s the front of the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.730" end="00:41:22.940" style="s2">deep state there&#39;s a front to the level</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.470" end="00:41:24.530" style="s2">of globalism and there&#39;s the front of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.940" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">the most fundamental level which is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.530" end="00:41:28.460" style="s2">conflict between how we do collective</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.460" end="00:41:34.040" style="s2">decentralized style and honestly I feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.150" end="00:41:39.290" style="s2">like the things that played out pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.040" end="00:41:42.770" style="s2">much as described first the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.290" end="00:41:44.360" style="s2">both formally through the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.770" end="00:41:46.280" style="s2">administration and informally through</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.360" end="00:41:48.080" style="s2">the kind of cluster of human beings who</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.280" end="00:41:50.630" style="s2">are gathering under this new medium have</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.080" end="00:41:53.050" style="s2">overtly identified the mass media as</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.630" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">fake news I literally to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.050" end="00:41:58.010" style="s2">which in the cost I think recently you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:41:59.690" style="s2">yelled while you you know when will you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.010" end="00:42:00.620" style="s2">stop asking the American people to call</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.690" end="00:42:02.780" style="s2">us the enemy of the people or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.620" end="00:42:04.790" style="s2">happens to be right since now we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.780" end="00:42:07.750" style="s2">on the point where it is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.790" end="00:42:10.370" style="s2">consciousness that the mass media is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.750" end="00:42:11.390" style="s2">enemy now you may agree with it or not</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.370" end="00:42:12.830" style="s2">agree with it but it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.390" end="00:42:16.430" style="s2">consciousness right and a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.830" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">wasn&#39;t 5 10 15 years ago I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.430" end="00:42:19.970" style="s2">in some level Rush Limbaugh has been</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:23.510" style="s2">saying this for a while but now it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.970" end="00:42:25.490" style="s2">the narrative and I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.510" end="00:42:27.560" style="s2">recent poll showed that something like</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.490" end="00:42:29.270" style="s2">75 percent of Americans believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.560" end="00:42:32.660" style="s2">media is engaged in either over at</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.270" end="00:42:34.820" style="s2">manipulation or reckless propaganda so</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.660" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s sunk in and we should just say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.820" end="00:42:39.830" style="s2">these structures aren&#39;t decreasing Lee</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:41.600" style="s2">credible and their effectiveness is I</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.830" end="00:42:44.090" style="s2">think rather obviously becoming less and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.600" end="00:42:46.190" style="s2">less trite has less distraction so</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.090" end="00:42:47.360" style="s2">that&#39;s one front and I expect that to</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.190" end="00:42:48.830" style="s2">continue to accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.360" end="00:42:51.710" style="s2">because I&#39;ve noticed that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.830" end="00:42:53.000" style="s2">really abysmal strategic sense so they</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.710" end="00:42:55.070" style="s2">keep to just they seem to keep punching</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.000" end="00:42:58.100" style="s2">themselves in the face and I expect them</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.070" end="00:43:00.440" style="s2">to keep doing so so let&#39;s kind of check</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.100" end="00:43:02.300" style="s2">the natural drift is away from mass</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.440" end="00:43:03.590" style="s2">media to decentralized media anyway</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.300" end="00:43:05.450" style="s2">because the technological technological</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.590" end="00:43:07.730" style="s2">shift is going there and we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.450" end="00:43:10.930" style="s2">seeing it happen at the level of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.730" end="00:43:13.640" style="s2">psychological attention and credibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.930" end="00:43:15.830" style="s2">so then the second layer is the layer</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.640" end="00:43:17.600" style="s2">between the deep state and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.830" end="00:43:20.030" style="s2">insurgency and of course this is also</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.600" end="00:43:21.860" style="s2">playing out right we&#39;ve seen the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.030" end="00:43:23.810" style="s2">conflict happening at the at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.860" end="00:43:25.760" style="s2">the FBI we&#39;ve also seen it playing out</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.810" end="00:43:27.710" style="s2">in the DOJ and the State Department all</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.760" end="00:43:28.820" style="s2">those sort of usual suspects I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.710" end="00:43:30.380" style="s2">think we have much of this ability of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.820" end="00:43:33.470" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and say the CIA or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.380" end="00:43:35.810" style="s2">NSA that&#39;s because their secret but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.470" end="00:43:38.810" style="s2">seems pretty evident that a conflict is</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.810" end="00:43:41.150" style="s2">occurring that is between what we would</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.810" end="00:43:43.340" style="s2">very clearly identify as the deep state</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.150" end="00:43:45.380" style="s2">the people who are in the highest levels</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.340" end="00:43:46.550" style="s2">of some of the primary institutions</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.380" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">particular the level of law enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.550" end="00:43:49.910" style="s2">and investigation which we have I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:52.790" style="s2">going to try to decapitate the deep</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.910" end="00:43:54.140" style="s2">state that&#39;s where I&#39;d start and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.790" end="00:43:57.830" style="s2">more or less being successful right</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.140" end="00:43:59.420" style="s2">they&#39;re beginning to be moved out and of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.830" end="00:44:01.850" style="s2">course the deep state is deep and is</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.420" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">large and it&#39;s powerful so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.850" end="00:44:05.690" style="s2">that we can call that one just yet but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:08.840" style="s2">would say right now that if I had to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.690" end="00:44:11.560" style="s2">estimate it is substantially further</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.840" end="00:44:14.930" style="s2">along in the was like the soccer game</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.560" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">World Cup so the insurgency is ahead 2</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.930" end="00:44:21.530" style="s2">to 0 2 to nil and we&#39;re probably the 75</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:23.660" style="s2">minute mark so the TVA&#39;s gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.530" end="00:44:24.620" style="s2">start innovating quite significantly if</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.660" end="00:44:26.120" style="s2">they want to figure out how to make up</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.620" end="00:44:27.860" style="s2">that lost ground and reestablish</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.120" end="00:44:29.270" style="s2">themselves and part of the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.860" end="00:44:33.290" style="s2">course is that the deep state is seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.270" end="00:44:36.650" style="s2">to have been unwisely continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.290" end="00:44:39.950" style="s2">believe that its ability to control the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.650" end="00:44:41.300" style="s2">mass media is a powerful lever is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.950" end="00:44:44.330" style="s2">recognizing that&#39;s in fact punching</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.300" end="00:44:45.890" style="s2">itself in the face by doing that and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.330" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t realize that it hasn&#39;t got the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.890" end="00:44:50.270" style="s2">right doodle-loop the ability to respond</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:52.520" style="s2">quickly to changes in the game and so it</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.270" end="00:44:55.880" style="s2">just keeps executing on old strategies</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.520" end="00:44:58.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like the the apocryphal Polish</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.880" end="00:45:00.570" style="s2">cavalry charging the German</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.380" end="00:45:02.370" style="s2">yeah Kaveri will used to kick ass we get</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.570" end="00:45:06.510" style="s2">it it&#39;s not gonna work in this war the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.370" end="00:45:07.620" style="s2">war is change so I continue to expect</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.510" end="00:45:12.600" style="s2">that the insurgency will win this</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.620" end="00:45:15.360" style="s2">conflict now but not massive maybe 60%</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.600" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">probability then the Third Front which</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.360" end="00:45:21.980" style="s2">is the the front that shows up as the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:26.610" style="s2">new nationalism reverses globalism again</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.980" end="00:45:27.630" style="s2">same basic idea it&#39;s clearly a front and</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.610" end="00:45:29.850" style="s2">I think that&#39;s pretty straight forward</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.630" end="00:45:34.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s clearly progressing in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.850" end="00:45:38.370" style="s2">direction and Italy and the EU continues</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.680" end="00:45:41.430" style="s2">to have chunks of the EU shift from at</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.370" end="00:45:43.620" style="s2">least EU European which in fact is</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.430" end="00:45:46.110" style="s2">actually also globalist to nationalists</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.620" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">and that seems to be accelerating that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.110" end="00:45:51.480" style="s2">decelerating I mean look the palm didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:53.730" style="s2">win in France but she did almost right</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.480" end="00:45:56.820" style="s2">she got in the zone I think Merkel is</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.730" end="00:45:58.350" style="s2">right now you know challenged so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.820" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">energy seems to continue to be moving in</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.350" end="00:46:01.860" style="s2">the direction of some new form of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:04.110" style="s2">nationalism which is contra globalism</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.860" end="00:46:06.570" style="s2">and of course since the United States</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.110" end="00:46:08.100" style="s2">has been the primary agent of globalism</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.570" end="00:46:10.530" style="s2">to the degree to which the United States</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.100" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">is now moving in the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.530" end="00:46:14.910" style="s2">direction that&#39;s really tough like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:16.500" style="s2">globalist institutions don&#39;t have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.910" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">of ability to enforce themselves on</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.500" end="00:46:20.970" style="s2">national institutions absent the ability</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:22.170" style="s2">to actually control the national</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.970" end="00:46:28.710" style="s2">institution national institutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.170" end="00:46:30.900" style="s2">directly so barring some scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.710" end="00:46:32.610" style="s2">things are more odd than they seem which</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.900" end="00:46:33.660" style="s2">is plausible I mean certainly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.610" end="00:46:37.470" style="s2">many many possible scenarios I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.660" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">describing one that one is going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.470" end="00:46:40.620" style="s2">continue to basically be derivative of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:42.300" style="s2">the first two with a vector in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.620" end="00:46:44.550" style="s2">direction away from globalism and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.300" end="00:46:46.920" style="s2">towards increasing multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.550" end="00:46:47.850" style="s2">nationalism and then the last which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.920" end="00:46:50.520" style="s2">the most important and the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.850" end="00:46:52.170" style="s2">fundamental by far which is the shift of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.520" end="00:46:53.850" style="s2">the balance of power from the media</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.170" end="00:46:56.130" style="s2">structures of broadcast in the blue</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.850" end="00:46:58.820" style="s2">church to this new set of media</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.130" end="00:47:01.950" style="s2">structures that are decentralized and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.820" end="00:47:03.270" style="s2">again that continues to move we talked</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.950" end="00:47:05.850" style="s2">about the idea I mentioned there&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.270" end="00:47:07.200" style="s2">meme magic that has moved from being a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.850" end="00:47:08.580" style="s2">thing that a very small group of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.200" end="00:47:10.500" style="s2">individuals used almost tongue-in-cheek</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.580" end="00:47:11.490" style="s2">to a thing that I think almost becoming</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.500" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">a discipline</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.490" end="00:47:15.570" style="s2">a guy would not be surprised to see like</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:17.060" style="s2">a university course on me magic anytime</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.570" end="00:47:21.560" style="s2">soon</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.060" end="00:47:24.840" style="s2">or at least an online online course and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.560" end="00:47:26.730" style="s2">that makes sense because just everyday</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.840" end="00:47:28.410" style="s2">more and more attention just straight-up</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.730" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">attention is moved to this new framework</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.410" end="00:47:35.430" style="s2">and more and more people are we&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:37.800" style="s2">deep visceral level that the styles and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.430" end="00:47:39.300" style="s2">approaches and people that are most</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.800" end="00:47:42.930" style="s2">fundamentally associate with the blue</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.300" end="00:47:44.340" style="s2">church don&#39;t work lost for lots of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.930" end="00:47:48.710" style="s2">reasons like they don&#39;t feel like they</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.340" end="00:47:52.050" style="s2">work they feel incompetent or</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.710" end="00:47:53.940" style="s2">inauthentic and these new voices</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.050" end="00:47:57.690" style="s2">I think you&#39;ve talked a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.940" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">intellectual dark web are showing up</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.690" end="00:48:01.500" style="s2">almost surprisingly but they&#39;re showing</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:03.390" style="s2">up surprising it for this reason which</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.500" end="00:48:05.190" style="s2">is it there there&#39;s a new possibility</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.390" end="00:48:09.570" style="s2">because it effectively what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.190" end="00:48:12.270" style="s2">is the breakdown the breakdown of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.570" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">ideological structure yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.270" end="00:48:20.040" style="s2">that says there&#39;s actually a really hard</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:21.840" style="s2">question so let me see if I can yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.040" end="00:48:28.200" style="s2">think she&#39;s got out so let me see if I</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.840" end="00:48:32.609" style="s2">can try to articulate it well well see</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.200" end="00:48:35.100" style="s2">so we talked about the way that the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.609" end="00:48:36.480" style="s2">broadcast works the way that feels this</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.100" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">just used actually school schools a nice</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.480" end="00:48:41.400" style="s2">example cuz everybody&#39;s most people have</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:43.230" style="s2">been in school so the way the broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.400" end="00:48:46.760" style="s2">works is there&#39;s there&#39;s a person an</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.230" end="00:48:49.740" style="s2">authority and that authority has two</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.760" end="00:48:52.050" style="s2">primary characteristics one is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.740" end="00:48:53.310" style="s2">the one who gets to speak and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.050" end="00:48:56.090" style="s2">the one who knows what the right answers</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.310" end="00:48:58.770" style="s2">are and so they hold good opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.090" end="00:49:00.180" style="s2">they commit and their job is to convey</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.770" end="00:49:01.890" style="s2">good and good opinions you just share</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.180" end="00:49:05.430" style="s2">with you what is in fact the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.890" end="00:49:08.040" style="s2">to think and your job the audience the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.430" end="00:49:09.780" style="s2">student is to learn and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.040" end="00:49:15.960" style="s2">deploy good opinion whatever it may be</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.780" end="00:49:17.670" style="s2">right now in a very well functioning</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.960" end="00:49:21.810" style="s2">version of this good opinion includes</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.670" end="00:49:26.120" style="s2">critical thinking but it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.810" end="00:49:28.860" style="s2">weird dynamic where the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.120" end="00:49:30.300" style="s2">the part of the brain the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.860" end="00:49:32.670" style="s2">are actually interacting with the brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.300" end="00:49:36.300" style="s2">that is associated with this style of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.670" end="00:49:38.790" style="s2">information transfer is dissonant with</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.300" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">critical thinking so it&#39;s like do as I</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.790" end="00:49:44.010" style="s2">say not as I do think critically think</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:47.370" style="s2">critically what did I just tell you to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.010" end="00:49:49.230" style="s2">do think critically right I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.370" end="00:49:50.910" style="s2">training what I&#39;m actually training to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.230" end="00:49:52.650" style="s2">do is not to think critically regardless</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.910" end="00:49:54.180" style="s2">of how much I say that I am in fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.650" end="00:49:55.290" style="s2">regardless of how much information I</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.180" end="00:49:56.550" style="s2">convey to you about how to think</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.290" end="00:49:58.320" style="s2">critically right the way you learn how</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.550" end="00:50:00.180" style="s2">to think critically is not by being</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.320" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">taught then how to think critically by</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.180" end="00:50:04.200" style="s2">thinking critically in reality in</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:06.270" style="s2">practice and learning how to really feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.200" end="00:50:08.730" style="s2">in yourself when does something feel off</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.270" end="00:50:10.560" style="s2">and okay what&#39;s uncertainty and feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.730" end="00:50:12.690" style="s2">okay with them certainty but our actual</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.560" end="00:50:14.250" style="s2">academic environment and say under the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.690" end="00:50:16.050" style="s2">regime of standardized tests as an</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.250" end="00:50:17.490" style="s2">example under the regime of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.050" end="00:50:19.290" style="s2">competitive landscape to be the one or</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.490" end="00:50:20.670" style="s2">two people who get to go to the good</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.290" end="00:50:23.610" style="s2">college they can get the good job like</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.670" end="00:50:25.230" style="s2">this so under the like the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.610" end="00:50:27.510" style="s2">the way the education is operated in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.230" end="00:50:30.750" style="s2">States the regime of standardized tests</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.510" end="00:50:32.250" style="s2">so we we want to be able to be sure that</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.750" end="00:50:34.380" style="s2">the school is doing a good job so we</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.250" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">create a test and with that it does of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.380" end="00:50:37.380" style="s2">course as it begins to make it so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:39.240" style="s2">students want to optimize against that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.380" end="00:50:41.310" style="s2">test particular the test has color like</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.240" end="00:50:42.540" style="s2">the SAT where you have to get a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.310" end="00:50:43.650" style="s2">score on the SAT if you want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.540" end="00:50:44.760" style="s2">a good college and if you get a good</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.640" end="00:50:53.250" style="s2">and to be a good person kind of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.360" end="00:50:54.420" style="s2">the story so this creates a gradient</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.250" end="00:50:56.730" style="s2">right it Chris competitive landscape</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.420" end="00:50:58.260" style="s2">where you have to optimize against what</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.730" end="00:51:00.540" style="s2">are the characteristics necessary to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.260" end="00:51:03.570" style="s2">well in these various in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.540" end="00:51:06.360" style="s2">simple tests well there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.570" end="00:51:08.700" style="s2">style of brain style of mind or you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.360" end="00:51:10.650" style="s2">to be able to very quickly and with high</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.700" end="00:51:13.550" style="s2">fidelity be able to access information</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.550" end="00:51:17.670" style="s2">effectively all right it&#39;s computational</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.670" end="00:51:21.420" style="s2">and information processing mind isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.950" end="00:51:22.950" style="s2">the same kind of mind is able to do say</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.630" end="00:51:27.990" style="s2">many people who have criticized</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.550" end="00:51:31.470" style="s2">education have been pointing this out</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.990" end="00:51:33.290" style="s2">this is not me in any way so when we use</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.470" end="00:51:35.130" style="s2">the concept we use the term ideology</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.290" end="00:51:38.370" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to propose is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.130" end="00:51:39.150" style="s2">ideology is nothing but a pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.370" end="00:51:41.610" style="s2">manifold</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.150" end="00:51:44.700" style="s2">information that somebody somewhere not</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.610" end="00:51:47.730" style="s2">you has largely constructed and has been</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.700" end="00:51:50.340" style="s2">presented to you as a preformed menu and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.730" end="00:51:52.740" style="s2">it&#39;s some list of stuff that Orient&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.340" end="00:51:55.590" style="s2">what is right and true and your job is</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.740" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">to receive it Shh figure out where you</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.590" end="00:51:58.560" style="s2">are on that list and then choose</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.880" end="00:52:03.060" style="s2">whatever the choices that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.560" end="00:52:04.890" style="s2">with exactly like a computer program and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.060" end="00:52:06.870" style="s2">so in ideology is how to run like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.890" end="00:52:08.340" style="s2">computer program and it may be a very</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.870" end="00:52:09.990" style="s2">sophisticated ideology that has all</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.340" end="00:52:11.310" style="s2">kinds of if-then statements and branches</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.990" end="00:52:13.950" style="s2">so has a lot of ability to process</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.310" end="00:52:16.230" style="s2">complex environments to some level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.950" end="00:52:18.150" style="s2">effectiveness but nonetheless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.230" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">thinking like a computer which is quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.150" end="00:52:23.450" style="s2">distinct from thinking like a human</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:26.790" style="s2">for example creatively intuitively and</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.450" end="00:52:30.120" style="s2">so the blue church construct as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.790" end="00:52:32.220" style="s2">construct tends to prefer and generate</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.120" end="00:52:33.510" style="s2">this style of thinking and you just</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.220" end="00:52:35.670" style="s2">think again about how it shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.510" end="00:52:37.080" style="s2">school who raises their hand first who</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.670" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">has the right answer quickly who&#39;s able</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.080" end="00:52:40.560" style="s2">to respond very perfectly exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:43.350" style="s2">the teacher said if you&#39;re the student</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.560" end="00:52:44.760" style="s2">who maybe has a different idea about how</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.350" end="00:52:46.410" style="s2">this should be done you&#39;re maybe why</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.760" end="00:52:48.570" style="s2">asking a lot of questions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.410" end="00:52:50.610" style="s2">probably not familiar with having a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.570" end="00:52:52.110" style="s2">of success in school it&#39;s quite likely</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.610" end="00:52:53.640" style="s2">that you experience yourself as somehow</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.110" end="00:52:55.950" style="s2">losing in some way that was mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.640" end="00:52:58.410" style="s2">and that&#39;s the point right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.950" end="00:53:00.060" style="s2">necessarily the intent it&#39;s the nature</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.410" end="00:53:01.260" style="s2">of how this thing reinforces it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.060" end="00:53:02.730" style="s2">like an evolutionary nature just</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.260" end="00:53:07.380" style="s2">reinforces a certain set of behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.730" end="00:53:08.340" style="s2">and strategies and this shows up all</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.380" end="00:53:10.440" style="s2">over the place so think about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.340" end="00:53:13.620" style="s2">glibness of how things show up in news</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.440" end="00:53:15.090" style="s2">or in politics right if news in politics</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.620" end="00:53:18.000" style="s2">it&#39;s all about being able to it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.090" end="00:53:20.430" style="s2">like stand-up comedy but the job is to</p>

<p begin="00:53:24.030" end="00:53:27.720" style="s2">delivers the emotional payload that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.710" end="00:53:29.340" style="s2">already sort of been pre-arranged in the</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.380" end="00:53:33.990" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and that computer game just</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.910" end="00:53:35.430" style="s2">like any other computer game has a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.990" end="00:53:39.930" style="s2">series of states and it has a series of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.430" end="00:53:41.910" style="s2">moves and remember that old game I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.930" end="00:53:43.980" style="s2">was called King&#39;s Quest or Dragon Quest</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.910" end="00:53:45.540" style="s2">where it was a super stupid is like it</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.980" end="00:53:47.430" style="s2">was a cinema cinematic would play and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.540" end="00:53:49.290" style="s2">you just had four moves up-down</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.430" end="00:53:51.060" style="s2">left-right and your only job was to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.290" end="00:53:52.650" style="s2">watch the cinematic and go you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.060" end="00:53:54.890" style="s2">right direction it&#39;s like that level is</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.650" end="00:53:54.890" style="s2">stupid</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.559" end="00:53:59.049" style="s2">so then what happens this is the run</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.849" end="00:54:01.449" style="s2">into two distinct dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.049" end="00:54:03.130" style="s2">simultaneously one is when you move into</p>

<p begin="00:54:03.130" end="00:54:08.649" style="s2">decentralized medium it requires a</p>

<p begin="00:58:45.090" end="00:58:48.599" style="s2">and so what ends up happening is that as</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.800" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">a new kind of intelligence emerges that</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.599" end="00:58:54.030" style="s2">has the ability to see that this isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:59:23.369" end="00:59:26.820" style="s2">effectively critique the structures of</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.080" end="00:59:29.099" style="s2">the blue church sends out but it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.820" end="00:59:31.800" style="s2">yet actually create really high quality</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.099" end="00:59:32.700" style="s2">sense and we should be clear I said</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.800" end="00:59:34.980" style="s2">member I mentioned earlier this is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.700" end="00:59:36.210" style="s2">psychological thing as well I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.980" end="00:59:37.530" style="s2">talking about we&#39;re going to be the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.210" end="00:59:39.690" style="s2">kinds of psychologists and either side</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.530" end="00:59:41.010" style="s2">of the Boers now like people who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.690" end="00:59:42.270" style="s2">bleached shirt psychologists or</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.010" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">something in a jumper over here and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.270" end="00:59:45.780" style="s2">things will just look kind of the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:49.470" style="s2">but better no no it&#39;s gonna be very</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.780" end="00:59:52.530" style="s2">different the way that ideas form and</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.470" end="00:59:54.330" style="s2">the nature of how concepts show up like</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.530" end="00:59:58.580" style="s2">the idea of transparent igniting mind if</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.330" end="01:00:01.020" style="s2">you remember that I do so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.580" end="01:00:03.330" style="s2">story of a guy named Thomas Kuhn who</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.020" end="01:00:04.770" style="s2">coined the term para structure of</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.330" end="01:00:05.849" style="s2">scientific revolutions so the way he</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.770" end="01:00:08.130" style="s2">talked about it was there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.849" end="01:00:10.109" style="s2">linearity of paradigms we have the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.130" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">Newtonian paradigm and it works into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.109" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">gist to the point where there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">of edge cases that it can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:15.690" style="s2">people like what&#39;s going on here and</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:17.010" style="s2">some people want to be conservative and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.690" end="01:00:19.020" style="s2">defend the paradigm and kind of ignore</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.010" end="01:00:20.190" style="s2">the anomalies and other people grasp the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.020" end="01:00:21.599" style="s2">anomalies and it meant a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.190" end="01:00:23.070" style="s2">crazy ideas and so a couple of crazy</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.599" end="01:00:25.140" style="s2">ideas turn out to be enough so crazy and</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.070" end="01:00:26.580" style="s2">then you get a collapse of the old</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.140" end="01:00:28.920" style="s2">paradigm and the transformation to a new</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.580" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">paradigm and you know that&#39;s a cool</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.920" end="01:00:32.550" style="s2">story we may be on that process and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:32.820" style="s2">maybe the blue church is a paradigm and</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.550" end="01:00:34.350" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.820" end="01:00:37.620" style="s2">new thing this decentralized meme is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.350" end="01:00:41.130" style="s2">new paradigm my proposition is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.620" end="01:00:42.660" style="s2">actually a meta phenomenon which is to</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.130" end="01:00:45.060" style="s2">say that it&#39;s meted two paradigms in</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.660" end="01:00:47.400" style="s2">general that the entire concept of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.060" end="01:00:49.260" style="s2">paradigm is a thing that emerges inside</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.400" end="01:00:51.590" style="s2">a structure like the blue church that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.260" end="01:00:54.060" style="s2">a there&#39;s a model of how you make sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.590" end="01:00:56.250" style="s2">where you have a schema right a paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.060" end="01:00:57.600" style="s2">is nothing but a schema of what are good</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.250" end="01:00:59.790" style="s2">epistemological rules what does truth</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.600" end="01:01:00.660" style="s2">look like and what are collectibles good</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.790" end="01:01:01.770" style="s2">look like what are the good and what are</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.660" end="01:01:03.060" style="s2">the true how we know when we see them</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.770" end="01:01:05.370" style="s2">and we can sort of bind them very</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.060" end="01:01:07.880" style="s2">cleanly in this new environment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.370" end="01:01:10.010" style="s2">going to be I propose now I&#39;m sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.880" end="01:01:11.910" style="s2">hypothetical and I&#39;m making predictions</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.010" end="01:01:13.740" style="s2">running a different kind of mind a</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.910" end="01:01:15.990" style="s2">transparent American mind one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.740" end="01:01:18.390" style="s2">able to instantiate a microt paradigm</p>

<p begin="01:01:18.390" end="01:01:22.680" style="s2">is adapted to the local environment but</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.370" end="01:01:24.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t identified with that paradigm and</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.680" end="01:01:26.820" style="s2">so that it can jump out of that paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.630" end="01:01:28.440" style="s2">allow this to dissolve and instantiate a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.820" end="01:01:30.450" style="s2">new one or possibly even run two or</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.440" end="01:01:33.000" style="s2">three differentially just like Modern</p>

<p begin="01:01:33.000" end="01:01:37.410" style="s2">longer have to have sort of a particular</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.220" end="01:01:39.120" style="s2">investment strategy I can abstract that</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.410" end="01:01:40.470" style="s2">to a portfolio strategies and I can keep</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.120" end="01:01:42.840" style="s2">abstracting up to a portfolio of</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.470" end="01:01:44.910" style="s2">portfolios of portfolios at a certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.840" end="01:01:47.240" style="s2">point I get to a trans portfolio concept</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.910" end="01:01:49.860" style="s2">which operates it a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.240" end="01:01:51.260" style="s2">information dynamic so the phenomena of</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.860" end="01:01:55.560" style="s2">the intellectual dart web for example</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.260" end="01:01:57.630" style="s2">seems to have arisen in in opposition to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.560" end="01:02:01.440" style="s2">this idea of the blue church this idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.630" end="01:02:03.600" style="s2">of what we have is an ideology and a an</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.440" end="01:02:06.300" style="s2">ideology in the media and an ideology in</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.600" end="01:02:08.430" style="s2">in culture that maybe wasn&#39;t truly</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.300" end="01:02:09.960" style="s2">visible but the eruption of sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.430" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">intellectual dark web has shown that oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.960" end="01:02:13.770" style="s2">there is an ideology and this is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:17.280" style="s2">a movement that is that is showing up</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.770" end="01:02:20.730" style="s2">the floors and that ideology and that in</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.280" end="01:02:22.050" style="s2">some sense there&#39;s a religion and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.730" end="01:02:25.260" style="s2">described it in our interview really</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.050" end="01:02:28.110" style="s2">well it&#39;s like what the blue church has</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.260" end="01:02:30.300" style="s2">done has taken the idea the values of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.110" end="01:02:32.460" style="s2">openness and replace them with the with</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.300" end="01:02:34.080" style="s2">an ideology around openness so you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.460" end="01:02:35.340" style="s2">a certain set of things related to</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.080" end="01:02:38.040" style="s2">openness that you have to believe to</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.340" end="01:02:39.900" style="s2">actually be within the confines of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.040" end="01:02:42.570" style="s2">blue church right so it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.900" end="01:02:46.380" style="s2">religious mindset some ways well I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.570" end="01:02:50.390" style="s2">now we&#39;re gonna have to be very careful</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.380" end="01:02:52.710" style="s2">because the term religion is not clear</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.390" end="01:02:54.420" style="s2">what I&#39;ve noticed I actually wrote about</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.710" end="01:02:56.130" style="s2">this recently and I&#39;ve noticed in that</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.420" end="01:02:57.750" style="s2">dialogue and discovering what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.130" end="01:02:59.490" style="s2">by I wrote it for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.750" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">finding out okay what people respond to</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.490" end="01:03:04.320" style="s2">this is that the term religion seems to</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:05.820" style="s2">have actually been complexified for good</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.320" end="01:03:07.680" style="s2">reason it&#39;s actually by the way to</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.820" end="01:03:13.590" style="s2">include a number of other kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.680" end="01:03:16.170" style="s2">things that it is not at least three one</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.590" end="01:03:17.880" style="s2">is mysticism mysticism a religion are</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.170" end="01:03:20.610" style="s2">not the same if your religion is</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.880" end="01:03:22.230" style="s2">mystical then it&#39;s doing the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.610" end="01:03:23.540" style="s2">by the way if you&#39;re mysticism is</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.230" end="01:03:26.460" style="s2">religious it&#39;s doing the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.540" end="01:03:29.310" style="s2">another spirituality religion and</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.460" end="01:03:31.920" style="s2">spirituality are also not the same and</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.310" end="01:03:33.750" style="s2">then there&#39;s science and then when we</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.920" end="01:03:35.690" style="s2">might say quite obviously religion is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.750" end="01:03:37.800" style="s2">not science but the point is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.690" end="01:03:42.600" style="s2">sometimes these two lines are crossed</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.800" end="01:03:44.910" style="s2">and vice-versa so my proposition is just</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.600" end="01:03:46.230" style="s2">to define these domains and my</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.910" end="01:03:48.630" style="s2">proposition is one is that these domains</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.230" end="01:03:50.940" style="s2">are all real they&#39;re all by the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.630" end="01:03:53.940" style="s2">necessary to any well-functioning human</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.940" end="01:03:56.670" style="s2">civilization and that problematics arise</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.940" end="01:03:58.940" style="s2">when we cross domains when we have one</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.670" end="01:04:02.040" style="s2">of them trying to do the other ones job</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.940" end="01:04:04.430" style="s2">or we have institutional structures that</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.040" end="01:04:07.830" style="s2">cross domains and in depth mixing them</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.430" end="01:04:10.130" style="s2">so for example a lot of the problem that</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.830" end="01:04:12.750" style="s2">arose in the West was that the church</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.130" end="01:04:15.170" style="s2">the Catholic Church broadly was doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.750" end="01:04:17.940" style="s2">both was doing religion spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.170" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">mysticism and science all in a single</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.940" end="01:04:23.340" style="s2">institutional container and ended up</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:25.560" style="s2">crossing a lot of those domains so let</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.340" end="01:04:28.860" style="s2">me try to find them this is worthwhile</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.560" end="01:04:33.690" style="s2">so in the context of science what we</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.860" end="01:04:37.020" style="s2">mean is the loop process where we have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.690" end="01:04:39.630" style="s2">model of reality we then compare that to</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.020" end="01:04:43.140" style="s2">experiments of reality for the purposes</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.630" end="01:04:44.610" style="s2">of updating that model done that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.140" end="01:04:47.520" style="s2">that&#39;s science science is the process of</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.610" end="01:04:48.840" style="s2">having a model and using experiments to</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.520" end="01:04:50.580" style="s2">verify that model is a good fit to</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.840" end="01:04:51.990" style="s2">reality it exists for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.580" end="01:04:55.830" style="s2">having good models with which to operate</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.990" end="01:04:57.510" style="s2">in reality by the way technology is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.830" end="01:04:59.130" style="s2">inverse of that technology is the use of</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.510" end="01:04:59.800" style="s2">good models of reality to generate</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.130" end="01:05:01.210" style="s2">actions that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.800" end="01:05:03.340" style="s2">effective in reality right so if I have</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.210" end="01:05:05.110" style="s2">a model of if science gives me a model</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.340" end="01:05:06.880" style="s2">of ballistics I can then apply that</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.110" end="01:05:08.650" style="s2">model of ballistics to build ballistic</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.880" end="01:05:14.020" style="s2">missiles so those two things fit</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.650" end="01:05:15.880" style="s2">together quite nicely spirituality is</p>

<p begin="01:06:00.900" end="01:06:07.870" style="s2">religion then is kind of the community</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.900" end="01:06:10.060" style="s2">correlate it&#39;s how does self enter into</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.870" end="01:06:12.310" style="s2">relationship with other selves to form</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.060" end="01:06:14.590" style="s2">communities and then how do communities</p>

<p begin="01:06:16.420" end="01:06:23.410" style="s2">in world right so it&#39;s the embodied</p>

<p begin="01:06:23.410" end="01:06:28.150" style="s2">communities right that is religion as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.780" end="01:06:30.280" style="s2">function now notice what happens that</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.150" end="01:06:31.570" style="s2">when we will run into problems so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.280" end="01:06:33.070" style="s2">imagine that we have these embodied</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.570" end="01:06:35.890" style="s2">practices which are embodied practices</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.070" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not stories we tell the stories</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.890" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">to be able to help us understand and to</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:44.020" style="s2">convey and to reinforce the embodied</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:45.670" style="s2">practices but if we think the stories</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.020" end="01:06:48.790" style="s2">are where the truth lives and not the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.670" end="01:06:50.260" style="s2">practices we&#39;ve now crossed the domains</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.790" end="01:06:52.380" style="s2">we&#39;re now being to treat religion like</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.260" end="01:06:54.910" style="s2">science because the stories are a model</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.380" end="01:06:56.530" style="s2">if you are not living your religion if</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.910" end="01:06:58.660" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually embodied in your life</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.530" end="01:06:59.650" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it a great disservice and</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.660" end="01:07:01.570" style="s2">your self great to serve is in your</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.650" end="01:07:02.890" style="s2">community great to service and then of</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.570" end="01:07:04.330" style="s2">course you can even worse because with</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.890" end="01:07:07.570" style="s2">then what can happen is you can then try</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.330" end="01:07:09.840" style="s2">to actually do science from religion you</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.570" end="01:07:12.460" style="s2">can try to actually tell stories about</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.840" end="01:07:13.119" style="s2">reality about the world and then of</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.460" end="01:07:14.200" style="s2">course what you do</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.119" end="01:07:16.599" style="s2">because if your experiments with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.200" end="01:07:17.980" style="s2">world don&#39;t inform those stories do you</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.599" end="01:07:20.049" style="s2">then use it to change your body</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.980" end="01:07:21.249" style="s2">practices that seems like it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.049" end="01:07:22.480" style="s2">be very effective because your body</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.249" end="01:07:24.900" style="s2">practices have nothing to do with that</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.480" end="01:07:27.220" style="s2">across the one in the wrong direction so</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.900" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to do is demystify this</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.220" end="01:07:31.390" style="s2">damn thing that there&#39;s a thing religion</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:33.549" style="s2">that has an incredibly important purpose</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.390" end="01:07:34.599" style="s2">that sometimes we might oddly enough</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.549" end="01:07:37.029" style="s2">some people have thought well why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.599" end="01:07:38.829" style="s2">you call it ideology at which point I</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.029" end="01:07:40.569" style="s2">refer back to the definition of ideology</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.829" end="01:07:42.789" style="s2">ideology is what happens when science</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.569" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">tries to do religion it creates a model</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.789" end="01:07:45.519" style="s2">of how people ought to live in community</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:47.440" style="s2">then tries to impose that model on how</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.519" end="01:07:49.180" style="s2">people operate many a third way to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.440" end="01:07:50.470" style="s2">things there&#39;s very good reasons why</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.180" end="01:07:51.849" style="s2">that can never work it has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.470" end="01:07:54.730" style="s2">the relationship between the complex and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.849" end="01:07:55.539" style="s2">the complicated or why don&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.730" end="01:07:56.829" style="s2">call it culture</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.539" end="01:07:58.749" style="s2">aren&#39;t you just describing culture isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.829" end="01:08:01.809" style="s2">that culture and of course the</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.749" end="01:08:04.720" style="s2">difference is that culture is what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.809" end="01:08:06.970" style="s2">are doing religion is the doing nough</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.720" end="01:08:09.730" style="s2">sin a way so as to achieve a particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.970" end="01:08:11.769" style="s2">consequence so religion is the process</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.730" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">by which we develop a thriving and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.769" end="01:08:15.190" style="s2">enduring culture well that&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.079" end="01:08:16.630" style="s2">the same thing as culture we might have</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.190" end="01:08:18.250" style="s2">a shitty culture and that&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.630" end="01:08:20.380" style="s2">thing and religion is a vector it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.250" end="01:08:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s an orientation to movement just</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.380" end="01:08:24.520" style="s2">like spirituality is not the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.000" end="01:08:26.049" style="s2">as just being a person spirituality is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.520" end="01:08:28.690" style="s2">process whereby you would try to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.049" end="01:08:31.029" style="s2">an integration of self with self and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.690" end="01:08:33.819" style="s2">relationship of self with world okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.029" end="01:08:35.799" style="s2">then you have mysticism all right now</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.819" end="01:08:37.359" style="s2">religion quite often crosses the streams</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.799" end="01:08:39.069" style="s2">with mysticism which is very problematic</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.359" end="01:08:42.670" style="s2">because obviously what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.069" end="01:08:44.259" style="s2">is they&#39;re trying to create either that</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.670" end="01:08:47.469" style="s2">becomes a variation of mystifying</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.259" end="01:08:48.850" style="s2">science or becomes an ocean well when we</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.469" end="01:08:51.909" style="s2">just talk about mysticism is it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.850" end="01:08:54.190" style="s2">religion overcoating mysticism and</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.909" end="01:08:55.569" style="s2">mysticism is the hardest I haven&#39;t got a</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.190" end="01:08:59.679" style="s2">lot of clarity on this Jeff but let me</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.569" end="01:09:01.900" style="s2">try it it has to do with the pure</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.679" end="01:09:03.730" style="s2">relation of self itself how do we</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.900" end="01:09:05.560" style="s2">actually become clear in self so as</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.730" end="01:09:07.150" style="s2">opposed to head we become integrated</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.560" end="01:09:09.759" style="s2">self in relationship with world with</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.150" end="01:09:11.830" style="s2">your spirituality mysticism is like I</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.759" end="01:09:14.529" style="s2">think shows that mostly in practices</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.830" end="01:09:16.540" style="s2">like meditation where you&#39;re not trying</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.529" end="01:09:18.639" style="s2">to relate self to world at all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.540" end="01:09:21.819" style="s2">just trying to get complete clarity on</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.639" end="01:09:23.380" style="s2">the nature of self on for example here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.819" end="01:09:25.530" style="s2">a concrete version of mysticism oddly</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.380" end="01:09:27.180" style="s2">enough what are your values</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.530" end="01:09:28.680" style="s2">where do your values what are your the</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.180" end="01:09:32.700" style="s2">actual basis of your vows that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.680" end="01:09:34.290" style="s2">doing deep into you not necessarily no</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.700" end="01:09:37.050" style="s2">not at all what are your values in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.290" end="01:09:38.520" style="s2">context of living but what are the</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.050" end="01:09:40.680" style="s2">values that are actually at the depth of</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.520" end="01:09:42.090" style="s2">you that give rise to you and their</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.680" end="01:09:43.910" style="s2">their orientation relationship that</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.090" end="01:09:47.460" style="s2">would be like a properly mystical</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.910" end="01:09:49.980" style="s2">relationship and it&#39;s mysterious because</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.460" end="01:09:51.930" style="s2">it has it is deep the only way you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.980" end="01:09:53.910" style="s2">get access to it is to actually get</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.930" end="01:09:56.550" style="s2">really good at listening to things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.910" end="01:09:57.810" style="s2">don&#39;t have structure because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.550" end="01:10:00.210" style="s2">coming from the outside world at all</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.810" end="01:10:01.380" style="s2">they&#39;re entirely internal and now would</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.210" end="01:10:02.940" style="s2">of course what happens is these things</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.380" end="01:10:04.590" style="s2">relate to each other to the degree to</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.940" end="01:10:06.510" style="s2">which I&#39;m able to achieve clarity of</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.590" end="01:10:08.130" style="s2">relationship to self I&#39;m able to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.510" end="01:10:09.870" style="s2">clarity to the nature of how that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.130" end="01:10:12.270" style="s2">works well then I can use that in my</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.870" end="01:10:14.550" style="s2">spirituality and so mysticism meditation</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.270" end="01:10:16.290" style="s2">is a good practice to have as a basis of</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.550" end="01:10:17.430" style="s2">a spiritual practice through it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.290" end="01:10:19.320" style="s2">distinct right they&#39;re not the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.430" end="01:10:21.240" style="s2">thing a spiritual practice may rely on</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.320" end="01:10:22.670" style="s2">clarity of self to achieve integration</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.240" end="01:10:25.830" style="s2">of self relationship with world</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.670" end="01:10:28.050" style="s2">and similarly religion is a good basis</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.830" end="01:10:29.310" style="s2">to do science right you can&#39;t do science</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.050" end="01:10:30.990" style="s2">very well to say if you&#39;re in a culture</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.310" end="01:10:32.850" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t tell the truth if everybody</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.990" end="01:10:35.220" style="s2">is a liar science is very very</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.850" end="01:10:37.350" style="s2">dysfunctional or religion is about how</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.220" end="01:10:39.330" style="s2">do you actually build people who tell</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.350" end="01:10:42.120" style="s2">the truth how do you actually create the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.330" end="01:10:44.430" style="s2">embodied practices like child rearing is</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.120" end="01:10:46.380" style="s2">a religious function how do you actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.430" end="01:10:47.970" style="s2">raise good people what are the practices</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.380" end="01:10:50.070" style="s2">and traditions and rituals that give</p>

<p begin="01:22:10.170" end="01:22:14.310" style="s2">I mentioned that these have been always</p>

<p begin="01:27:21.400" end="01:27:24.610" style="s2">figure out how to do that sleight of</p>

<p begin="01:27:24.610" end="01:27:32.710" style="s2">how to allow the space for this game B</p>

<p begin="01:27:35.470" end="01:27:40.690" style="s2">have a way to generate almost like</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.330" end="01:27:45.520" style="s2">parenting parenting is a great example i</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.690" end="01:27:48.490" style="s2">do not design my child but parents are</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.520" end="01:27:49.750" style="s2">necessary if you want to have a child in</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.490" end="01:27:51.870" style="s2">the relationship with parents our child</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.750" end="01:27:55.450" style="s2">seems to have three specific</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.870" end="01:27:58.360" style="s2">requirements or rules the first is</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.450" end="01:28:03.070" style="s2">obviously the creation of the fertilized</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.360" end="01:28:05.700" style="s2">egg which becomes the zygote the second</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.070" end="01:28:09.160" style="s2">is the bloom the creation of a space</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.700" end="01:28:10.900" style="s2">that allows the zygote to develop by and</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.160" end="01:28:11.440" style="s2">for itself on its own basis in on its</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.900" end="01:28:15.010" style="s2">own terms</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.440" end="01:28:16.750" style="s2">right not outside in the world I mean if</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.010" end="01:28:18.700" style="s2">I were to put the zygote of game be in</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.750" end="01:28:21.130" style="s2">the middle of game a drop it on to the</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.700" end="01:28:24.340" style="s2">streets of the financial district it</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.130" end="01:28:26.140" style="s2">would not survive very long it&#39;s not yet</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.340" end="01:28:27.760" style="s2">strong enough to survive on its own in</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.140" end="01:28:29.580" style="s2">the world but if we can create the</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.760" end="01:28:31.900" style="s2">zygote and then embed it in the womb</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.580" end="01:28:33.850" style="s2">then there&#39;s the last piece of parenting</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.900" end="01:28:36.100" style="s2">which is that when we think about</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.850" end="01:28:37.240" style="s2">ordinary design like say an architect</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.100" end="01:28:40.240" style="s2">designing a house or an engineer</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.240" end="01:28:42.580" style="s2">designing a vehicle all of the agency is</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.240" end="01:28:44.860" style="s2">in the part of the designer when we</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.580" end="01:28:47.350" style="s2">think about parenting the agency of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.860" end="01:28:50.050" style="s2">parents is always fully in service of</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.350" end="01:28:53.650" style="s2">the agency of the child and the agency</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.050" end="01:28:56.320" style="s2">of the child is primary so we can</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.650" end="01:28:58.690" style="s2">generate the zygote we can create the</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.320" end="01:29:01.390" style="s2">womb and then we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.690" end="01:29:04.390" style="s2">always be mindful to put our agency in</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.390" end="01:29:07.860" style="s2">the service of this world that is in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.390" end="01:29:07.860" style="s2">process of giving birth to itself</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.340" end="01:29:16.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s all that we can say in this</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.280" end="01:29:21.940" style="s2">analogy what&#39;s the womb this is going to</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.390" end="01:29:29.350" style="s2">be spaces that are created and enabled</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.940" end="01:29:33.610" style="s2">to be available to the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.350" end="01:29:36.340" style="s2">experimenting with game B so literally</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.610" end="01:29:38.770" style="s2">physically spaces incubators as it were</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.340" end="01:29:41.140" style="s2">or entirely new towns or cities</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.770" end="01:29:42.970" style="s2">I actually know that for example a</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.140" end="01:29:44.350" style="s2">number of countries are in the process</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.970" end="01:29:45.940" style="s2">of endeavoring to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.350" end="01:29:49.330" style="s2">build quote-unquote smart cities of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.940" end="01:29:52.450" style="s2">future so the idea in the Chinese of</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.330" end="01:29:55.660" style="s2">course had built innumerable mega cities</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.450" end="01:29:56.890" style="s2">over the past several decades well</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.660" end="01:29:59.170" style="s2">things like that we&#39;re going didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.890" end="01:30:00.580" style="s2">happen you know two or more are going to</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.170" end="01:30:03.220" style="s2">have to gather and it&#39;s going to have to</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.580" end="01:30:04.690" style="s2">be a lot more than two and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.220" end="01:30:06.610" style="s2">to need to learn how to gather first in</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.690" end="01:30:08.500" style="s2">small groups just in houses and homes</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.610" end="01:30:10.840" style="s2">and to create this territory in this</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.500" end="01:30:14.680" style="s2">space where they can gather and practice</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.840" end="01:30:17.680" style="s2">game B and create they think you said</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.680" end="01:30:19.270" style="s2">the field but create a space where these</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.680" end="01:30:23.110" style="s2">practices are honored and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.270" end="01:30:25.150" style="s2">explored and then those groups are going</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.110" end="01:30:29.980" style="s2">to need to come into relationship in</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.150" end="01:30:32.190" style="s2">larger spaces and perhaps this is where</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.980" end="01:30:34.840" style="s2">we just start thinking about things like</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.190" end="01:30:37.330" style="s2">resources I mean one of the primary</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.840" end="01:30:39.730" style="s2">aspects of game a is the necessity to</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.330" end="01:30:42.820" style="s2">continue to work in things that are not</p>
