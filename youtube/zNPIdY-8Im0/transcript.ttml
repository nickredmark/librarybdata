<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">tradition and that is uh i don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">and she requested that if i killed a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">buck could i save the bladder for her</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">apparently stagg&#39;s bladders uh were part</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">finned horn style agriculture at least</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">so that was my one relationship to kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">of the finn horned thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">that sounds like biodynamic agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">actually which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:29.599" style="s2">used in finton quite a lot um but they</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">do things like mixing those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">things up</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">in in a bull&#39;s horn and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.480" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">stir it</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">umpteen times clockwise and umpteen</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">times anti-clockwise</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">in the full moon and you bury those</p>

<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:44.879" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">and well certainly won&#39;t put our</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.879" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">analytical scientists to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">prove that one right but their produce</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">is wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">and they swear by it and it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">working yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">of course i was highly skeptical being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">rational scientific sort but heck if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">know she won the stag bladder i gave her</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">a stag bladder and she had one of the</p>

<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">just made it all much more real to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">importance of the work that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">work i&#39;m doing work lots of people we</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">know are doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">to try to save the world god damn it</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">we got to do it yeah saving ourselves is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">probably more what we&#39;re doing because</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">the process is going to keep going um</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">even without us but it would be a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">impoverished planet even if only our</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">species would power out</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">center stage left but in the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">we&#39;re probably going to take a hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:07.760" style="s2">lot of other species with us so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s do the good work</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.760" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">yeah exactly and uh yeah in fact i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">you said we are a capstone species</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">capable of creating conditions</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">conducive to all life we can design for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">ecosystems and planetary health nurture</p>

<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.639" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">vitality which really resonated with me</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">because recently i&#39;ve discovered a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">thinker</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">named tyson juncka porta he has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">amazing book out called sand talk i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">had him on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:44.639" style="s2">podcast three times and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">humans as the custodial species and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.639" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">that concept and your concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">capstone species are very very similar</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">and that yes you&#39;re absolutely right a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">without humans is quite different and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">maybe in a huge</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">fundamental way than a universe with</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">humans and we&#39;ll talk about that in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">detail when we get later in the talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">yeah i just want to say briefly about</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">tyson young like he&#39;s been on my radar</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:11.919" style="s2">for for a while and i still haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">his</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">and i really want to read his book and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">learn more about him because</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">ancestral wisdom carriers and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">the resonance is striking and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">if you i should send you the link to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">conversation i have with a guy called</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">johnny freeland</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">from new zealand who&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">regenerative development network</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">in in auckland and um the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">is about</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">square and circular systems thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">i think you&#39;d enjoy having him on your</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:53.759" style="s2">show at some point as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">yeah that&#39;d be great really good you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.759" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">know and tyson</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">it you know provides a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">we talk about this in the first episode</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">double perspective uh one is his</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">australian tribal indigenous people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">perspective and then he&#39;s also been a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">student of complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">and the way he blends those two without</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">offending either is quite remarkable i</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:17.039" style="s2">this book is a major work of art as well</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.039" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not linear it weaves it brings in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">curious things but you know read that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">damn book it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">now before we dig into new material i do</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">think it&#39;s helpful to recap</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">three of the big ideas that we talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">about last time so people</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">can have some grounding without having</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">to go back and read the previous episode</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">so first daniel if you would if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">could talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">and the overlap of course and one</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">probably includes the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">uh the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">regenerative perspective versus a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">sustainable perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">well you&#39;ll get different answers from</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">different people when you when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">that question but</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">in my perspective i see it as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">that goes from business as usual to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">doing things a little bit better which</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">is green</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">um to getting to that point where</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">sustainable is defined of having</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">no negative impact um of whatever you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">you don&#39;t add to the problem but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">the problem is that we&#39;ve been adding to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">the problem for hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">with increasing impact and now what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">need to do is to actually go beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">restore the damage we&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">working regeneratively</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">goes beyond all of that in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">we really begin to re-identify with life</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">as a planetary evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">us ourselves as participants in nested</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">and we we ask ourselves the question how</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:49.840" style="s2">do we participate</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">appropriately in that nested complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.840" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">to increase its health wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">vitality and capability to keep</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">evolving into an uncertain and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:08:02.280" style="s2">uncontrollable future and so working</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">regeneratively is always working</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.280" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">developmentally and in with an</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">evolutionary mindset so you you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">it&#39;s more important to build the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">capacity of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">to keep on evolving and keep on</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">responding to change and adapting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">transforming</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">then to lock down on a specific solution</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">and then pretend that once we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">right blueprint in place</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">everything will be happy ever after that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">good sense uh another important idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">that&#39;s in your book and again i would</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">highly recommend people read</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">daniel&#39;s book designing regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">cultures is the concept of three</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">horizons which you credit to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">bill sharp i think and a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">others could you tell us about the three</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">horizons and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">you know what they are and where you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">think we are on that transition</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">well first maybe to highlight because</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">sometimes people fall into that trap</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">um mckinsey brought out a very basic</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">three horizons</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">model in the late 90s and so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">confuse it with that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">three horizon model it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">different one</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">and it was developed within the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">international futures forum</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">the book three horizons a patterning of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">hope was written by</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">my friend bill sharp and he&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">one who&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">dedicated the last 10 years to really</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">get this practice more widely recognized</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">than out there because</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">after many decades in um technology</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">futures and foresight work</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">bill realized that we needed a more</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">agile</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">and open framework to converse about</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">possible futures um and that even the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">kind of classic scenario planning for</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">scenario framework was limited and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">not not agile enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">and in a nutshell three horizons allows</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">us to do is to have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">to some extent to frame it</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:50.880" style="s2">regeneratively it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">working with the opposing forces of on</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.880" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">the one hand the perspective that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">needing to keep business as usual</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">running so the the the manager or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">um politician in charge having to keep</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">the lights on people in schools people</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">and jobs all of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">and that&#39;s called horizon one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">business as usual</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">and then in on the opposing end you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">horizon three</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">the new viable future that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">right now is only existing in in pockets</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">and is often seen as the visionary</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">transformative aspect where</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">that horizon one can&#39;t fully connect</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">with and normally you get the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">head butting between the visionaries and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">and the managers</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">and by introducing horizon two which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">um disruptive innovation innovation</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">entrepreneurship as a bridge that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">can help us to really have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:46.720" style="s2">conversation of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">do we still need to keep from</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">business as usual from horizon one what</p>

<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">as the potential bridge building towards</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">space you can then ask</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.959" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">what innovation is a horizon two minus</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">meaning um something that will just</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">prolong business as usual and will be</p>

<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">and what is the horizon two plus a a</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:37.279" style="s2">that&#39;s it in a nutshell but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">one sentence i really like by bill sharp</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.279" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">that he often uses when he facilitates</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">everybody agree on what to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">um immediately after you facilitate a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">conversation with this framework</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">but what you do create is an environment</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">disagree much more intelligently and has</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">developed future consciousness in a</p>

<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">the sequence of what to do when in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">a completely new way and i&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">work in in many contexts and i&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.399" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s a very useful tool yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">like it a lot and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">up a cliff right if someone comes to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">with a business idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">goes a to b straight up a cliff the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">probability of that succeeding is off</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:32.320" style="s2">almost zero one has to think about how</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">do you find a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.320" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">a slope to climb up the hill rather than</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">to jump up a thousand foot cliff</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">and you know this this kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">strikes me as very congruent with that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">it&#39;s also congruent with our game b</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:47.200" style="s2">theories we talk about game a which we</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">can call a world in crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">and true game b a viable meta-stable</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">and then we talk about transition be</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">which is the uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">the world between the two so i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">we&#39;re all pretty much on the same page</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s really being used in</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">a lot of powerfully transformative</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">contexts so so bill&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">kind of got in with an organization</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">called leaders quest</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">a number of years ago because because</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">realize the the usefulness of this tool</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">we&#39;re asking him to train up their</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">facilitators when they take out</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.639" style="s2">c-level business leaders to to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">extreme environments like</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.639" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">talking to people on death row or</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">spending a couple of days in a slum in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">mumbai and then they they kind of post</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">and and create transformative insights</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">for people and over time</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">that partnership has grown into work</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">with an organization called futures</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">stewards that is now collaborating with</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">with with urban environments it it makes</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">sense to go through a</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">the nutrient loop but it makes absolute</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:40.880" style="s2">sense to do so but one one example that</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.240" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">wales who&#39;ve been working on these</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">more than that actually 50 years now</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">were instrumental in setting up in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">in their local farm and then they get a</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">depending on on the harvest at the time</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">so you you kind of share in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">rather than just a veg box scheme where</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">you can stop it anytime</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">you actually share the risk over the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">whole year and you commit to your pharma</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">for the whole year and that way they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">calculate the risk of agriculture much</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">better and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">as part of this particular vegbox scheme</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">or csa scheme was that when</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">they brought the vegetables to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">doors they would take a big</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">food so they they were really literally</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">closing the loops in that practical way</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">with their committed community and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">that&#39;s possible but but it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">not a mainstream solution for</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">the streets of new york or wherever</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">but on the other hand a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">actually was the superintendent for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:58.640" style="s2">the waste treatment center at a city of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">about a hundred thousand people medium</p>

<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">and they ran a large scale experiment</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">using a process</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">to create a fertilizer called</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">malorganite which basically took</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">urban sludge got rid of the antibiotics</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">got rid of the heavy metals i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">remember the details of the process</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">and then they gave the malorganite away</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">free to everybody in the county who</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">wanted to come and get it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">and that was quite interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing here on mayoka like in</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">mallorca the sludge from the sewage</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:31.679" style="s2">treatment plants gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:34.960" style="s2">dried in kind of racks with concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.679" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">sunlight and then that really baked</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:40.400" style="s2">material gets um put into the compost</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">composting and then the compost is free</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">to people to to get and put back on</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">their fields</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">so ultimately we are cycling human waste</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">on majorca as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">yeah i just i always hit this again</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">because i think in terms of cycles right</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">as a systems thinker</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">and i go wait a minute if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">recycling this very concentrated source</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">of nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.799" style="s2">then there&#39;s no effing way we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">to be able to be long-term sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">especially not with a population of 10</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">billion people</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">particularly if we you know have</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">committed to not degrade mother nature</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">any further so</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">i just like to underscore this that i at</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">can&#39;t take organic farming seriously as</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">a solution to the world&#39;s problems until</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">agree to solve this problem which is to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">recycle these nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:23.919" style="s2">yeah we i think we&#39;re all somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">oblivious to the fact of how important</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">phosphorus is to the future of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:28.960" style="s2">civilization and and human life on earth</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:32.160" style="s2">and phosphorus is a tricky one and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">like even</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.160" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">like i was talking to the the local</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">traditional pharmacy on the island and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">asked them sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">do you remember what did your great</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">great grandfather import</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">and the one thing that they imported</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:47.679" style="s2">even back then was phosphorus</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">and and so yes absolutely true we need</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.679" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">make sure that we keep that on the land</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">yep you&#39;re exactly right phosphorus is</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">probably the limiting factor</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">of uh life on earth period right i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">i remember as a kid reading an article</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">by isaac asimov who calculated that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">all the phosphorus in the crust of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">earth was only enough to support about</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">six trillion people something like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">and in reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">the limits are way way lower than that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">in fact i&#39;ve seen some arguments that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">say we&#39;ve already exceeded the bounds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">phosphorus</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">extraction from the earth and unless we</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">get this recycling all the way around</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">of our wastes we may be in a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:27.600" style="s2">depletive role on at least the easily</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">accessible phosphorus right now</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">renewable space because otherwise we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">design a system that in 250 300 500</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.520" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">we have to redesign again might as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">get clear that there&#39;s there&#39;s a hint in</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">the word non-renewable resource</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">it will eventually run out indeed and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:04.640" style="s2">that is the transition that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:07.039" style="s2">to make right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.640" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">deeply and personally and</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">and so now let&#39;s let&#39;s move to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">personal side this is something we</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">as much in the first episode and this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.600" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">a fairly long quote from your book</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">alienation from nature&#39;s wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.760" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">beginning to give way to a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">that celebrates our communion with</p>

<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s been wordy isn&#39;t it yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">it&#39;s great i mean it says it all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">i normally don&#39;t take quotes that long</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">but i i looked at places to cut it</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t all there unless they gave</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s i think it&#39;s part of my german</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">heritage the germans love</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">making these really long sentences and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">then they put the verb at the end</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">so you really have to build your</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">capacity to sort of hold it in suspense</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">until you know what&#39;s what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:27.600" style="s2">but yeah what that paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">tries to describe in very western</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.600" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">long-winded ways is basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:33.520" style="s2">i i believe what um tyson jacob porter</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:35.679" style="s2">speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.520" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">so this is not some sort of oh now we</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.679" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">need to evolve to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">a completely well we need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">move forward rather than backward that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">for sure but but there has</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">that kind of wisdom has been around for</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">most of our species existence</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">in many different ways whether it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:53.600" style="s2">australia in south africa</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">south america or africa or many other</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.600" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s right and i i will</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:02.240" style="s2">confess personally to having become</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">more aware of the personal</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.240" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">operating system level changes that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">coming from a sort of scientific realist</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">materialist perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">you know i think i was a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:17.679" style="s2">blinkered on realizing how important</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">you know even if sticking with a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.679" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">materialist realist perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">that the operating system in the agents</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">matters a whole lot on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:27.039" style="s2">capable of being developed in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">culture right</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.039" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">and so you know part of this mission</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:32.960" style="s2">that we&#39;re all on to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:34.480" style="s2">you know create a what comes next which</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.960" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">is truly sustainable and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.480" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">frankly better for everybody you know i</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.360" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">become much</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">more interested and aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">importance</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">of what people call expanded</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:49.880" style="s2">or spirituality people who listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">show know that i don&#39;t like the word</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.880" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">uh call it the s word but i&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">understand that at least</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">some meanings of it uh are important and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">and that you know people do have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">reach</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">this new point where they understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">that we live in a constrained world and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">that there are other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">richness rather than accumulating</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">stuff and so we have to really uh think</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.799" style="s2">clearly about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">and and we have to co-evolve uh our</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">institutions and our systems on one side</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">but with the operating system of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">humans or what we might call</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">consciousness higher consciousness etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:31.679" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting because you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">can really reframe frame this whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.679" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:37.039" style="s2">scientific terms but not necessarily if</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">you follow the dogma that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.039" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">western science is the only science that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">then qualifies for that game because</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">really the vedanta and many other</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">sciences</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">of the past have a very different take</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">even if you think of it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">western science</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">the explanatory models that western</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">science had to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">really speak about complexity or even</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">what we were finding out in physics at</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">the beginning of the last century</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">and weren&#39;t enough so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">that all these geniuses of physics</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.919" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">around that time turned towards the east</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">and the vedanta and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">and vedic sciences in order to explain</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">what they were bumping up against and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">um like i just recently had a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">conversation with with elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">sartorius who was a evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">biologist and she she puts it in</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:28.559" style="s2">quite interesting terms of saying it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">keyboard</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.559" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">and you can either start with the low</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">notes which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">um stuff evolving out of mata and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">eventually there&#39;s life and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">emergence and oh there&#39;s consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">or you can start at the high notes of</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">the keyboard</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">where the the axiom of that science the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">fundamental pre</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">supposition that that science is based</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">on is that everything is conscious</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:51.919" style="s2">and everything is alive and and there</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">are lots of scientists who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.919" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">operating from that even</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:59.039" style="s2">islamic sciences when they were asked to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">write down their fundamental axioms</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.039" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">axiom number one was allah created the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">world the living world</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">and axiom number two was he told us to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">study it</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">so so what i&#39;m what i&#39;m getting at is</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">in terms of what we accept</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">as part of the scientific discussion</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:21.039" style="s2">suddenly we see that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">out of the acceptance of multiple ways</p>

<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">approaching that subject there&#39;s a huge</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">little bit here and you know people</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:30.799" style="s2">listen to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">the show know that this is something i</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.799" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">do a little bit on this particular topic</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">and that i find it uh worrisome if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:43.200" style="s2">vedantic science or islamic science</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">because they&#39;re not really science i</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.200" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">mean science is</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">a specific way of knowing that has</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">a engine inside of it where people</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">create hypotheses they do experiments</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">they look at data</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">and this is the key that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">collectively in an intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">and inter-objective way verify or</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.279" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">fundamentally different and i would</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">argue in most cases</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">better way of actually moving towards</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">similar to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">great literature they certainly have</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">some deep insights</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">that are worth thinking about and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">why it&#39;s so useful for</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">physicists trying to wrestle with what</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">the hell is quantum mechanics in 1922</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2">right that&#39;s such a weird concept</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s very useful for them to look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">some particularly the eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">because there&#39;s essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">equivalent of literature kind of deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">reaches to you know things beyond what</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">we can know in a solid fashion but they</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">actually science and so but this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">exactly the conversation where we</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">actually i mean yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of bs in that field</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">and a lot of bizarre kind of on the one</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">critiquing science and then using</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">science to build credibility in a in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:23.120" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">spiritual seeker field um i i dislike</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.120" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">that kind of energy</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">myself and ultimately science is an</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">activity that is based on agreement of a</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">methodology and certain axioms and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.559" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">from there we can build so basically if</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">we follow these axioms and we follow</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">this methodology then we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">observe something that is actually that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.360" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">create inter-subjective consensus about</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">and then if we repeat it we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">result to verify whether our consensus</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">makes sense and in that loose framing</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:30:00.799" style="s2">i think you you can say that there have</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.799" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">in many traditions rigorous study of how</p>

<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">works and also it&#39;s that the one</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">even within science there&#39;s a point</p>

<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">knowing collapse</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">down to just thinking and analytical</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">particularly the world as it can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">expressed in the kind of languages</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">that are used in western cultures</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">western languages which are very</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">different from the pictographic</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">and the kind of space of consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">um like a kanji alphabet or</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">a mandarin alphabet offer and and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">and goethe for example was was very</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">keenly aware that</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">we were going down in research science</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">200 years ago a tract that was not</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">paying attention to qualities and was</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">only paying attention to what is</p>

<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:01.039" style="s2">and analytically um or statistically</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.240" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">significant</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.039" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">like basically quantifiable in one way</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">turned into turnable into mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s a it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">wonderful powerful tool as we know</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the only way of creating</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">knowledge about the world i believe yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:22.799" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">and this is you know again you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.799" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">no newtonian and i agree with you and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">push back a lot against what i call</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">newtonian naivete</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">right and i was guilty of it as a nerdy</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">and i can predict all of history</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.519" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">uh and yet we&#39;ve come to know you know a</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">and i guess this is where i react</p>

<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">of science isn&#39;t enough because yes</p>

<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">of a 14 year old nerds perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">not enough but the world has moved on</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">since that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">time as you mentioned earlier early in</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">so when you allow science to grow to</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">bigger perspectives and science is an</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">i think it can it can absorb these</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">things that you know that are useful and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">reproducible as you say if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">reproducible</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">if you can state it as a hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">you can reproduce it objectively</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">then it&#39;s science no matter what the the</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">i i mean i&#39;m i&#39;m deeply influenced by</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">like my connection with professor brian</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">and all the wisdom that i learned from</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">significantly shaped my world view</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">goethe coming back together briefly said</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">supposedly the the history of science is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">science itself and</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">coined this term called the historicity</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:44.799" style="s2">of science</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">and part of the problem is that if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.799" end="00:33:49.039" style="s2">were really open and didn&#39;t have a dogma</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">of where to put the lens of science then</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.039" end="00:33:52.399" style="s2">we could study</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">like like like for example the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.399" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">battle that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">paul stamets has been fighting to just</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:33:59.440" style="s2">put more</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">effort into researching how the fungi</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.440" end="00:34:03.760" style="s2">kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">holds so many keys towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.760" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">earth custodianship or earth stewardship</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">or healing the land</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">um so we we very often they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">certain areas of science where we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">putting the emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">and the research in while the science</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">that is beholden to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.399" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">technological quick fix solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">just offer</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">solutions to problems we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">because we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">mistaken technologies is where most of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">the research goes</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">so my my question is is if we if we did</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">science more daringly in the areas where</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:40.079" style="s2">we needed</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">wonderful and i&#39;m absolutely not against</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">science at all i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">open to other ways of knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">holding</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">the perspectives that different lenses</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:52.560" style="s2">on the world give us</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">lightly enough that we can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.560" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">their point of intersection i agree that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:34:58.400" style="s2">they make a final distinction then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">move on the things you talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">not necessarily looking in the right</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">places our priorities aren&#39;t right in</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">science etc</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re you&#39;re referencing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">mycenium the uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:11.200" style="s2">amazing fungal networks which we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">learning rapidly are</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.200" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">amazingly interesting uh that unify</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">uh the the soil and our plant worlds in</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">ways we had no idea 15 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">but and this is the point about science</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">we are now investigating that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">and so i would make a distinction and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">this is something i&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">make clear to people in these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">discussions</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">is that yes the sociology of science</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">definitely needs a lot of tuning you</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">know how is funding done what is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:43.599" style="s2">career who is a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">what is the basis by which we do</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.599" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">inter-subjective verification</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">currently it&#39;s peer-reviewed journals is</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">that correct all those things need a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">of work</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">but the inner engine of science itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">whether you take a properion model</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">or other exact models of how we go from</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">hypothesis to a tentative</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">truth and always remember it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:04.480" style="s2">tentative truth if a scientist says if</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">someone says</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.480" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">science says this is true they&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">scientist right because</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:12.079" style="s2">science truths are always tentative you</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:14.400" style="s2">know make that distinction between that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.079" end="00:36:16.560" style="s2">sociology of science which frames what</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.400" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">questions who&#39;s a scientist etc</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.560" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">with the actual engine of how we do</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">science and i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">it makes a lot more sense uh that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">the engine</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">i can&#39;t find a problem with and but the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">sociology there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">a lot of ways to improve so you know i</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">just want to make that last one and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">going to push back on another one just</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">happens to be one of my pet peeves</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s something i studied</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">you talked about mandarin and pictograph</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">uh versus alphabetic</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s likely to be true</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">and here&#39;s why as we&#39;ve learned more</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">about the neurocognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">of literacy and i would point people to</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">if we really look at the evolution of</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">we can see how important collaboration</p>

<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">no fences and so on walking around the</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">i had a sense of ownership despite the</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">and the connection with the people was</p>

<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:48.400" style="s2">fairly recently and said ah well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">part of it rut but you&#39;re missing an</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">important part and i had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">good conversation with them and i</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">realized they were absolutely right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve reformulated it as</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">follows that yes we need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:03.440" style="s2">self-actualize so that we reach</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">who we can be to make ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.440" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">better people right and accomplish what</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">we can accomplish however</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">that has to be in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">community actualization</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">right because we are deeply social</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">animals as you&#39;ve pointed out many times</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">and as many other people have pointed</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:22.200" style="s2">now let&#39;s turn that around and say the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:25.359" style="s2">point of community</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.200" end="00:44:27.640" style="s2">actualization is to create a self-act to</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">increase our capability for</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.640" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">self-actualization</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">which increases our capability for</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">community actualization</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">as a virtuous circle this is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">as far as i understand it i&#39;m not in</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">this group but i i think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">the um change agents development group</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">that carol sanford is running with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:45.680" style="s2">of people who are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:48.480" style="s2">regenerative movement</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.680" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">is basically creating a forum in which</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.480" end="00:44:51.760" style="s2">people can engage</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">in providing for each other the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.760" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">community in which</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:57.040" style="s2">you keep checking that we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">in this journey</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.040" end="00:45:02.880" style="s2">of paying attention to our</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">reading of the world and how we process</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.880" end="00:45:05.920" style="s2">our reading of the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:08.319" style="s2">and how we develop ourselves and our</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.920" end="00:45:11.839" style="s2">capability to fully respond</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.319" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">to the situation in a way that we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.839" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">our essence our unique contribution to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">the situation</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it has this idea of nested</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:24.160" style="s2">of the only way that you can really</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">serve yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">is serving the the next larger hole that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">engaged with and that that sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">akin to what you were describing to my</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">mind yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">the only slight nuance is that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">community has to have as one of its main</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:42.560" style="s2">goals in its operating system helping</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">each individual self-actualize as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:48.119" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">activation and actualization produces</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.119" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">self-actualization which increases</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:54.480" style="s2">community actualization so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">virtual circle dynamic that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.480" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">essentially pumping itself up to higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">and higher levels of actualization</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">at both at two levels simultaneously the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:05.359" style="s2">and the community i&#39;ve really come to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">like that idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:08.800" style="s2">but let&#39;s move on to another topic my</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">good friend jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.800" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">who i&#39;ve been working with for many</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">years on topics of this sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:15.760" style="s2">has very recently put forth an idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">called sivium</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.760" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">you can uh google it i think he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">four or five or six</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">uh youtube videos on it where he</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">started off with some ideas from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">santa fe institute from jeffrey west and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.720" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">louise bettencourt</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">where they&#39;ve done some very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">work on what they call the super</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">linearity of</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:36.720" style="s2">cities uh to drop back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">jeffrey west in particular with a couple</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:41.920" style="s2">of collaborators the santa fe institute</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:42.560" style="s2">has done a lot of work on the scaling</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.920" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">laws</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.560" end="00:46:46.560" style="s2">of life and it turns out that for</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">animals the scaling law</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.560" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">is about three-quarters which means that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">if you double the size of an animal it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">only consumes</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">two times three-quarters or about a half</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">one and a half</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">times as much energy so animals get more</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:04.240" style="s2">efficient</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">as they get bigger and they move slower</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.240" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">their heartbeats go down you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">famously an elephant the mouse have</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.440" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">about the same number of heartbeats in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:13.040" style="s2">life etc</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">so we can say that animal life is</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.040" end="00:47:17.839" style="s2">sublinear</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">but they then moved and captured data</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.839" end="00:47:20.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">cities and discovered that cities are</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.240" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">super linear</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">at about the level of 1.15 on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">things they measure so if you double the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">size</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">of a city you&#39;ll more than double</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">the size of the number of patents that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">come out</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll also more than double or the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">income will go up the average income</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">will go up as you increase</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">size but it&#39;s also true that the amount</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">of crime will go up and the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">infectious disease like aids will go up</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:49.680" style="s2">and so cities are super linear in both</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:51.359" style="s2">the good and the bad</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.680" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">dimensions there&#39;s a lot of ground</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.359" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">setting and so what</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">jordan has proposed in his civilian civ</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">ium</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">proposal is to let&#39;s see if we can get</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">the best of both of these two things</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:05.920" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">we should basically abandon cities big</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.920" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">big cities</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">as a modus operandi for human life</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.839" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">because the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">super linearities of the bad are just</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">too strong</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">and that we should all live in small</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">communities where we can have really</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:23.440" style="s2">rich personal relationships that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">could live in great physical beauty</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.440" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">probably a lot like the finned horn</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">project or what we call proto-b&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">in the game b world but and here is his</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">big important butt where he then links</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">west and bettencourt is that we should</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">take advantage of the super linearities</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">on things like science and the arts and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">you know every every kind of good thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">by a very intensive networking between</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:54.000" style="s2">answer the question how do we do that in</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">a way that&#39;s congruent with humans and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.000" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">not capturable by marketing</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">but i think that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">you know way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:03.359" style="s2">uh that the city which has gotten us to</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">where we are today in which</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.359" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">tyson yunkaporta talks about he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">cities are bad period</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">can be gotten rid of with the addition</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">thinking somebody&#39;s going to find that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.640" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">very useful that this pandemic is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">dividing people and not</p>

<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:53.440" style="s2">like we had before but with regards to</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a tricky one how do we get from a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:49:58.480" style="s2">to to be because so many people already</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">live in cities</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.480" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">um yes of course like i just recently</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:04.559" style="s2">talked to</p>

<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">wastes and i came up with this very</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">provocative question what&#39;s 149 times</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">as big as the city of london the land</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">needs to sustain itself</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">and so we&#39;re talking land that is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:51.359" style="s2">much the entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:53.119" style="s2">uk just about supporting one city</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.359" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s not sustainable but how</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.119" end="00:50:56.240" style="s2">do we make the transition and and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:58.319" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:50:59.839" style="s2">right now it&#39;s getting really popular</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.319" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">this sort of odl let&#39;s create</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.839" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">regenerative communities and this that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">and the other and then sell them at high</p>

<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">value to people in costa rica and i i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:51:11.119" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">impulse that also happened in the eco</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">village movement it&#39;s like people</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">seeing the world&#39;s unraveling and saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">i want to create my little</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">safe haven somewhere and i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">unless we keep global solidarity in mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">as we</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:29.680" style="s2">engage in those projects it can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">pretty self-serving</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.680" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">but how do we now that suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s open again that conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">previously everybody&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:41.119" style="s2">the already half of humanity lives in</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.680" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">cities and by</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.119" end="00:51:45.839" style="s2">2050 will we have 70 percent in cities</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.160" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll keep growing and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.839" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">depopulation of the land and all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:51.680" style="s2">but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">the pandemic situation is going to make</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">re-question how they want to live but</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:58.079" style="s2">there is an issue about density</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">you can&#39;t all live in this idyllic</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:02.319" style="s2">farming environment where you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">where you have hectares to yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">your family</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:09.520" style="s2">so we i think we need to find ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:10.559" style="s2">of bringing new community structures</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">into the cities</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.559" end="00:52:13.920" style="s2">and collaborations between cities and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:16.559" style="s2">its regions that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.920" end="00:52:17.800" style="s2">for me we haven&#39;t paid enough attention</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.559" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.800" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">re-regionalization and bioregionalism in</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">this context</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2">um patrick eddis wrote a book in 1910 i</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">um cities and evolution and he made the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">point that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">a city needs to be planned within the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">bioregion that he&#39;s that the city is</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">situated in from the mountains to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">sea</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:38.000" style="s2">paying attention to the the local river</p>

<p begin="00:52:38.000" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">all the overlay like he was the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">father of the concept of overlay mapping</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">that ian mccarthy then</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">eventually turned into gis and</p>

<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">came from patrick eddis and he said we</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.720" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">need to know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">the soil series we need to know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">fauna and the flora we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">geology hydrology everything we need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">we can know about our region and where</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">our city is standing</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">and then make our decisions of what to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:08.160" style="s2">develop where based on</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">the integration of all that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.160" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">and the the caretaking</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">of the resource bases that we depend</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:16.319" style="s2">upon yeah and i think and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">really important i always emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:21.760" style="s2">bioregional thinking is hugely important</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">and whether it&#39;s uh in terms of having</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">some diversity within your bioregion</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:27.839" style="s2">like for instance where our farm is</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s mountainous territory and so you</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.839" end="00:53:32.079" style="s2">can actually get some significant</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">diversity around risk of things like</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.079" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">frost or drought</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">by just moving a few miles so if we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:38.960" style="s2">an integrated uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">economy at different elevations and in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.960" end="00:53:42.079" style="s2">couple of different river valleys that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">are close together physically</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.079" end="00:53:45.680" style="s2">if one area is adversely affected</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:47.440" style="s2">another one probably isn&#39;t so we can get</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.680" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">some diversification</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">and hence resilience in our little mini</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.920" end="00:53:53.280" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">by paying attention to the details the</p>

<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">of bioregionalism and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.559" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">absolutely important</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">one area where i get a little geeky and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:06.000" style="s2">the really sensible path but for some</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">it&#39;s always been something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:08.720" style="s2">fascinated me that projects like the</p>

<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:26.559" style="s2">stuff already going on in that space but</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.440" end="00:55:28.480" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.559" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">to pay attention to yeah i&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.480" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">looked into it a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work currently in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:34.000" style="s2">actually feeding people at least not</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.520" end="00:55:36.799" style="s2">even close</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.000" end="00:55:38.240" style="s2">to economically and what it does do the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.799" end="00:55:38.799" style="s2">only thing that you can economically</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.240" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.799" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">in urban farming is greens basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">yeah yeah salad greens can be done</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">economically</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">but the rest just don&#39;t work there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">just too much capital investment per</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">unit of energy conversion so back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">your topic of you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:57.359" style="s2">is there enough land in some places</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">there is like for instance the united</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.359" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:02.400" style="s2">by my rough calculation we have about 20</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">hectares</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.400" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">of land call that 22 acres for each</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:07.760" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s enough even if you assume</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.760" end="00:56:10.480" style="s2">half of it&#39;s not that useful how big is</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">a family in</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.480" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">in that calculation three people okay so</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">it works but</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.720" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">it certainly won&#39;t work in belgium or uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">even the uk i don&#39;t haven&#39;t done the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">numbers for germany but i&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:24.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for germany either</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">there was a reason hitler was looking</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.640" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">for leban&#39;s room right</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">you know many of our highly populated</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">densely populated countries there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:34.000" style="s2">probably not enough i feel like saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">there was a reason for you for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.000" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">ancestors of</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">um the country that is now called the</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">united states to come and steal</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">the land that that country is on yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s true too</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:45.760" style="s2">are you sure that the nationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:48.240" style="s2">pathway of saying oh well</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.760" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">we&#39;d be fine here in america is is is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.240" end="00:56:51.040" style="s2">pathway towards</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">actually addressing the the global</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.040" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">issues where we&#39;re on or do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:56.319" style="s2">not have to start what i was mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:56:57.359" style="s2">earlier that the solidarity at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.319" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">global scale</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.359" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">if you look at ecological footprinting</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">machonicals work in the footprint</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">network we&#39;ve got what 1.68 hectares per</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.640" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">of bioproductive land available slightly</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:11.440" style="s2">different figure</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">yep yep and you know there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.440" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:15.359" style="s2">is the saudi arabia of food right</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">because we have a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.359" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">good land and decent growing weather</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">than we actually need</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">and that was actually my point which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t want a lifeboat theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">where the u.s says or canada or russia</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">for that matter russia could easily be</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:32.559" style="s2">very self-sufficient in food if it</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.640" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">wasn&#39;t such a screwed up mess</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.559" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">you know these countries should not or</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">cannot morally take a lifeboat strategy</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">and say screw everybody else and this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">bioregionalism starts to break down</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">right because we say all right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">going to organize</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">mostly bioregionally well it works where</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:48.880" style="s2">the climate and the land and the soil</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:52.319" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.880" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">population density are right but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.319" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">unfortunately way over</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:58.480" style="s2">shot it&#39;s a goddamn shame that for</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">historical reasons</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.480" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">we ended up peaking at 10 billion rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">than 2 billion</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:05.839" style="s2">at 2 billion we could make a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">stuff work across the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.839" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">but at 8 billion it&#39;s going to require</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">especially if we&#39;re going to be moral</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:14.480" style="s2">and ethical with respect to our global</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">obligations there&#39;s still going to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.480" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">to be a shitload of global trade to keep</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">people from starving to death</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">yeah i mean the numbers thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">more and more research</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">coming out and like if you if you look</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:26.799" style="s2">at the impact that the pandemic is</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">likely to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.799" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">all around the world with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:30.720" style="s2">people&#39;s decision to have children or</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.720" end="00:58:35.280" style="s2">even if it&#39;s for entirely survival</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:36.319" style="s2">economic reasons because they&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.280" end="00:58:38.559" style="s2">depression</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.319" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">i think where we might not even hit the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.559" end="00:58:41.119" style="s2">10 10 billion that were predicted we</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:43.839" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.119" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">actually turn the curve i mean still a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.839" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">lot of people putting a lot of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">on the planet i</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:49.760" style="s2">agree with that statement absolutely but</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:53.200" style="s2">but i i think that</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.760" end="00:58:56.799" style="s2">the likelihood that we will see</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.200" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">a peak around 20 30 20 35</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">and then a continuing decline of um</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:03.680" style="s2">human population</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:04.400" style="s2">is relatively high that would be great</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.680" end="00:59:06.079" style="s2">now the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.400" end="00:59:08.240" style="s2">big question is africa the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">world is clearly on the trend but for</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.240" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.359" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">africa seems to be resisting the trend</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.000" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">that as</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">education and economics improve</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">family sizes go down now they have</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:20.799" style="s2">certainly gone down in africa but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:22.000" style="s2">on a very different curve than in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.799" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.000" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">and truthfully most of the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">growth through the century</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">in the demographic projections have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">do with africa</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">so you know if africa gets more strongly</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:35.680" style="s2">influenced by the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">curves the rest of the world has been on</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.680" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">then then perhaps you&#39;re correct but if</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">probably not yep that&#39;s the thing about</p>

<p begin="00:59:45.440" end="00:59:50.400" style="s2">difficult particularly about the future</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">right but we have to do it let&#39;s go on</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.400" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">to our next topic</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:55.680" style="s2">so one that we uh hinted around in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">first conversation and we were teasing</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.680" end="00:59:57.839" style="s2">each other we never really got into it</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="00:59:59.920" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.839" end="01:00:01.839" style="s2">is consciousness right i think we both</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.920" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">wanted to talk about consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.839" end="01:00:07.119" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have time now consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:08.960" style="s2">my favorite topic it&#39;s what i&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.119" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">probably more time thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:12.960" style="s2">reading</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:14.640" style="s2">writing software writing a hundred pages</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.640" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">for a review article since 2014.</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:22.079" style="s2">and you always have to start is what is</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">it right when someone says consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.079" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a very slippery word</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:30.880" style="s2">and you know i think of it as</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to be an animal inside</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.880" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">the experience</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:36.079" style="s2">of a movie of your own life right you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">know that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:41.599" style="s2">i think of as consciousness and i follow</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">as the closest models not very</p>

<p begin="01:00:51.520" end="01:00:57.359" style="s2">he calls biological naturalism</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">which essentially derives from a very</p>

<p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:04.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.559" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">consciousness is a purely biological</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.720" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">function only found in animals</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:12.559" style="s2">found in all advanced animals and</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:14.000" style="s2">that&#39;s basically it there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.559" end="01:01:16.559" style="s2">magic about it and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.000" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">our understanding of how it arises is</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.559" end="01:01:19.680" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">not complete by any means but he finds</p>

<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">is that consciousness is like digestion</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">they&#39;re both systems that do something</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:36.960" style="s2">they have many different parts to them</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">you can&#39;t point at</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.960" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">something and say this is consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">in the same way you can&#39;t point at</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">something in the body and say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">digestion</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:47.520" style="s2">and they both are operate at high</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:49.839" style="s2">energetic and genetic costs</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.520" end="01:01:51.760" style="s2">to keep them operating and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.839" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">the it simplifies tremendously the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.760" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:56.240" style="s2">about consciousness and i add the rut</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">corollary and searle says</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.240" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">consciousness is like digestion and i</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:01.119" style="s2">say it often produces the same end</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">result</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.119" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">yeah yeah back to our conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:06.799" style="s2">night soil</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">so anyway i would also add at least my</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.799" end="01:02:10.240" style="s2">view on consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">is gerald edelman while i disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.240" end="01:02:13.839" style="s2">some of gerald edelman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">analysis of consciousness i think his</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.839" end="01:02:17.039" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">uh that he makes between primary</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.039" end="01:02:21.280" style="s2">consciousness and extended consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">is hugely important</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.280" end="01:02:24.559" style="s2">he would say that the consciousness of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:28.160" style="s2">dog or</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.559" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">a uh even a reptile is</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.160" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">continuous with human consciousness in</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">that those animals live within a movie</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:36.480" style="s2">of their own</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">life essentially and a censorium of</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.480" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">the various senses that op feels like</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:42.400" style="s2">you&#39;re in it in real time</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:44.160" style="s2">but what they what they all lack minus</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.400" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">perhaps a couple of the highest</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.160" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">animals like elephants whales and great</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:51.520" style="s2">apes</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">is any ability to self-reflect</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.520" end="01:02:57.200" style="s2">to use probably symbolic means to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:58.640" style="s2">able to tell a story about themselves</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.200" end="01:03:01.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s what he calls extended</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.640" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">consciousness and you know i argue that</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.039" end="01:03:04.640" style="s2">while we do see a little bit of that in</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.839" end="01:03:06.880" style="s2">elephants</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.640" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">great apes and perhaps whales it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.880" end="01:03:09.599" style="s2">a teeny bit and it&#39;s really a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">bright line</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.599" end="01:03:13.599" style="s2">between humans something happened</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:15.760" style="s2">between chimps and humans</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.599" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">that ratcheted us up to a whole new</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.760" end="01:03:18.880" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:20.240" style="s2">consciousness probably having to do with</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.880" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">our ability to manipulate</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.240" end="01:03:24.640" style="s2">symbols so what&#39;s your theory of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.440" end="01:03:26.559" style="s2">consciousness or at least your</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.640" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">description of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.559" end="01:03:30.079" style="s2">before we get down to more discussion</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:31.680" style="s2">about what it all means well you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.079" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">make sure we&#39;re sort of on the same page</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.680" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">or or at least if we&#39;re on different</p>

<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:38.079" style="s2">we know what those two pages are yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:38.960" style="s2">i sense we&#39;re possibly on two different</p>

<p begin="01:03:53.599" end="01:03:57.280" style="s2">life and consciousness emerges out of</p>

<p begin="01:06:41.680" end="01:06:46.240" style="s2">whatever that perspective making is with</p>

<p begin="01:06:49.680" end="01:06:53.119" style="s2">and and that&#39;s a very very different</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.599" end="01:06:56.480" style="s2">view of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.119" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">um and again like we can we could now</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.480" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">look back to the earlier conversation of</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.079" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">saying is it scientific because in</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:03.200" style="s2">the world you you were sort of standing</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">more firmly on</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.200" end="01:07:07.039" style="s2">you were saying that the vedanta and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">taoism um</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.039" end="01:07:13.280" style="s2">don&#39;t really qualify as sciences but</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:14.319" style="s2">when you look at how their perspective</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.280" end="01:07:16.480" style="s2">on consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.319" end="01:07:17.839" style="s2">corroborates a lot of the research that</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.480" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">is actually being done</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.839" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">within the confines of western science</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">i think there&#39;s some something to</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:25.599" style="s2">explore there</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:27.760" style="s2">yeah there are things that are certainly</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.599" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">stimulating to the ideas let me uh give</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.760" end="01:07:30.640" style="s2">an alternative way</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.960" end="01:07:32.240" style="s2">and again unfortunately a stand word</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.640" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">consciousness is used</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.240" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">in for so many different things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">really hard to have a precise</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:39.920" style="s2">conversation about it</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:43.599" style="s2">you know uh certainly i agree that</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.920" end="01:07:45.839" style="s2">many kinds of of matter even before life</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.599" end="01:07:48.880" style="s2">and certainly all forms of life</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.839" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">do respond to their environments and in</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.880" end="01:07:51.680" style="s2">what you&#39;d call</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:53.359" style="s2">with competence i guess is the word i</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.680" end="01:07:53.839" style="s2">would like to use and the language we</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.359" end="01:07:55.440" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.839" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">at the santa fe institute is we call</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.440" end="01:07:59.359" style="s2">those complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:00.640" style="s2">systems and frankly there&#39;s even complex</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.359" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">adaptive systems</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.640" end="01:08:04.559" style="s2">in nature uh pre-life you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">sand piles</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.559" end="01:08:10.240" style="s2">or the way asteroids kind of manipulate</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:13.039" style="s2">themselves in their orbits based on</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.240" end="01:08:13.359" style="s2">sunlight and comets and so it&#39;s simple</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:15.039" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.359" end="01:08:17.279" style="s2">they&#39;re complex and they&#39;re adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.039" end="01:08:19.759" style="s2">relatively and certainly a</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.279" end="01:08:20.560" style="s2">sequoia tree is very complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.759" end="01:08:23.440" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.560" end="01:08:24.080" style="s2">and when the snow melts and the sun sun</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.440" end="01:08:25.759" style="s2">comes out</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.080" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">all kinds of different things are</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.759" end="01:08:31.120" style="s2">happening in that tree</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2">but i would argue that you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.120" end="01:08:34.000" style="s2">something&#39;s going on there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.400" end="01:08:36.080" style="s2">communications going on as we know with</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.000" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">the mycelium with other trees not just</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.080" end="01:08:40.880" style="s2">the same species but multiple species</p>

<p begin="01:08:40.880" end="01:08:44.000" style="s2">some of it on real time basis some of it</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.799" end="01:08:46.640" style="s2">lower than real time</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.000" end="01:08:48.880" style="s2">but i would push back and say there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.640" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">movie going on there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.880" end="01:08:55.199" style="s2">being embedded in a real-time sense of</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">being and that is a very specific</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.199" end="01:09:00.319" style="s2">technology that that evolution developed</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">and here&#39;s the interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.319" end="01:09:02.960" style="s2">in fact a book i would strongly</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:03.759" style="s2">recommend to people interested in this</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.960" end="01:09:06.080" style="s2">question</p>

<p begin="01:09:18.719" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">and look at it in terms of evolution and</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.359" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">they argue</p>

<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">consciousness and this</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.520" end="01:09:29.440" style="s2">sense of being in a movie that you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:32.080" style="s2">then at the human level</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.440" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">be self-aware of goes way back at least</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.080" end="01:09:35.279" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:36.159" style="s2">reptiles probably to the amphibians but</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.279" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">maybe no</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.159" end="01:09:39.279" style="s2">no further back than that and that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.480" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">know the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.279" end="01:09:42.719" style="s2">primary consciousness in the edelman</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:44.400" style="s2">speak has more or less</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.719" end="01:09:45.600" style="s2">just continuously evolved and gotten</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:47.120" style="s2">better and different you know for</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.600" end="01:09:49.839" style="s2">instance our dog</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.120" end="01:09:50.719" style="s2">has a much better consciousness of smell</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.839" end="01:09:53.520" style="s2">than we do</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.719" end="01:09:54.159" style="s2">while we have a a better consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.520" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">of vision</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.159" end="01:09:58.560" style="s2">for instance and a hawk has better</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.320" end="01:10:00.640" style="s2">consciousness of vision than we do</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.560" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">but no consciousness of smell at all and</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.640" end="01:10:03.199" style="s2">then to you know follow thomas nagel and</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:05.920" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.199" end="01:10:08.080" style="s2">work on what&#39;s it like to be a bat bat</p>

<p begin="01:10:08.080" end="01:10:11.920" style="s2">that we can&#39;t even understand right</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.840" end="01:10:13.520" style="s2">but anyway those things we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.920" end="01:10:17.199" style="s2">look at their evolution</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.520" end="01:10:20.320" style="s2">and they are different than</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.199" end="01:10:22.880" style="s2">the state of being of even life</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.320" end="01:10:23.840" style="s2">prior to that like a sponge does not</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.880" end="01:10:26.239" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.840" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">anything like being in a movie now</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.239" end="01:10:29.199" style="s2">here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:31.360" style="s2">thing that i just found amazing in this</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.199" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">book they posit and provide some</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">that this this idea of consciousness as</p>

<p begin="01:10:36.480" end="01:10:40.560" style="s2">actually evolved at least twice once</p>

<p begin="01:10:46.640" end="01:10:49.400" style="s2">connected because there was a big</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.920" end="01:10:52.880" style="s2">evolutionary gap</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.400" end="01:10:54.239" style="s2">encephalopods meaning octopi and some of</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.880" end="01:10:56.480" style="s2">the larger squid</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.239" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">octopi in particular show an awful lot</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.480" end="01:10:59.199" style="s2">of signs of being conscious</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">even though they&#39;re not related there</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.199" end="01:11:02.960" style="s2">was a big big gap between these two</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:06.159" style="s2">trees of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.960" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">so it may indeed say that there is</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.159" end="01:11:11.840" style="s2">a tendency to find consciousness in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.120" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">evolution of life like</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.840" end="01:11:15.440" style="s2">but there is still a pretty clear line</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:17.120" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:18.880" style="s2">those consciousnesses even if they</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.120" end="01:11:21.760" style="s2">evolve separately</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.880" end="01:11:22.719" style="s2">in the prior world of complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.760" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.719" end="01:11:27.920" style="s2">well yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s tricky to build</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">on the conversation because it because</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.920" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">it it&#39;s just one particular lens into</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">consciousness that that i personally</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:37.360" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">difficult to connect with because</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.360" end="01:11:40.400" style="s2">the true participatory consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:43.199" style="s2">that also</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.400" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">draws like pays attention to how we</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.199" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">bring forth the world based on</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:51.440" style="s2">the modes of explanation we use</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:53.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t isn&#39;t really acknowledged in in</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.440" end="01:11:55.360" style="s2">that to my mind</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.440" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to get it is like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.360" end="01:11:59.760" style="s2">the word that uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.760" end="01:12:00.880" style="s2">the work that henry bortoff has done um</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.760" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">based on</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.880" end="01:12:04.080" style="s2">gertie and phenomenology he writes like</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.120" end="01:12:05.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve just found</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.080" end="01:12:07.520" style="s2">as you were speaking i found this quote</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.600" end="01:12:09.760" style="s2">that that again points to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.520" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">where i&#39;m coming from the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:13.280" style="s2">discovery on</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:14.719" style="s2">um on which phenomenology is based is</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.280" end="01:12:17.199" style="s2">that consciousness has a</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.719" end="01:12:18.719" style="s2">structure of intentionality it would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.199" end="01:12:20.000" style="s2">better to say that consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.719" end="01:12:22.000" style="s2">intentionality</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.000" end="01:12:24.239" style="s2">this is often expressed by saying that</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.000" end="01:12:26.080" style="s2">consciousness is always conscious of</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.239" end="01:12:28.960" style="s2">something in other words consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.080" end="01:12:31.920" style="s2">is always directed towards an object</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.960" end="01:12:32.640" style="s2">hence in cognitive perception there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.920" end="01:12:34.880" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.640" end="01:12:36.320" style="s2">the soluble unity between the conscious</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.880" end="01:12:38.800" style="s2">mind and the object</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.320" end="01:12:40.480" style="s2">of which it is conscious and that means</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.800" end="01:12:43.360" style="s2">that if we think of the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.480" end="01:12:44.159" style="s2">in the in terms of solid objects and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.360" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">atoms</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.159" end="01:12:47.440" style="s2">and matter then we bring forth a</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.480" end="01:12:49.520" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:52.080" style="s2">connection to that world than if we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.520" end="01:12:55.600" style="s2">a truly participatory consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.080" end="01:12:55.920" style="s2">of entertaining that we are reflections</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.600" end="01:12:57.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.920" end="01:12:59.440" style="s2">that world through the act of</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.920" end="01:13:00.800" style="s2">perspective taking</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.440" end="01:13:02.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any disagreement</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.800" end="01:13:04.320" style="s2">there actually in fact john searle</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.880" end="01:13:06.159" style="s2">wrote a very good book called</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.320" end="01:13:08.320" style="s2">intentional he also wrote a great book</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.159" end="01:13:10.560" style="s2">called mind a brief introduction</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.320" end="01:13:13.120" style="s2">which talks about how consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.560" end="01:13:14.880" style="s2">intentionality are utterly interwoven</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.120" end="01:13:16.480" style="s2">right and that you really can&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.880" end="01:13:18.239" style="s2">about consciousness without also</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.480" end="01:13:20.320" style="s2">thinking about intentionality in our</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.239" end="01:13:21.440" style="s2">relationship between the subjective and</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.320" end="01:13:23.199" style="s2">the objective</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.440" end="01:13:24.640" style="s2">and i don&#39;t see any conflict there</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.199" end="01:13:26.320" style="s2">actually which is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.640" end="01:13:28.080" style="s2">which is which gets me to the second</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.320" end="01:13:29.440" style="s2">usage of the word consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.080" end="01:13:31.600" style="s2">maybe here is where we get</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.440" end="01:13:33.520" style="s2">into more agreement or at least we find</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.600" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">more interesting disagreements</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.520" end="01:13:36.960" style="s2">you know particularly in things like</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">integral and</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.960" end="01:13:41.120" style="s2">buddhism etc they use consciousness in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:43.600" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.120" end="01:13:44.480" style="s2">as well which is not about are you in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.600" end="01:13:46.000" style="s2">movie of</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.480" end="01:13:47.600" style="s2">the experience of your life and</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.000" end="01:13:48.960" style="s2">interacting intentionally with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.600" end="01:13:51.520" style="s2">objects in that movie</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.960" end="01:13:53.120" style="s2">but rather kind of a level of perception</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.520" end="01:13:54.960" style="s2">thing and some of this goes into</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.120" end="01:13:55.760" style="s2">developmental psychology as well you</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.960" end="01:13:58.320" style="s2">know when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.760" end="01:13:59.760" style="s2">when we&#39;re small we&#39;re very egocentric</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.320" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">and then we start to have a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.760" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:03.440" style="s2">our mother and then to our family and</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:05.679" style="s2">then our community</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.440" end="01:14:07.280" style="s2">and then as we grow older probably our</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.679" end="01:14:09.840" style="s2">tribe or our culture</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.280" end="01:14:11.520" style="s2">and then some people uh achieve what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.840" end="01:14:13.040" style="s2">often called a global level of</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.520" end="01:14:14.880" style="s2">consciousness where they</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.040" end="01:14:17.120" style="s2">are able to actually think about the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.880" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">world as a whole and some people claim i</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.120" end="01:14:20.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they can really get their</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.480" end="01:14:24.159" style="s2">universal consciousness where they can</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.640" end="01:14:27.679" style="s2">think in terms of the whole universe</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.159" end="01:14:30.800" style="s2">and certainly that kind of development</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.679" end="01:14:31.440" style="s2">psychological development happens in</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.800" end="01:14:32.719" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.440" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">and if we want to call that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.719" end="01:14:35.760" style="s2">consciousness that may be a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:37.600" style="s2">closer</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.760" end="01:14:38.800" style="s2">to some of the concerns that you were</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.600" end="01:14:42.480" style="s2">just expressing</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.800" end="01:14:45.199" style="s2">yeah i mean definitely that i i find</p>

<p begin="01:14:45.199" end="01:14:48.800" style="s2">states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.400" end="01:14:50.239" style="s2">quite a useful map of how we&#39;ve in</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.800" end="01:14:52.560" style="s2">different ways talked about</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.239" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">consciousness and and the evolution of</p>

<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:58.719" style="s2">but it also has the the danger as</p>

<p begin="01:14:58.719" end="01:15:01.760" style="s2">community is that people get kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.560" end="01:15:03.679" style="s2">little bit too tied up</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.760" end="01:15:05.280" style="s2">in the nomenclature that they&#39;ve then</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.679" end="01:15:07.199" style="s2">developed um or</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.840" end="01:15:18.159" style="s2">for me that</p>

<p begin="01:16:18.000" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">henry bortoff described it as a holistic</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.280" end="01:16:25.920" style="s2">mode of consciousness that is</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:28.400" style="s2">complementary um to the analytical one</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.920" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">but but but not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.400" end="01:16:31.760" style="s2">commensurable yeah we&#39;ll see i mean uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:35.120" style="s2">there is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.760" end="01:16:37.280" style="s2">rapidly growing western science of</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.120" end="01:16:38.800" style="s2">consciousness and it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.280" end="01:16:40.320" style="s2">i know some of the more serious</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.800" end="01:16:42.239" style="s2">scientists in that realm and most of</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.320" end="01:16:44.880" style="s2">them are very interested in and</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.239" end="01:16:45.679" style="s2">are practitioners of eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.880" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.679" end="01:16:49.040" style="s2">and so they uh sam harris being one</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:51.120" style="s2">well-known one</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.040" end="01:16:52.320" style="s2">but there are plenty of others and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:54.960" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.320" end="01:16:56.800" style="s2">contradictory but i do suspect that if</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.960" end="01:16:58.000" style="s2">the cognitive science of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.800" end="01:17:00.640" style="s2">continues</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.000" end="01:17:02.159" style="s2">we may well actually be able to explain</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.640" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.159" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">even of a holistic perspective</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:08.400" style="s2">from a cognitive neuroscience point of</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:10.000" style="s2">view yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.400" end="01:17:11.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what i mean that that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.000" end="01:17:13.120" style="s2">keyboard is continuous that like we</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.760" end="01:17:15.920" style="s2">normally do find</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.120" end="01:17:16.480" style="s2">um these areas of overlap where suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.920" end="01:17:19.280" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.480" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">breaking any of the axioms or rules and</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.280" end="01:17:22.880" style="s2">methodologies</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.239" end="01:17:24.480" style="s2">of the wonderful tool that is and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.880" end="01:17:27.920" style="s2">valuable tool that is western</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.480" end="01:17:30.480" style="s2">science then suddenly pushes into</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.920" end="01:17:31.520" style="s2">areas that describe in their language</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.480" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">something that other</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.520" end="01:17:35.760" style="s2">i would still call them sciences have</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.360" end="01:17:37.440" style="s2">described sometimes millennia ago</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.760" end="01:17:38.960" style="s2">in a different language this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.440" end="01:17:40.560" style="s2">interesting because this is this is what</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.960" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">has to happen somehow because</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.560" end="01:17:44.560" style="s2">i&#39;m more and more convinced that there</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">is no real argument here there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.560" end="01:17:48.320" style="s2">an entanglement with words</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:49.520" style="s2">and i don&#39;t really feel like i&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.320" end="01:17:50.400" style="s2">all the way through because obviously i</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.520" end="01:17:52.800" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.400" end="01:17:54.239" style="s2">initially a very extreme materialist</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.800" end="01:17:56.080" style="s2">realist perspective</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.239" end="01:17:58.640" style="s2">as i&#39;ve learned more about consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.080" end="01:18:00.960" style="s2">and have done some dabbling in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.640" end="01:18:03.040" style="s2">other ways of thinking i can sort of</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.960" end="01:18:03.760" style="s2">feel that somehow they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:07.199" style="s2">but that</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.760" end="01:18:09.120" style="s2">uh synthesis has not yet uh been done</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.199" end="01:18:11.120" style="s2">but now to bring us back to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.120" end="01:18:13.760" style="s2">where we were trying to get to earlier</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.120" end="01:18:14.480" style="s2">which is this how the human has to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.760" end="01:18:17.120" style="s2">upgraded</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.480" end="01:18:17.920" style="s2">probably to achieve uh regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.120" end="01:18:19.679" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.920" end="01:18:21.280" style="s2">before we go there just briefly because</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.679" end="01:18:22.080" style="s2">it kind of makes the link to where</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.280" end="01:18:24.719" style="s2">you&#39;re going now</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.080" end="01:18:26.880" style="s2">um well okay you know that batson</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.719" end="01:18:30.080" style="s2">famously said the biggest problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.880" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">for of humanity come from the difference</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.080" end="01:18:33.440" style="s2">in the way that humans think in the way</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2">that nature like more than</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.440" end="01:18:37.239" style="s2">more than human nature thinks and he</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.600" end="01:18:40.320" style="s2">also pointed towards this</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.239" end="01:18:42.800" style="s2">misunderstanding of mind and and</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.320" end="01:18:44.080" style="s2">um just want to read one more henry</p>

<p begin="01:19:04.400" end="01:19:08.640" style="s2">migraine of my life and for 48 hours was</p>

<p begin="01:19:18.640" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">writes</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.440" end="01:19:24.560" style="s2">we miss the dimension of mind</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.560" end="01:19:25.840" style="s2">which is active in our lives the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.560" end="01:19:28.960" style="s2">dimension of mind</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.840" end="01:19:30.159" style="s2">in cognitive perception is as invisible</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.960" end="01:19:32.159" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.159" end="01:19:33.199" style="s2">to begin with as the movement of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.159" end="01:19:35.840" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.199" end="01:19:37.520" style="s2">just as it seems so evident to us that</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.840" end="01:19:40.560" style="s2">everything we see about us</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.520" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">is just there i.e objects instead of</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.560" end="01:19:43.760" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:45.120" style="s2">and that cognitive perception is just</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.760" end="01:19:47.360" style="s2">sense perception</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.120" end="01:19:50.159" style="s2">we are accustomed to thinking of mind as</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.360" end="01:19:51.600" style="s2">if it were inside of us in our heads but</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.159" end="01:19:54.320" style="s2">it is the other way around</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.600" end="01:19:56.800" style="s2">we live within a dimension of mind which</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.320" end="01:19:59.679" style="s2">is for the most part as invisible to us</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.800" end="01:20:01.679" style="s2">as the air we breathe we usually only</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.679" end="01:20:04.920" style="s2">discover it when it breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.679" end="01:20:06.159" style="s2">i think that speaks to that shift in</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.920" end="01:20:09.520" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.159" end="01:20:13.360" style="s2">of of um maybe consciousness is primary</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.520" end="01:20:15.360" style="s2">and matter evolves out of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.360" end="01:20:17.440" style="s2">yeah i would reject that but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.360" end="01:20:18.719" style="s2">two-hour conversation right there but we</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.440" end="01:20:21.040" style="s2">put it on the table</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.719" end="01:20:21.920" style="s2">but i will agree with the fact that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.040" end="01:20:24.880" style="s2">know we</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.920" end="01:20:26.159" style="s2">are not our mind consciousness is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.880" end="01:20:28.800" style="s2">relatively small</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.159" end="01:20:30.719" style="s2">specialized sub-function of the mind in</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.800" end="01:20:32.719" style="s2">fact those of us who have had things</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.719" end="01:20:34.960" style="s2">like ego death experiences</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.719" end="01:20:37.040" style="s2">know that you can be alive and walking</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.960" end="01:20:40.560" style="s2">around in the world without any eye</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.040" end="01:20:41.760" style="s2">right and so the mind is way way deeper</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:43.840" style="s2">than the ego</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.760" end="01:20:44.960" style="s2">and you know most of the mind most of</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.840" end="01:20:47.040" style="s2">the brain at least</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.960" end="01:20:49.120" style="s2">is spent on lower level things like</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.040" end="01:20:50.480" style="s2">processing perception keeping your heart</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.120" end="01:20:52.560" style="s2">beating etc</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.480" end="01:20:53.600" style="s2">and the uh you know the part that</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.560" end="01:20:57.199" style="s2">supports</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.600" end="01:21:00.480" style="s2">consciousness is maybe 20 of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.199" end="01:21:02.960" style="s2">and but it utterly relies upon that</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.480" end="01:21:04.000" style="s2">iceberg beneath the surface and even the</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.960" end="01:21:05.600" style="s2">part that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.000" end="01:21:07.760" style="s2">involved with creating consciousness we</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.600" end="01:21:10.400" style="s2">have no ability to see into it</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.760" end="01:21:11.520" style="s2">we only experience this higher realm of</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.400" end="01:21:13.600" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.520" end="01:21:15.440" style="s2">we have no idea what the working parts</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.600" end="01:21:17.600" style="s2">are going on underneath unless we work</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.440" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">very very very very hard which i think</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.600" end="01:21:21.360" style="s2">is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:23.199" style="s2">but back to this where i was uh heading</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.360" end="01:21:25.199" style="s2">to go which is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.199" end="01:21:27.520" style="s2">i think yourself for sure and lots of</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.199" end="01:21:29.679" style="s2">other people and increasingly myself</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.520" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">have come around to the view that</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.679" end="01:21:34.320" style="s2">raising</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:34.960" style="s2">consciousness away above the ego and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.320" end="01:21:37.440" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.960" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">to the global and the planetary and in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.440" end="01:21:42.800" style="s2">more holistic fashion</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.360" end="01:21:45.360" style="s2">is going to be part of helping humans</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.800" end="01:21:47.360" style="s2">organize themselves so as to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.360" end="01:21:51.120" style="s2">reach a regenerative culture</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.360" end="01:21:53.920" style="s2">yes and yeah in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.120" end="01:21:54.960" style="s2">i definitely fall into that category of</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.920" end="01:21:57.280" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.960" end="01:21:58.080" style="s2">somehow believing that that will make a</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.280" end="01:22:00.480" style="s2">big difference</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.080" end="01:22:01.679" style="s2">and at the same time i&#39;m not quite sure</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.480" end="01:22:03.520" style="s2">whether</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.679" end="01:22:05.520" style="s2">the view that we just need to get</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.520" end="01:22:07.199" style="s2">everybody to agree and understand this</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.520" end="01:22:09.280" style="s2">and then everything will be fine</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.199" end="01:22:10.800" style="s2">is is probably a bit limited as well</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.280" end="01:22:11.280" style="s2">like coming back to the the world of</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.800" end="01:22:14.080" style="s2">homes</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.280" end="01:22:15.520" style="s2">matrix and and these the kind of map of</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.080" end="01:22:17.440" style="s2">different world views</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.520" end="01:22:19.199" style="s2">i think we need to have the whole whole</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.440" end="01:22:20.080" style="s2">spectrum open all the time because there</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.199" end="01:22:22.320" style="s2">will always be</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.080" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">people moving through that developmental</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.320" end="01:22:26.320" style="s2">spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:27.840" style="s2">and and so we need to find a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.320" end="01:22:29.600" style="s2">that speaks to people</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.840" end="01:22:31.600" style="s2">at all the different levels of</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.600" end="01:22:34.639" style="s2">consciousness and still</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.600" end="01:22:36.880" style="s2">includes the meta narrative</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.639" end="01:22:38.239" style="s2">that is say saying like okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.880" end="01:22:40.800" style="s2">wonderful let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.239" end="01:22:41.760" style="s2">acknowledge that all our disagreements</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.800" end="01:22:44.000" style="s2">of perspective</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.760" end="01:22:46.159" style="s2">are part of biodiversity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.000" end="01:22:48.239" style="s2">wonderful that&#39;s where the creativity of</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.159" end="01:22:49.600" style="s2">our species comes from that we have</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.239" end="01:22:52.239" style="s2">different points of view</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.600" end="01:22:53.280" style="s2">and we&#39;re now at a point where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.239" end="01:22:57.120" style="s2">so many of us</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.280" end="01:22:58.000" style="s2">on a planet with a life support system</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.120" end="01:23:01.360" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.000" end="01:23:01.760" style="s2">put in jeopardy that we need to agree on</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.360" end="01:23:04.960" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.760" end="01:23:06.960" style="s2">basic commonalities with regard to not</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.960" end="01:23:08.000" style="s2">infringing on ecosystems and planetary</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.960" end="01:23:09.840" style="s2">health and</p>

<p begin="01:23:11.760" end="01:23:15.120" style="s2">and and that&#39;s that&#39;s what we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.000" end="01:23:16.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.120" end="01:23:18.880" style="s2">everybody to agree with us and</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.719" end="01:23:20.320" style="s2">suddenly move from kind of egocentric to</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.880" end="01:23:23.239" style="s2">tribal centric and</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.320" end="01:23:25.520" style="s2">to to nation-centric and then on to</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.239" end="01:23:26.639" style="s2">planetary consciousness and cosmic</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.520" end="01:23:28.480" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.639" end="01:23:29.679" style="s2">we don&#39;t have necessary time for</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.480" end="01:23:30.960" style="s2">achieving that</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.679" end="01:23:32.800" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t think we have any</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.960" end="01:23:34.239" style="s2">disagreement there you know i think i</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.800" end="01:23:35.440" style="s2">was speaking in the most general of</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.239" end="01:23:37.120" style="s2">terms but i am</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.440" end="01:23:39.920" style="s2">very strong about the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.120" end="01:23:41.760" style="s2">to acknowledge high diversity in humans</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.920" end="01:23:44.880" style="s2">in many dimensions from</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.760" end="01:23:45.600" style="s2">pure cognitive ability to values to how</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.880" end="01:23:47.520" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.600" end="01:23:49.360" style="s2">address issues that we would call</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.520" end="01:23:51.600" style="s2">spirituality etc</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.360" end="01:23:53.040" style="s2">and that any attempt to squash out that</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.600" end="01:23:56.080" style="s2">uh diversity</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.040" end="01:23:58.480" style="s2">is exceedingly dangerous and results in</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.080" end="01:23:59.600" style="s2">horror shows like nazism or marxist</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.480" end="01:24:01.679" style="s2">leninism</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.600" end="01:24:03.760" style="s2">and in fact the words i&#39;ve created to</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.679" end="01:24:07.040" style="s2">express that concept is coherent</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.760" end="01:24:08.639" style="s2">pluralism uh there&#39;s some things that it</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.040" end="01:24:10.400" style="s2">is important that we agree about like</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.639" end="01:24:11.600" style="s2">for instance we live in a limited world</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.400" end="01:24:12.639" style="s2">at least at our current level of</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.600" end="01:24:14.639" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.639" end="01:24:16.320" style="s2">and that if we exceed the limits bad</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.639" end="01:24:16.960" style="s2">things are going to happen but on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.320" end="01:24:19.679" style="s2">other hand</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.960" end="01:24:20.719" style="s2">we have to leave room for lots of ways</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.679" end="01:24:23.199" style="s2">for people to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.719" end="01:24:24.800" style="s2">people and evolve cultures that live</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.199" end="01:24:27.440" style="s2">within those limits</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.800" end="01:24:28.880" style="s2">and in terms of the idea that not</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.440" end="01:24:30.719" style="s2">everyone is going to be at the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.880" end="01:24:32.800" style="s2">level that&#39;s also obviously true</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.719" end="01:24:34.239" style="s2">and a thinker i&#39;ve i&#39;ve recently become</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.800" end="01:24:37.199" style="s2">very interested in</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.239" end="01:24:38.080" style="s2">he goes it&#39;s actually a two people</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.199" end="01:24:41.120" style="s2">writing team</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.080" end="01:24:44.159" style="s2">called hanzi frank that&#39;s a pseudonym</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.120" end="01:24:45.760" style="s2">and they write a whole lot about</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.159" end="01:24:47.440" style="s2">the fact that people are going to be at</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.760" end="01:24:48.960" style="s2">different levels and they and they make</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:50.080" style="s2">some distinctions which i find very</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.960" end="01:24:52.000" style="s2">useful between</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.080" end="01:24:53.360" style="s2">hierarchical complexity which you can</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.000" end="01:24:56.239" style="s2">sort of think about as</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.360" end="01:24:57.440" style="s2">iq ish but then he also adds the very</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.239" end="01:25:00.000" style="s2">important concept of</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.440" end="01:25:01.840" style="s2">code which is the the details of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.000" end="01:25:04.719" style="s2">social operating system</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.840" end="01:25:06.159" style="s2">and then they talk about state which are</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.719" end="01:25:07.199" style="s2">the ability to reach these higher</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.159" end="01:25:10.400" style="s2">consciousnesses</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.199" end="01:25:12.480" style="s2">which will vary by people and then depth</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.400" end="01:25:14.960" style="s2">which is what are the range of these</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.480" end="01:25:15.360" style="s2">states that a person has experienced in</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.960" end="01:25:17.920" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.360" end="01:25:19.040" style="s2">lives and they say we have to realize</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.920" end="01:25:20.560" style="s2">that people are going to vary on all</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.040" end="01:25:24.159" style="s2">four of these dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.560" end="01:25:26.719" style="s2">but we can work towards moving humanity</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.159" end="01:25:28.080" style="s2">up in all four dimensions as a way to</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.719" end="01:25:30.400" style="s2">get ourselves ready</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.080" end="01:25:31.440" style="s2">for essentially a regenerative culture</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.400" end="01:25:33.120" style="s2">i&#39;m familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.440" end="01:25:35.120" style="s2">their framework and i i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.120" end="01:25:35.760" style="s2">until just now that behind hansi frein</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.120" end="01:25:37.679" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.760" end="01:25:39.040" style="s2">two people rather than one person and</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.679" end="01:25:40.639" style="s2">that it was a pseudonym</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.040" end="01:25:42.960" style="s2">but it reminds me a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.639" end="01:25:43.520" style="s2">wilbur&#39;s um lines of development and i</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.960" end="01:25:46.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.520" end="01:25:48.560" style="s2">certainly realized that a lot in in kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.320" end="01:25:51.360" style="s2">of collaborative projects and so on that</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.560" end="01:25:53.360" style="s2">there is a distinction between um that</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.360" end="01:25:54.960" style="s2">kind of what will we call the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.360" end="01:25:56.719" style="s2">line like thinking yourself into</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.960" end="01:25:57.840" style="s2">enlightenment and this this higher level</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.719" end="01:26:01.440" style="s2">of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.840" end="01:26:05.440" style="s2">and all its benefits and then actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.440" end="01:26:08.880" style="s2">having that also in your um fully</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.440" end="01:26:09.199" style="s2">embodied um kinesthetic development line</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.880" end="01:26:12.639" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.199" end="01:26:13.760" style="s2">in your like in your somatosexual line</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.639" end="01:26:15.760" style="s2">or your</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.760" end="01:26:17.040" style="s2">your spiritual development line so they</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.760" end="01:26:20.159" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.040" end="01:26:21.120" style="s2">um slightly different areas of our</p>

<p begin="01:26:21.120" end="01:26:25.040" style="s2">and that sometimes we we can just throw</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.199" end="01:26:27.520" style="s2">this grappling hook</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.040" end="01:26:28.560" style="s2">way ahead and pull us with the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.520" end="01:26:31.040" style="s2">line towards</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.560" end="01:26:32.400" style="s2">um areas that that we haven&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.040" end="01:26:35.120" style="s2">integrated in</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.400" end="01:26:35.440" style="s2">in the whole human being sense and</p>

<p begin="01:26:35.440" end="01:26:38.800" style="s2">that&#39;s where i personally and this might</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.199" end="01:26:41.199" style="s2">be a complete like my own</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.800" end="01:26:43.520" style="s2">my own story and my own limitations here</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.199" end="01:26:45.120" style="s2">i i sometimes find</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.520" end="01:26:46.800" style="s2">there comes a point when it gets too</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.120" end="01:26:50.000" style="s2">analytical and too mappy</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.800" end="01:26:52.320" style="s2">and too um how do we</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.000" end="01:26:53.600" style="s2">create the process that everybody can</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.320" end="01:26:56.800" style="s2">evolve faster</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.600" end="01:27:00.320" style="s2">that that i i just recoil</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.800" end="01:27:01.360" style="s2">because i kind of appreciate the chaos</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.320" end="01:27:04.560" style="s2">the not knowing</p>

<p begin="01:27:04.560" end="01:27:10.320" style="s2">and how they alternate and um</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.159" end="01:27:11.840" style="s2">and the the kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.320" end="01:27:14.000" style="s2">cognitive sense making</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.840" end="01:27:15.280" style="s2">but then also really giving value to</p>

<p begin="01:27:52.880" end="01:27:56.159" style="s2">even in uh you know again cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.719" end="01:27:59.280" style="s2">science we know from work</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.159" end="01:28:00.960" style="s2">by antonio damasio that almost all of</p>

<p begin="01:28:01.679" end="01:28:05.679" style="s2">right we we build these great cosmic</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.159" end="01:28:06.400" style="s2">frameworks right but at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.679" end="01:28:07.920" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.400" end="01:28:09.520" style="s2">something deep underneath which we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.920" end="01:28:11.600" style="s2">even understand is the one that</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.520" end="01:28:12.639" style="s2">tilts the needle to our actual decisions</p>

<p begin="01:28:12.639" end="01:28:15.920" style="s2">i think the merit of jordan hall&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.560" end="01:28:18.159" style="s2">scivium idea</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.920" end="01:28:19.440" style="s2">let&#39;s make sure we&#39;re situated in</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.159" end="01:28:22.560" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.440" end="01:28:23.760" style="s2">supportive low risk or at least low risk</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.560" end="01:28:27.120" style="s2">of starving</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.760" end="01:28:30.080" style="s2">places so that our emotions are not</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.120" end="01:28:32.400" style="s2">over amped and not overexposed to mass</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.080" end="01:28:33.520" style="s2">media and advertising etc and then i do</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.400" end="01:28:35.520" style="s2">believe that our</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.520" end="01:28:37.199" style="s2">you know organic bodies are pretty damn</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.520" end="01:28:39.199" style="s2">good at making good decisions</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.199" end="01:28:40.719" style="s2">yeah i mean what jordan is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.199" end="01:28:42.480" style="s2">recreating with this vision</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.719" end="01:28:44.239" style="s2">is a bit like the buddhist notions of</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.480" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">the buddha the dharma and the sangha</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.239" end="01:28:48.159" style="s2">um like basically the sangha is the</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">community that keeps you on the path</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.159" end="01:28:52.000" style="s2">the the dharma is the developmental</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.400" end="01:28:53.920" style="s2">impulse like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.000" end="01:28:56.000" style="s2">grow individual consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.920" end="01:28:58.000" style="s2">community consciousness at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.000" end="01:28:59.840" style="s2">and the buddha is nothing but that</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.000" end="01:29:01.600" style="s2">people can do this and that there are</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.840" end="01:29:02.400" style="s2">people who have done it before that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.600" end="01:29:05.040" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.400" end="01:29:06.000" style="s2">refer to to basically feel like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.040" end="01:29:08.400" style="s2">a futile</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.000" end="01:29:10.239" style="s2">exercise to to get to these states do</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.400" end="01:29:13.040" style="s2">you think that that&#39;s that&#39;s somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.239" end="01:29:14.800" style="s2">related i truthfully hadn&#39;t made that</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.040" end="01:29:16.159" style="s2">connection but now that you mention it i</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.800" end="01:29:16.960" style="s2">do see it i&#39;m gonna have to think about</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.159" end="01:29:18.719" style="s2">that a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.960" end="01:29:20.320" style="s2">right we&#39;re getting late on time here</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.719" end="01:29:21.520" style="s2">it&#39;s been a wonderful conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.320" end="01:29:24.560" style="s2">even though it&#39;s part two</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.520" end="01:29:27.120" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna skip over a few things and</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.560" end="01:29:29.120" style="s2">because i am also with you strongly that</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.120" end="01:29:31.840" style="s2">we can&#39;t overthink this we got to do</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.120" end="01:29:33.600" style="s2">stuff right time is marching on if we</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.840" end="01:29:35.920" style="s2">don&#39;t solve these problems</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.600" end="01:29:37.760" style="s2">uh the meta crisis as we call it in game</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.920" end="01:29:39.840" style="s2">b by 2100</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.760" end="01:29:41.120" style="s2">yes planet earth and life will keep</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.840" end="01:29:44.320" style="s2">marching on but</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.120" end="01:29:46.400" style="s2">life for homo sapiens will not be good</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.320" end="01:29:48.239" style="s2">and that merely raising people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.400" end="01:29:50.320" style="s2">consciousness ain&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.239" end="01:29:52.480" style="s2">no absolutely not that but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.320" end="01:29:53.840" style="s2">why like now remember</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.480" end="01:29:56.080" style="s2">something that you said earlier when you</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.840" end="01:29:58.239" style="s2">mentioned jordan&#39;s work that i wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.080" end="01:29:59.120" style="s2">pick up on which is a dynamic that i</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.239" end="01:30:00.719" style="s2">think we find</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.120" end="01:30:02.000" style="s2">more and more is that at the level what</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.719" end="01:30:03.600" style="s2">you were saying like and then these</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.000" end="01:30:06.000" style="s2">communities need to connect and</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.600" end="01:30:07.920" style="s2">and work together this this like how</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.000" end="01:30:11.280" style="s2">much energy do we put</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.920" end="01:30:13.040" style="s2">into re-patterning our entire way</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.280" end="01:30:14.480" style="s2">not just of thinking and doing things</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.040" end="01:30:16.400" style="s2">but our entire way of</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.480" end="01:30:17.600" style="s2">being with this world and with each</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.400" end="01:30:20.960" style="s2">other um</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.600" end="01:30:24.000" style="s2">at the local and regional scale which</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.960" end="01:30:26.000" style="s2">is a very personal development bit in</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.000" end="01:30:26.960" style="s2">one way but then it becomes a very kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.000" end="01:30:29.280" style="s2">of skilled</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.960" end="01:30:30.159" style="s2">social facilitation of multi-stakeholder</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.280" end="01:30:32.880" style="s2">processes and</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.159" end="01:30:34.480" style="s2">and the and the frustrating complexity</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.880" end="01:30:35.760" style="s2">of working with the real world</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.480" end="01:30:38.480" style="s2">when you when you have to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.760" end="01:30:40.639" style="s2">planners and and local authority and and</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.560" end="01:31:00.000" style="s2">this process and reflecting on how do we</p>

<p begin="01:31:12.080" end="01:31:15.760" style="s2">i have seen certainly in the networks</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.239" end="01:31:18.719" style="s2">that i&#39;m moving is</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.760" end="01:31:20.000" style="s2">a sort of tension between how much</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.719" end="01:31:21.360" style="s2">energy to put where</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.000" end="01:31:23.440" style="s2">and and that one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.360" end="01:31:23.760" style="s2">exercises we where i guess we all need</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.440" end="01:31:26.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.760" end="01:31:30.320" style="s2">um do is is where to put our energies</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.800" end="01:31:34.000" style="s2">um and and what to prioritize and um</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.320" end="01:31:36.719" style="s2">in my life i i feel like i&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.000" end="01:31:39.440" style="s2">a few too many hours on webinars</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.719" end="01:31:42.840" style="s2">podcasts social media and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.440" end="01:31:45.520" style="s2">connecting and learning and and weaving</p>

<p begin="01:31:47.679" end="01:31:52.080" style="s2">but i since my book came out in 2016</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.400" end="01:31:55.520" style="s2">have noticed a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.080" end="01:31:58.960" style="s2">a distraction through all that away</p>

<p begin="01:34:18.400" end="01:34:22.080" style="s2">and they actually mean building it on</p>

<p begin="01:34:22.080" end="01:34:24.960" style="s2">we talk about you know</p>

<p begin="01:34:24.960" end="01:34:29.120" style="s2">include meditation</p>

<p begin="01:34:36.400" end="01:34:39.280" style="s2">you know creating a set of psycho</p>

<p begin="01:34:39.280" end="01:34:44.480" style="s2">for each proto-b uh is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.320" end="01:34:46.080" style="s2">curatorial function and it probably</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.480" end="01:34:46.960" style="s2">varies by the people that are in the</p>

<p begin="01:34:46.960" end="01:34:51.040" style="s2">so anyway i am feeling the strong urge</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.920" end="01:34:53.119" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.040" end="01:34:56.000" style="s2">help catalyze other people to create a</p>

<p begin="01:34:56.000" end="01:34:59.040" style="s2">be the driving force behind one of them</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.560" end="01:35:00.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.040" end="01:35:02.719" style="s2">i&#39;m a feared that time is short and if</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.880" end="01:35:04.080" style="s2">we don&#39;t if we can&#39;t at least begin to</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.719" end="01:35:06.080" style="s2">experiment with</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.080" end="01:35:08.000" style="s2">real communities on the ground which</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.080" end="01:35:09.119" style="s2">were designed from day one to live</p>

<p begin="01:35:09.119" end="01:35:12.159" style="s2">environmental limits uh or at least</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.040" end="01:35:14.239" style="s2">close then one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.159" end="01:35:15.280" style="s2">like we do talk about in the proto-b</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.239" end="01:35:18.239" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.280" end="01:35:20.239" style="s2">is that the first proto-b&#39;s will not</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.239" end="01:35:21.199" style="s2">actually be living within their limits</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.239" end="01:35:22.639" style="s2">right that we</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.199" end="01:35:24.159" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to make our own computer</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.639" end="01:35:25.679" style="s2">chips for instance and there ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.159" end="01:35:27.360" style="s2">nothing we can do about intel</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.679" end="01:35:29.040" style="s2">and what bad things they do to create</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.360" end="01:35:30.400" style="s2">computer chips and</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.040" end="01:35:33.280" style="s2">there&#39;ll be plenty of other examples</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.400" end="01:35:35.280" style="s2">like that but we can be aware of the gap</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.280" end="01:35:38.080" style="s2">between true regenerative and</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.280" end="01:35:40.080" style="s2">sustainable living on a proto-b</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.080" end="01:35:41.600" style="s2">at any given point in time and the goal</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.080" end="01:35:42.719" style="s2">of getting to the point where it really</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.600" end="01:35:44.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.719" end="01:35:45.840" style="s2">sustainable and regenerative a</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.480" end="01:35:47.040" style="s2">regenerative part we can work</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.840" end="01:35:48.480" style="s2">and work hard i think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.040" end="01:35:49.199" style="s2">good knowledge i think i mentioned last</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.480" end="01:35:52.080" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.199" end="01:35:54.800" style="s2">on our farm my wife and i have we have</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.080" end="01:35:57.360" style="s2">built soil we have tripled the</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.800" end="01:35:58.960" style="s2">capacity to grow hay without using any</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.360" end="01:36:00.719" style="s2">artificial fertilizer we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.960" end="01:36:03.360" style="s2">sustainable logging</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.719" end="01:36:04.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve done major repair on the water</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.360" end="01:36:08.080" style="s2">courses the streams that run</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.880" end="01:36:09.840" style="s2">through our area we built ponds to you</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.080" end="01:36:10.639" style="s2">know keep water from running off too</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.840" end="01:36:12.719" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.639" end="01:36:14.239" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of things we know and a</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.719" end="01:36:14.960" style="s2">lot of people know more about this than</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.239" end="01:36:17.520" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.960" end="01:36:19.280" style="s2">in terms of regeneration of a local</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.520" end="01:36:20.000" style="s2">piece of soil and i think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.280" end="01:36:22.400" style="s2">got to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.000" end="01:36:23.119" style="s2">literally put to work but embedded in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.400" end="01:36:26.560" style="s2">matrix</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.119" end="01:36:27.520" style="s2">that can exist within game a and this is</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.560" end="01:36:29.920" style="s2">we call</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.520" end="01:36:32.480" style="s2">how do we design the proto-b so that it</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.920" end="01:36:34.480" style="s2">can parasitize game a right so</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.480" end="01:36:36.239" style="s2">in a game b community you have many</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.480" end="01:36:38.239" style="s2">people working the land and making</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.239" end="01:36:40.159" style="s2">furniture and making clothes</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.239" end="01:36:41.280" style="s2">even but probably you have other people</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.159" end="01:36:43.280" style="s2">doing uh</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.280" end="01:36:44.320" style="s2">you know management consulting and</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.280" end="01:36:46.800" style="s2">programming</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.320" end="01:36:47.840" style="s2">to pull some resources in to make the</p>

<p begin="01:36:47.840" end="01:36:52.159" style="s2">actually viable in the world so this is</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.840" end="01:36:54.320" style="s2">where my heart is at and i think if the</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.159" end="01:36:57.119" style="s2">pandemic hadn&#39;t occurred at least one</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.320" end="01:36:59.119" style="s2">proto-b would have been launched in 2020</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.119" end="01:37:01.280" style="s2">but i believe that the pandemic has</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.119" end="01:37:03.360" style="s2">pushed us out probably a year</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.280" end="01:37:04.800" style="s2">and so i&#39;ll be damned disappointed if by</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.360" end="01:37:06.960" style="s2">the end of 2021</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.800" end="01:37:09.040" style="s2">at least one or two proto-b&#39;s haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.960" end="01:37:09.840" style="s2">actually started to emerge upon the face</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.040" end="01:37:12.159" style="s2">of the earth</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.840" end="01:37:13.920" style="s2">this sounds wonderful and it makes me</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.159" end="01:37:16.239" style="s2">feel good because of my past with</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.920" end="01:37:17.600" style="s2">um having hung out and worked with and</p>

<p begin="01:37:17.600" end="01:37:22.000" style="s2">so many of the um communities in the</p>

<p begin="01:37:22.000" end="01:37:25.679" style="s2">the days are sort of reinventing the</p>

<p begin="01:37:32.639" end="01:37:36.480" style="s2">you set out to create these proto-b&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.719" end="01:37:38.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of learning</p>

<p begin="01:38:11.440" end="01:38:14.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.760" end="01:38:16.080" style="s2">proto-b&#39;s i think it&#39;s important to to</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.480" end="01:38:16.880" style="s2">pick up the learnings that that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.080" end="01:38:19.040" style="s2">already made</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.880" end="01:38:20.639" style="s2">and also i think another conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.040" end="01:38:22.320" style="s2">thing that there&#39;s a is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.639" end="01:38:22.880" style="s2">lesson from the eco village movement is</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.320" end="01:38:26.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.880" end="01:38:27.840" style="s2">what happens naturally as you create a</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.239" end="01:38:30.000" style="s2">sort of in bucky fuller&#39;s terms let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.840" end="01:38:32.000" style="s2">build a new system that makes the old</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.000" end="01:38:35.040" style="s2">system obsolete if you do that at the</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.000" end="01:38:37.360" style="s2">community scale in a real physical place</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.040" end="01:38:38.480" style="s2">the amount of work it takes to do that</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.360" end="01:38:40.719" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.480" end="01:38:42.000" style="s2">focuses in tension of everybody engaged</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.719" end="01:38:44.560" style="s2">in that pro project</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.000" end="01:38:46.239" style="s2">relatively inwardly to build up the</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.560" end="01:38:48.239" style="s2">basic infrastructure to create</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.239" end="01:38:49.840" style="s2">the like make sure that it&#39;s zero impact</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.239" end="01:38:50.880" style="s2">and that it has all the renewables this</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.840" end="01:38:52.560" style="s2">that and the other and the green</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.880" end="01:38:55.600" style="s2">building and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.560" end="01:38:57.440" style="s2">and in that process it&#39;s very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.600" end="01:38:59.440" style="s2">building a bubble that isn&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.440" end="01:39:00.000" style="s2">grounded in the nested system that it</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.440" end="01:39:02.960" style="s2">sits in</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.000" end="01:39:05.360" style="s2">and it like just not out of spite not</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.960" end="01:39:07.840" style="s2">enough because people don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.360" end="01:39:08.800" style="s2">talk to the local rednecks that live</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.840" end="01:39:10.560" style="s2">next door</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.800" end="01:39:12.000" style="s2">but because they just don&#39;t have time</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.560" end="01:39:14.880" style="s2">and the the key bit</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.000" end="01:39:16.719" style="s2">is if you if these proto-b&#39;s are going</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.880" end="01:39:18.000" style="s2">to be successful you have to from the</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.719" end="01:39:20.400" style="s2">beginning think of them</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.000" end="01:39:22.320" style="s2">in a scale-linking design way and say</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.400" end="01:39:24.480" style="s2">how do we make this proto-b</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.320" end="01:39:26.000" style="s2">interact with the wider bioregional</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.480" end="01:39:27.840" style="s2">context it sits in</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.000" end="01:39:30.239" style="s2">and how do we make it into the the</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.840" end="01:39:33.440" style="s2">yogurt culture that turns the milk</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.239" end="01:39:33.840" style="s2">of the region into yogurt um if if you</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.440" end="01:39:35.760" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.840" end="01:39:38.080" style="s2">have that process from the beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.760" end="01:39:41.040" style="s2">my mind they&#39;re just going to be</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.080" end="01:39:44.080" style="s2">a recreating of the ecovillage</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.040" end="01:39:46.320" style="s2">experiments of the 1960s and 70s and</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.080" end="01:39:47.520" style="s2">80s and so on yeah i think you&#39;re 100</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.320" end="01:39:51.040" style="s2">right unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.520" end="01:39:53.360" style="s2">uh the game b code we call deep code</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.040" end="01:39:54.960" style="s2">includes all those things right it has</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.360" end="01:39:57.600" style="s2">to be scalable over time</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.960" end="01:39:58.560" style="s2">through copying and what we call x in a</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.600" end="01:40:00.960" style="s2">box where we share</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.560" end="01:40:03.199" style="s2">our techniques we strongly believe that</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.960" end="01:40:04.400" style="s2">as we i said earlier proto-b&#39;s can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.199" end="01:40:06.159" style="s2">self-sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.400" end="01:40:07.920" style="s2">and they have to be thoughtful about how</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.159" end="01:40:09.040" style="s2">they engage the world and i&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.920" end="01:40:11.920" style="s2">wrote my paper on</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.040" end="01:40:13.600" style="s2">proto-b&#39;s called a journey to game b at</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.920" end="01:40:15.360" style="s2">the more mundane level as you said the</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.600" end="01:40:16.159" style="s2">proto-b&#39;s should participate in the</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.360" end="01:40:18.719" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.159" end="01:40:20.000" style="s2">uh football league right they should</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.719" end="01:40:22.400" style="s2">become members of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.000" end="01:40:23.840" style="s2">local volunteer fire department you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.400" end="01:40:26.639" style="s2">they should be</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.840" end="01:40:27.840" style="s2">and should even engage in local politics</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.639" end="01:40:30.400" style="s2">you know currently game b</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.840" end="01:40:31.840" style="s2">is choose national politics as this</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.400" end="01:40:34.000" style="s2">complete show</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.840" end="01:40:36.080" style="s2">but uh we believe that that we should be</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.000" end="01:40:37.920" style="s2">active involved in local politics</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.080" end="01:40:39.520" style="s2">and so i think we definitely want to</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.920" end="01:40:41.440" style="s2">avoid the uh</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.520" end="01:40:42.880" style="s2">you know the fallacies of the past and</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.440" end="01:40:43.600" style="s2">fortunately people helped know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.880" end="01:40:45.520" style="s2">more about</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.600" end="01:40:46.880" style="s2">those previous experiences than i do in</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.520" end="01:40:49.520" style="s2">the game b world and</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.880" end="01:40:51.360" style="s2">are bringing their perspectives to bear</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.520" end="01:40:53.040" style="s2">but i think your sense is exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.360" end="01:40:55.679" style="s2">that it can easily</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.040" end="01:40:58.000" style="s2">become too hobbyist essentially in</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.679" end="01:40:59.560" style="s2">trying to micro-optimize</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.000" end="01:41:01.360" style="s2">something which is not ready for</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.560" end="01:41:04.080" style="s2">micro-optimization yet</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.360" end="01:41:06.000" style="s2">and that we have to be understand that</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.080" end="01:41:06.480" style="s2">we&#39;re a teeny little piece in a much</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.000" end="01:41:08.639" style="s2">bigger</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.480" end="01:41:10.159" style="s2">system even though it is our long-term</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.639" end="01:41:11.760" style="s2">goal to convert the system</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.159" end="01:41:13.360" style="s2">to the new cause but that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.760" end="01:41:16.239" style="s2">happen overnight so i think</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.360" end="01:41:17.360" style="s2">all very good thoughts and i hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.239" end="01:41:19.360" style="s2">will inform</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.360" end="01:41:20.960" style="s2">the formations of uh the various</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.360" end="01:41:21.840" style="s2">proto-b&#39;s which i hope will come in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.960" end="01:41:24.800" style="s2">world over the next</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.840" end="01:41:26.480" style="s2">few years have you um had a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.800" end="01:41:28.719" style="s2">with pedro tarak yet</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.480" end="01:41:30.560" style="s2">uh no don&#39;t know that name pedro tarak</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.719" end="01:41:32.320" style="s2">is a lawyer from argentina who is a</p>

<p begin="01:41:37.760" end="01:41:40.880" style="s2">is very keen to point out that he</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.280" end="01:41:42.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have nothing himself he always</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.880" end="01:41:43.600" style="s2">works with in collaboration and in</p>

<p begin="01:42:01.199" end="01:42:06.159" style="s2">um so and it&#39;s basically about systems</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.000" end="01:42:08.480" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.159" end="01:42:09.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s exploring that in in in</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.480" end="01:42:12.639" style="s2">different areas</p>

<p begin="01:42:55.360" end="01:42:57.600" style="s2">something happening there&#39;s a trend we</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.040" end="01:43:00.880" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.600" end="01:43:02.239" style="s2">create a latin american network of these</p>

<p begin="01:43:21.600" end="01:43:24.000" style="s2">pedro and his friends basically said we</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.280" end="01:43:26.159" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.000" end="01:43:28.480" style="s2">include that but in a wider context</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.159" end="01:43:29.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just about business</p>
