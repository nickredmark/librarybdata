<p begin="00:00:01.100" end="00:00:08.400" style="s2">so this morning I woke up and had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">feeling we needed to change the question</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.400" end="00:00:14.929" style="s2">but the idea cafe was going to Center on</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.630" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">that is the point of an idea Cafe is</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.929" end="00:00:19.890" style="s2">having a meaningful conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:21.689" style="s2">a question and the question I had put</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.890" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">out there into the world for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.689" end="00:00:28.980" style="s2">inaugural cafe was about which teacher</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">or mentor has had an impact on your life</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">and this morning when I woke up it be</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:35.399" style="s2">nine eleven it didn&#39;t feel right to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">that conversation not when it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.399" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">first cafe but I wanted to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">that it was okay to change the question</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:44.190" style="s2">so I asked the people who had agreed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:45.809" style="s2">participate and with the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.190" end="00:00:47.430" style="s2">if anyone wasn&#39;t ok with it we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.809" end="00:00:50.250" style="s2">gonna change the question but I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.430" end="00:00:52.140" style="s2">to honor the day and someone had said</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.250" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">yeah actually I&#39;m not okay talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.140" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">it but then she had also said that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:58.469" style="s2">actually not okay talking at all today</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">because of that so the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.469" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">changed the question and talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2">where we were 18 years ago and so these</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">were people someone in my life who I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.990" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">weird that would be and this woman have</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">this connection that we were both</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">traveling abroad but she didn&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:54.330" style="s2">the language and I did speak the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:55.380" style="s2">language and yet out of all the people</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.330" end="00:02:56.730" style="s2">in the world that could have joined</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.380" end="00:02:59.820" style="s2">there was somebody who wasn&#39;t even just</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.730" end="00:03:03.500" style="s2">in America or just had an inconvenience</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.820" end="00:03:07.710" style="s2">on that day it was like right there in</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.500" end="00:03:09.210" style="s2">the space that like you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.710" end="00:03:11.640" style="s2">what&#39;s going on we all didn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.210" end="00:03:14.570" style="s2">was going on but like right there not</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.640" end="00:03:16.860" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s going on and how these</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.570" end="00:03:19.950" style="s2">moments in history</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.860" end="00:03:22.320" style="s2">bring us together and eighteen years</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.950" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">later we can share those stories but</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.320" end="00:03:27.060" style="s2">what I want to be able to do is as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:30.420" style="s2">are in history and it&#39;s unfolding and be</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.060" end="00:03:32.550" style="s2">able to share stories there is and was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.420" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">concern about us elevating our voices</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.550" end="00:03:36.330" style="s2">above the people who actually were there</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">and experiencing it and then someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.330" end="00:03:42.030" style="s2">who&#39;s actually there and experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">showed up but I do think I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.030" end="00:03:46.800" style="s2">elevate our voices I think everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:48.600" style="s2">story is important and everyone&#39;s voice</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.800" end="00:03:51.690" style="s2">is important no matter what the topic is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.600" end="00:03:53.550" style="s2">and in normal social media where we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.690" end="00:03:55.890" style="s2">elevating people and listening to them</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.550" end="00:03:57.600" style="s2">on a platform it&#39;s very different than</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.890" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">just being part of a conversation part</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.600" end="00:04:01.350" style="s2">of a conversation I want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:03.660" style="s2">everyone&#39;s ideas and everyone&#39;s voices</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.350" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">and then who we choose to elevate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.660" end="00:04:09.030" style="s2">repeatedly listen to should be people</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">who have a bigger ownership of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.030" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">experience in this case miss optimism on</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:19.640" style="s2">today&#39;s idea cafe I would say would take</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:19.640" style="s2">that one for sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.720" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">but the power the power of coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.430" end="00:04:25.370" style="s2">together and sharing our stories showing</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.870" end="00:04:27.169" style="s2">our shared humanity showing that these</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.370" end="00:04:28.819" style="s2">moments connect us that our emotions</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.169" end="00:04:31.009" style="s2">connect us that we&#39;re all human and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.819" end="00:04:33.949" style="s2">all have something to give is what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.009" end="00:04:36.949" style="s2">idea Cafe is and it&#39;s going to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.949" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">into its own platform that is designed</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.949" end="00:04:41.180" style="s2">for that so anyone no matter what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">experience whether it&#39;s a global</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.180" end="00:04:43.819" style="s2">experience whether it&#39;s a local</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:45.110" style="s2">experience whether it&#39;s a personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.819" end="00:04:46.280" style="s2">experience whether you&#39;re like going</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.110" end="00:04:48.919" style="s2">through a divorce you need people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.280" end="00:04:51.199" style="s2">talk to you about that or you have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.919" end="00:04:53.539" style="s2">heartbreak or you you know your your</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.199" end="00:04:55.940" style="s2">cities having an election or there&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.539" end="00:04:58.669" style="s2">weather that that day whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.940" end="00:05:00.949" style="s2">that that your group wants to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.669" end="00:05:02.449" style="s2">you can talk about that and putting you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.949" end="00:05:05.449" style="s2">together with groups to focus on those</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.449" end="00:05:08.150" style="s2">questions so I think today was an</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.449" end="00:05:11.419" style="s2">amazing idea cafe and now we have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">brainstorm a question to go for a week -</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.419" end="00:05:18.830" style="s2">because I can&#39;t follow that up with one</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:20.539" style="s2">that isn&#39;t empowering and enjoyable to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.830" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">talk about because that is also the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.539" end="00:05:22.669" style="s2">point the point is to have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:24.159" style="s2">conversation with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.669" end="00:05:26.270" style="s2">enjoying being part of that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.159" end="00:05:27.740" style="s2">not a conversation it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.270" end="00:05:30.289" style="s2">something to be palatable to the masses</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.740" end="00:05:31.310" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a weird medium because</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.289" end="00:05:34.940" style="s2">we&#39;re having like an intimate</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.310" end="00:05:38.810" style="s2">conversation on a very public platform</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.940" end="00:05:42.349" style="s2">and owning the awkward weirdness of that</p>
