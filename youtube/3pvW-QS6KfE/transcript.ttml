<p begin="00:01:12.420" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">podcast I&#39;m calling it Dugan for dummies</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.549" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s Alexander Dugan the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:20.429" style="s2">philosopher to be honest I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:23.490" style="s2">know too terribly much about Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.429" end="00:01:26.249" style="s2">Dugan or his relationship with Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.490" end="00:01:29.039" style="s2">and so I am interested to learn a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.249" end="00:01:30.539" style="s2">more about that and I&#39;m so excited to</p>

<p begin="00:01:38.399" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">bit with a little bit of your background</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.109" end="00:01:45.359" style="s2">story you have an experience that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">similar to a lot of other folks these</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.359" end="00:01:50.459" style="s2">days people to folks who are people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">are out sort of on the edge willing to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.459" end="00:01:54.509" style="s2">engage with ideas that they may not</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">agree with willing to engage with ideas</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.509" end="00:01:59.819" style="s2">that people may find radical or</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">off-the-wall and so you&#39;ve experienced a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.819" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">little bit of canceled culture yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">why don&#39;t you tell us a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">that I think the story starts about</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:08.910" style="s2">while you&#39;re trying to get your PhD is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">that right yeah it goes back a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.910" end="00:02:12.750" style="s2">bit earlier so let me just set it up I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:15.209" style="s2">was an undergraduate in philosophy at</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:17.819" style="s2">the University of British Columbia and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.209" end="00:02:19.950" style="s2">was studying basically Plato Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.819" end="00:02:23.069" style="s2">some of the main texts you study when</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.950" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">you do a program in philosophy and at</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.069" end="00:02:27.540" style="s2">some point I got the interest in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:28.940" style="s2">learning technical philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.540" end="00:02:31.010" style="s2">vocabulary in Russian</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.940" end="00:02:32.780" style="s2">and the reason I got that interest is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.010" end="00:02:33.140" style="s2">that my family&#39;s from the former Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.780" end="00:02:35.330" style="s2">Union</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.140" end="00:02:39.230" style="s2">we spoke some Russian in the household</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.330" end="00:02:41.420" style="s2">growing up and I had been even vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.230" end="00:02:44.510" style="s2">aware of some tradition of Russian</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.420" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">mysticism and sort of these Russian</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.510" end="00:02:49.430" style="s2">religious thinkers in the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">like Vladimir Solovyov for example is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.430" end="00:02:54.440" style="s2">one of them and I developed this</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:56.690" style="s2">interest in knowing for example how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.440" end="00:02:59.390" style="s2">say the key terms of a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.690" end="00:03:01.130" style="s2">lexicon in Russian so in English you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.390" end="00:03:04.250" style="s2">know there&#39;s like I mean you may or may</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.130" end="00:03:06.860" style="s2">not know there&#39;s a substance accident</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.250" end="00:03:08.660" style="s2">essence existence all that - all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.860" end="00:03:11.690" style="s2">terms that have been passed down from</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.660" end="00:03:13.430" style="s2">Greek to Latin and eventually to English</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.690" end="00:03:16.310" style="s2">I wanted to know them in Russian so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.430" end="00:03:18.500" style="s2">proposed to do a translation of some</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.310" end="00:03:20.360" style="s2">Russian philosopher in my department and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.500" end="00:03:23.270" style="s2">I got the green light to do that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.360" end="00:03:24.680" style="s2">said just find a contemporary russian</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.270" end="00:03:26.990" style="s2">philosopher and an older russian</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.680" end="00:03:29.570" style="s2">philosopher and you can do that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.990" end="00:03:31.070" style="s2">work with you to translate them and see</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.570" end="00:03:32.780" style="s2">what comes out of it so at this time I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.070" end="00:03:35.660" style="s2">did not know who Alexander Dugan was</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.780" end="00:03:37.190" style="s2">yeah it was my task to go try to find a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.660" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">contemporary philosopher because this</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.190" end="00:03:41.720" style="s2">guy had an interest in didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:44.270" style="s2">count you know 1900 is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.720" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">before our time that&#39;s when some of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.270" end="00:03:53.239" style="s2">have died so at the same time I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">reading a journal called Azur a zu re</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.239" end="00:03:58.940" style="s2">okay and I encountered an article there</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:01.160" style="s2">called Alexander do get Dugan profit of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.940" end="00:04:03.730" style="s2">a new Russian Empire something like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.160" end="00:04:06.680" style="s2">okay and this article was just gripping</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.730" end="00:04:09.140" style="s2">really gripping because it said that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.680" end="00:04:11.630" style="s2">Dugan was this sort of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.140" end="00:04:13.310" style="s2">philosopher king who you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.630" end="00:04:16.419" style="s2">understand Russia if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.310" end="00:04:20.330" style="s2">understand its deepest identity its</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.419" end="00:04:23.000" style="s2">spiritual soul and that Dugan was really</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.330" end="00:04:27.080" style="s2">your window into that deep understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.000" end="00:04:29.060" style="s2">of Russia so the article had touched a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.080" end="00:04:31.550" style="s2">few things that are just personally</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.060" end="00:04:33.290" style="s2">deeply very interesting to me but again</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.550" end="00:04:35.180" style="s2">the figure of the philosopher King which</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.290" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">comes from Plato&#39;s Republic and is just</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.180" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">you know as I was studying in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:40.039" style="s2">department that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:42.139" style="s2">that stood out for me the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.039" end="00:04:43.939" style="s2">have the wise should be the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.139" end="00:04:46.159" style="s2">legislators you know or the wise should</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.939" end="00:04:48.439" style="s2">be the ones who configure political life</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.159" end="00:04:51.620" style="s2">so all of that came out in this article</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.439" end="00:04:54.259" style="s2">another thing that was really as I say</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.620" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">gripping was there was a story that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.259" end="00:04:58.219" style="s2">had been kicked out of Ukraine I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">because he has some thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.219" end="00:05:01.550" style="s2">Ukrainian geopolitics that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:04.460" style="s2">necessarily square with their own self</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.550" end="00:05:07.129" style="s2">understanding and that the same day that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.460" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">he was kicked out of Ukraine the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.129" end="00:05:10.879" style="s2">government expelled Ukrainian ambassador</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:13.849" style="s2">and his family from Russia so there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.879" end="00:05:16.310" style="s2">to see like that a state has the back of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.849" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">this weird mystical philosopher who</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.310" end="00:05:20.180" style="s2">somehow has penetrated the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:22.069" style="s2">Russian soil all of that was just that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.180" end="00:05:25.310" style="s2">was just interesting okay yeah definite</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.069" end="00:05:28.009" style="s2">them up and I found a speech of his this</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.310" end="00:05:29.479" style="s2">must have been 2010 or 11 I couldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.009" end="00:05:31.610" style="s2">exactly something around that time I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.479" end="00:05:33.189" style="s2">looked them up and I found a speech</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.610" end="00:05:35.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a five-minute talk on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.189" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">about something he called the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.599" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">political theory right something he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:41.389" style="s2">known for now because a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:43.849" style="s2">fourth political theory was published in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.389" end="00:05:45.349" style="s2">2012 and I helped to translate it which</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.849" end="00:05:47.900" style="s2">got the ball rolling for all of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.349" end="00:05:49.879" style="s2">all of the canceled culture blow back</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.900" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">but at the time it was just an</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.879" end="00:05:54.710" style="s2">interesting lecture I heard you know so</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:05:56.930" style="s2">that I basically went on his Russian</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.710" end="00:05:58.669" style="s2">Wikipedia saw he had a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.930" end="00:06:00.289" style="s2">fourth political theory ran it by my</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.669" end="00:06:01.819" style="s2">supervisor and said why don&#39;t we start</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.289" end="00:06:02.899" style="s2">here you know this scene this is all I</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.819" end="00:06:04.849" style="s2">know about the guy it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.899" end="00:06:06.710" style="s2">fascinating that five minute lecture</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.849" end="00:06:09.139" style="s2">also pulled me in for reasons I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.710" end="00:06:12.399" style="s2">explain and he said sure let&#39;s do it I</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.740" end="00:09:10.770" style="s2">traditionalist they had never heard any</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.600" end="00:09:12.870" style="s2">of that presented just on like for what</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.770" end="00:09:15.240" style="s2">it is like to try to understand it to</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.149" end="00:09:21.690" style="s2">know you look at whether it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.550" end="00:09:22.500" style="s2">you look at Russia or you look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.690" end="00:09:24.450" style="s2">conservatives you look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.500" end="00:09:28.140" style="s2">traditionalists and all you do is say</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.450" end="00:09:30.270" style="s2">we&#39;re fascists neo-fascist Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.140" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">you know this logic right anything that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.270" end="00:09:34.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fall into the status quo is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:38.490" style="s2">somehow outside of it is automatically</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.140" end="00:09:39.750" style="s2">branded and that&#39;s funnily enough what</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.490" end="00:09:42.300" style="s2">happened when I came back to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.750" end="00:09:43.950" style="s2">University after the TV interview so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.300" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">gave the interview people around the</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:47.790" style="s2">it was one of their big fit while</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.709" end="00:09:49.380" style="s2">blowing up it&#39;s almost at a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.790" end="00:09:53.070" style="s2">thousand views which for that particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.380" end="00:09:54.570" style="s2">station it&#39;s not so bad and then before</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.070" end="00:09:56.339" style="s2">too long I got hauled into the offices</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.570" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">of my dissertation supervisor at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.339" end="00:10:00.029" style="s2">University of Toronto and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:01.290" style="s2">railroading began all right before we</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.029" end="00:10:03.029" style="s2">before we get too much further with that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.290" end="00:10:05.220" style="s2">can turn the gain down on your vault on</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.029" end="00:10:07.320" style="s2">your microphone just a smidge and can</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.220" end="00:10:08.790" style="s2">you explain why it is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.320" end="00:10:10.589" style="s2">important that you have like a committee</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.790" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">like your PhD committee I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.589" end="00:10:14.070" style="s2">everybody understands yeah is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:16.890" style="s2">better yeah it&#39;s better okay sorry</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.070" end="00:10:19.589" style="s2">no problem past so in a in a graduate</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.890" end="00:10:22.380" style="s2">program what you do is you spend three</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.589" end="00:10:24.750" style="s2">or four some people spend more but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.380" end="00:10:27.720" style="s2">say three to four years on a major</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.750" end="00:10:30.360" style="s2">research project and usually the way it</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:32.100" style="s2">works is you have one supervisor who</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.360" end="00:10:34.740" style="s2">works with you on that project they</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.100" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">basically take you under their wing you</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.740" end="00:10:39.720" style="s2">share your your chapters with them and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:41.910" style="s2">they give you critical feedback</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.720" end="00:10:44.370" style="s2">your closest point of contact but in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.910" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">order down the road to defend that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.370" end="00:10:48.779" style="s2">dissertation which you have to do to</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:50.519" style="s2">graduate from the program you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.779" end="00:10:52.949" style="s2">it before a committee of members and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.519" end="00:10:55.050" style="s2">those members sign an agreement with you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.949" end="00:10:56.730" style="s2">at the proposal stage so first you</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.050" end="00:10:59.339" style="s2">propose the project you want to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.730" end="00:11:00.990" style="s2">like a 20 page proposal for example they</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.339" end="00:11:02.430" style="s2">say I&#39;ll sign off they say this is going</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.990" end="00:11:04.740" style="s2">to be a contribution to the literature</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.430" end="00:11:07.379" style="s2">this is methodologically sound it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.740" end="00:11:10.220" style="s2">interesting and yeah you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.379" end="00:11:12.660" style="s2">we&#39;re here to have you defend this and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.220" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">then off you go you do the research and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.660" end="00:11:15.870" style="s2">hopefully at the end of three years you</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:18.060" style="s2">have something that you can defend in</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.870" end="00:11:20.610" style="s2">order to graduate so I was in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.060" end="00:11:23.459" style="s2">process but I was very early in it I</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.610" end="00:11:24.930" style="s2">just had the proposal accepted so I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.459" end="00:11:26.939" style="s2">the committee people who had agreed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.930" end="00:11:28.290" style="s2">work with me they knew I was into Dugan</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.939" end="00:11:29.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.290" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">well I hadn&#39;t been talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.550" end="00:11:31.800" style="s2">since I got there but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:34.259" style="s2">mentioned it because I was proud of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.800" end="00:11:36.509" style="s2">mm-hmm I was getting good grades so</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.259" end="00:11:39.449" style="s2">there&#39;s no issue there about all of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.509" end="00:11:41.910" style="s2">technicalities were in order right my</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.449" end="00:11:44.279" style="s2">teaching reviews were good as a TA so</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.910" end="00:11:46.319" style="s2">everything&#39;s University of Toronto right</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.279" end="00:11:48.540" style="s2">yeah so for those of you who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.319" end="00:11:50.939" style="s2">and it&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.540" end="00:11:53.699" style="s2">University of Toronto is it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.939" end="00:11:55.110" style="s2">and for a few reasons actually because</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.110" end="00:11:58.259" style="s2">school in Canada so you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.699" end="00:12:01.500" style="s2">this to be the place where you have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.259" end="00:12:03.329" style="s2">most serious examination especially in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.500" end="00:12:06.120" style="s2">department of okay I was in a department</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.329" end="00:12:07.500" style="s2">of political science by now and the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.120" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">political science works is there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.500" end="00:12:11.069" style="s2">subfields so somebody works on</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.779" end="00:12:18.870" style="s2">science is called political theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.100" end="00:12:20.730" style="s2">that&#39;s where the philosophy happens</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.870" end="00:12:26.040" style="s2">that&#39;s where you do the careful readings</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.730" end="00:12:30.660" style="s2">of theoretical texts of classics and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:33.209" style="s2">of that and so the fact that my work was</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.660" end="00:12:36.059" style="s2">so badly received not because of its</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.209" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">quality but but because of the logic of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.059" end="00:12:41.759" style="s2">cancel&#39; culture here in a way right</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:43.379" style="s2">somehow I touched a nerve and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.759" end="00:12:45.029" style="s2">supposed to happen because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.379" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">Department of Political Science at the</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.630" end="00:12:53.580" style="s2">is the last place in principle you would</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.509" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">expect or where I expected</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.580" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">to have the kind of reaction that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:13:00.660" style="s2">that TV interview eventually got right</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:03.060" style="s2">so what year was this that you were</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.660" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">putting your committee together so they</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.060" end="00:13:06.720" style="s2">had signed off it was either late 2014</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:08.100" style="s2">or early 2015</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.720" end="00:13:10.440" style="s2">so pretty much rate at the time that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.100" end="00:13:12.750" style="s2">gave the interview I had already had the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.440" end="00:13:14.339" style="s2">project accepted I already had a chapter</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.750" end="00:13:16.529" style="s2">that got a pretty good review from my</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.339" end="00:13:18.690" style="s2">supervisor in fact that said it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.529" end="00:13:20.970" style="s2">quite good really good and I had a whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.690" end="00:13:22.350" style="s2">committee so I was sailing actually I</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.970" end="00:13:24.390" style="s2">felt when I thought that I was sailing</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:26.700" style="s2">and for context isn&#39;t University of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.390" end="00:13:27.060" style="s2">Toronto where Jordan Peterson was yes it</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.700" end="00:13:29.820" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.060" end="00:13:31.560" style="s2">yes it is but that his his sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.820" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">Fiasco came a little bit later a couple</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.560" end="00:13:36.990" style="s2">years later now yeah it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:38.700" style="s2">some online conspiracy theorists who</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.990" end="00:13:40.529" style="s2">later learned that I was there and he</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.700" end="00:13:41.940" style="s2">was there we both work on Heidegger you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.529" end="00:13:43.500" style="s2">know they started to draw connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.940" end="00:13:45.450" style="s2">that he&#39;s secretly a du Guinness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.500" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">things like that but you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.450" end="00:13:50.790" style="s2">count on the conspiracy theorist to draw</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:52.440" style="s2">connections at will right right okay so</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.790" end="00:13:54.089" style="s2">they everybody starts to find out what</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.440" end="00:13:56.190" style="s2">you&#39;re doing everything seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.089" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">gonna be moving ahead full steam and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.190" end="00:14:00.089" style="s2">then what happens yeah so I got an email</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:01.620" style="s2">that said from my supervisors I said hey</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.440" end="00:14:14.700" style="s2">tell you in retrospect it is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.779" end="00:14:16.890" style="s2">but at the time I thought this is great</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.700" end="00:14:19.170" style="s2">these guys are calling me in because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.890" end="00:14:20.459" style="s2">just sent them my chapter which they you</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.459" end="00:14:24.630" style="s2">great so I said look I&#39;m ahead of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.230" end="00:14:26.130" style="s2">curve things are going well for sure</p>

<p begin="00:14:28.020" end="00:14:32.520" style="s2">finishing in four years instead of five</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.300" end="00:14:34.620" style="s2">and about planning out my next</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.520" end="00:14:36.779" style="s2">professional steps like I was sure that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.620" end="00:14:38.430" style="s2">this was all gravy</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.779" end="00:14:43.500" style="s2">you know I did not see the bus coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.430" end="00:14:45.870" style="s2">okay so I went into his office and very</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.500" end="00:14:47.790" style="s2">somber Lou you know closes the door sits</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.870" end="00:14:51.990" style="s2">down Michael</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.790" end="00:14:54.269" style="s2">I saw your video on that TV program and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.990" end="00:14:56.670" style="s2">I have something I&#39;d like to say to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.269" end="00:14:58.350" style="s2">it takes out a piece of paper says I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.670" end="00:14:59.820" style="s2">too emotional I can&#39;t even say this too</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.350" end="00:15:01.649" style="s2">I had to write it out as a letter and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.820" end="00:15:04.440" style="s2">I&#39;m now I&#39;m going to read it to you boy</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.649" end="00:15:06.000" style="s2">and he starts reading me this letter</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.440" end="00:15:07.770" style="s2">that he wrote to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.000" end="00:15:09.450" style="s2">with his witness that he now I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.770" end="00:15:11.940" style="s2">understand you know he called a witness</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.450" end="00:15:13.710" style="s2">or his ass is protected whereas I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.940" end="00:15:15.690" style="s2">given the chance to have anything like</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.710" end="00:15:17.450" style="s2">that for my own protection so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.690" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">so he starts reading me this letter and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.450" end="00:15:23.940" style="s2">you know it&#39;s when I first heard about</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:25.710" style="s2">Dugan I just thought it was this</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.940" end="00:15:28.830" style="s2">harmless thing but then I looked them up</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.710" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">and I see he&#39;s he and then it started</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.830" end="00:15:34.380" style="s2">are you a anti-semite you support this</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:36.300" style="s2">or you extermination astana know that he</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.380" end="00:15:38.520" style="s2">would want to do this to me and how can</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.300" end="00:15:40.590" style="s2">you do that and it&#39;s just every</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.520" end="00:15:42.090" style="s2">accusation Under the Sun up to and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.590" end="00:15:44.400" style="s2">including that I&#39;m being used by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.090" end="00:15:47.730" style="s2">Russians so this was a total total</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.400" end="00:15:50.190" style="s2">blindside and I the only thing I regret</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.730" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">is I wish I had said you know you&#39;ve hit</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.190" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">so many so many points that are just</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:56.040" style="s2">gonna give me cause to reflect here can</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:57.750" style="s2">I just just have a copy of the letter so</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:15:59.700" style="s2">I can take it home and you know go over</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.750" end="00:16:01.500" style="s2">it and do some soul-searching because</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.700" end="00:16:02.760" style="s2">that letter was a real work of art but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.500" end="00:16:05.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get a copy of the letter</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.760" end="00:16:07.500" style="s2">but he he poured out his soul to me out</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.070" end="00:16:08.670" style="s2">of concern and it was pretty shocking</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.500" end="00:16:12.900" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:15.450" style="s2">so the next day I think like he emailed</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.900" end="00:16:17.850" style="s2">me and he said again how can you be</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.450" end="00:16:21.330" style="s2">involved with this guy in any way and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.850" end="00:16:23.130" style="s2">responded that look here&#39;s the jeers my</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.330" end="00:16:24.660" style="s2">philosophical interest in the guy here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.130" end="00:16:26.850" style="s2">the truth of the justification like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.660" end="00:16:30.870" style="s2">pretty it&#39;s pretty straightforward from</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.850" end="00:16:33.570" style="s2">my perspective and and really quickly he</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.870" end="00:16:34.770" style="s2">he resigned from the committee and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.570" end="00:16:37.050" style="s2">another member resigned from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.770" end="00:16:41.550" style="s2">committee and I had the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.050" end="00:16:43.560" style="s2">what was going to be like a minimum a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.550" end="00:16:45.870" style="s2">six months to a year of like deep hell</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.560" end="00:16:47.700" style="s2">at the campus where I didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.870" end="00:16:49.260" style="s2">supporters except for one this one</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.700" end="00:16:51.300" style="s2">committee member who later became my</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.260" end="00:16:53.010" style="s2">supervisor she was like the bright light</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.300" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">she&#39;s stood by my side she was appalled</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.010" end="00:16:57.330" style="s2">that these guys would resign she thought</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">there was no justification no ground for</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.330" end="00:17:01.020" style="s2">it that they were betraying all of their</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:17:02.670" style="s2">principles and you got to understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.020" end="00:17:04.949" style="s2">there are a million nuances here like</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.670" end="00:17:07.079" style="s2">one of the members who resigned was the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.949" end="00:17:08.699" style="s2">Strauss Ian who in principle is open to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.079" end="00:17:11.400" style="s2">the study of serious political</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.890" end="00:17:18.170" style="s2">given a public speech in which he said</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.929" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">that in a liberal democracy like ours</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.170" end="00:17:22.170" style="s2">there&#39;s no need for any</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:24.209" style="s2">to censor themselves because there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.650" end="00:17:47.070" style="s2">certain extent projects like that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.030" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">I&#39;ll say in addition you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.070" end="00:17:52.170" style="s2">want to study Islamic fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.020" end="00:17:53.610" style="s2">political theory which exists okay you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.170" end="00:17:57.450" style="s2">could do that if you want to study</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.610" end="00:18:00.360" style="s2">pretty much any radical political theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.450" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">especially on the left or multicultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.360" end="00:18:03.870" style="s2">radicalism okay if it&#39;s Aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.420" style="s2">radicalism or something like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.870" end="00:18:09.080" style="s2">fine if it is uh you see what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.420" end="00:18:12.300" style="s2">all of that is fine but somehow a</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.080" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">Russian Orthodox conservative whiteness</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.300" end="00:18:16.140" style="s2">who&#39;s not a liberal and doesn&#39;t fit into</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.140" end="00:18:21.720" style="s2">somehow that just there was no way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:24.120" style="s2">making sense of it and they all lost</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.720" end="00:18:26.280" style="s2">they all lost their minds and it was it</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.120" end="00:18:28.470" style="s2">was a pretty wild ride so I we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.280" end="00:18:30.330" style="s2">obviously gonna get into the the meat of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.470" end="00:18:31.710" style="s2">it all but I want to just tie this into</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.330" end="00:18:34.050" style="s2">a conversation I just had with James</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.710" end="00:18:35.820" style="s2">Lindsay the other day who has been</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.050" end="00:18:37.410" style="s2">writing a lot about his new book is</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.820" end="00:18:39.300" style="s2">called cynical theories and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.410" end="00:18:42.390" style="s2">about how post-modernism went from an</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.300" end="00:18:45.090" style="s2">artist etic all the way into applied</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.390" end="00:18:47.820" style="s2">postmodern theory and then into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.090" end="00:18:51.630" style="s2">a reified god-like religious</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.820" end="00:18:54.060" style="s2">circumstance of philosophy and in there</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.630" end="00:18:57.180" style="s2">you know they basically they&#39;re arguing</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.060" end="00:18:58.680" style="s2">against the liberal liberal political</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.180" end="00:19:01.230" style="s2">economy liberal thinking liberal</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.680" end="00:19:03.090" style="s2">societies through these philosophies to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.230" end="00:19:06.630" style="s2">what extent do you think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.090" end="00:19:08.580" style="s2">an anti liberalism force train running</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.630" end="00:19:11.070" style="s2">through the University of Toronto even</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.580" end="00:19:14.370" style="s2">if it&#39;s hidden or obscured to what</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.070" end="00:19:16.740" style="s2">extent is actually anti-liberal well</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.370" end="00:19:20.790" style="s2">look here here&#39;s the here&#39;s the thing so</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.740" end="00:19:23.670" style="s2">if the postmodern left has an anti</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.790" end="00:19:26.790" style="s2">liberal animus and it has infiltrated</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.670" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">certain departments or just established</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.790" end="00:19:31.620" style="s2">certain departments and it&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:33.530" style="s2">taken over whole you know faculties or</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.620" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">even whole institutions</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.530" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">let&#39;s say all of that is accurate okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:39.230" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing usually you have it</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:41.210" style="s2">set up like you have the post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.230" end="00:19:43.550" style="s2">left attack on liberalism science</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.210" end="00:19:45.800" style="s2">rationality freedom rights in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.550" end="00:19:47.210" style="s2">tradition but what happened at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.800" end="00:19:49.130" style="s2">University of Toronto did not fall into</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.210" end="00:19:50.600" style="s2">that because the people who kicked me</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.130" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">off the committee I mean you know who</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.600" end="00:19:54.710" style="s2">resigned the committee and basically as</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">I say effective lack lists from academia</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.710" end="00:19:59.210" style="s2">they were not on the postmodern left and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:01.130" style="s2">neither am i so this takes the whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.210" end="00:20:03.020" style="s2">logic of a campus culture war and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.130" end="00:20:06.310" style="s2">expands it to something that&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.020" end="00:20:10.310" style="s2">familiar which is that you had basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.310" end="00:20:11.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like center-left Liberals okay and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.310" end="00:20:13.820" style="s2">Center liberals these some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.900" end="00:20:15.560" style="s2">who are on the committee and me doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.820" end="00:20:17.950" style="s2">research on somebody who criticizes</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.560" end="00:20:20.780" style="s2">liberalism but not not from the left</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.950" end="00:20:22.610" style="s2">okay so it&#39;ll be important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.780" end="00:20:24.410" style="s2">something about where Dugan falls on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.610" end="00:20:26.060" style="s2">spectrum of political theories to see</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.410" end="00:20:28.430" style="s2">this more clearly but basically you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.060" end="00:20:30.620" style="s2">could say this is a bit of a distortion</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.430" end="00:20:35.090" style="s2">but still helpful that this was liberals</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.620" end="00:20:37.580" style="s2">and on campus blacklisting the study of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.090" end="00:20:39.020" style="s2">right-wing anti liberalism so again</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.580" end="00:20:41.090" style="s2">usually the tension is between the left</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.020" end="00:20:43.400" style="s2">the post modernists and the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.090" end="00:20:46.100" style="s2">but here is between the Liberals and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.400" end="00:20:48.550" style="s2">right of liberal critics now you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.100" end="00:20:52.010" style="s2">get a lot of right of liberal critics</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.550" end="00:20:53.630" style="s2">seriously studied in academia and even</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.010" end="00:20:56.710" style="s2">though it&#39;s much easier for a student</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.630" end="00:21:00.230" style="s2">let&#39;s say to name like GJ Berra de Fuko</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.710" end="00:21:01.670" style="s2">Marx and many other thinkers if you said</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.230" end="00:21:03.890" style="s2">to them okay that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.670" end="00:21:05.750" style="s2">tradition of the postmodern left now can</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.890" end="00:21:07.310" style="s2">you name to me some serious thinkers who</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.750" end="00:21:09.470" style="s2">represent the right right wing</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.310" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">alternative to liberalism they probably</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.470" end="00:21:14.450" style="s2">will not be able to do that okay but at</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:17.900" style="s2">least we would have to say Misha</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.450" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">Heidegger Carl Schmitt Alexander Dugan</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.900" end="00:21:22.070" style="s2">and to a certain extent Leo Strauss so</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:24.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a smaller universe but it always</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.070" end="00:21:27.110" style="s2">seems to me how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.290" end="00:21:29.150" style="s2">understand what liberalism is and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.110" end="00:21:31.820" style="s2">the threats to liberalism are if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.150" end="00:21:33.170" style="s2">only always looking to the left and when</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.820" end="00:21:36.170" style="s2">we look to the right all we see is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.170" end="00:21:38.420" style="s2">fascism or Nazism well it&#39;s more nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.170" end="00:21:39.800" style="s2">than that because these figures on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.420" end="00:21:41.810" style="s2">right are not identical to one another</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.800" end="00:21:44.150" style="s2">and they often disagree with one another</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.810" end="00:21:46.130" style="s2">Strauss was very critical of Schmidt</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.150" end="00:21:46.940" style="s2">Schmidt and Heidegger are not the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.130" end="00:21:48.890" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.940" end="00:21:51.020" style="s2">is his own story so there was this</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.890" end="00:21:54.680" style="s2">undiscovered territory on the right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.020" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">I said I thought basically like Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.680" end="00:21:57.830" style="s2">when he had to propose his punishment he</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">said you guys should all give me like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.830" end="00:22:01.370" style="s2">penthouse suite and you know five</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:03.110" style="s2">thousand dollars a month reward for what</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.370" end="00:22:06.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve shown you obviously they chose a</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.110" end="00:22:08.030" style="s2">different way so I thought similarly you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.680" end="00:22:09.740" style="s2">know I said look you guys have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.030" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">completely missing the picture on</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.740" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">right-wing anti liberalism and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:15.710" style="s2">giving you not just access to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:18.440" style="s2">figures who belong to that tradition</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.710" end="00:22:21.350" style="s2">inherently like Nietzsche let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.440" end="00:22:22.910" style="s2">Alexander Dugan a completely unique</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.350" end="00:22:24.770" style="s2">phenomenon that will help you to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.910" end="00:22:27.470" style="s2">understand the possible spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.770" end="00:22:29.060" style="s2">political theory right and they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.470" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">see it that way you know it&#39;s funny I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.060" end="00:22:33.650" style="s2">the circles I run into people I talk to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:35.090" style="s2">I hear Heidegger in each a a Strauss I</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.650" end="00:22:37.610" style="s2">hear these names and the ideas thrown</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.090" end="00:22:39.770" style="s2">around all so much that it doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.610" end="00:22:41.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t even stop for a second to think</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.770" end="00:22:43.070" style="s2">that it&#39;s like a radical thing to think</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.450" end="00:22:44.870" style="s2">about or out of the box or something</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.070" end="00:22:46.670" style="s2">wild well let me just say on that point</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.870" end="00:22:48.590" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s one of the reasons I feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.670" end="00:22:51.410" style="s2">more at home outside of academia now</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.590" end="00:22:52.610" style="s2">because I spent so many years there okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.410" end="00:22:55.880" style="s2">well through my undergraduate the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.610" end="00:22:57.500" style="s2">masters the PhD that the the environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.880" end="00:22:59.810" style="s2">on one hand there&#39;s the serious study of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.500" end="00:23:01.780" style="s2">old texts and there is to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.810" end="00:23:05.210" style="s2">you know high standards of scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.780" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">but there&#39;s a much fresher and freer air</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.210" end="00:23:09.140" style="s2">outside of academia I have met people</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:11.210" style="s2">and I&#39;ve spoken to people this</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.140" end="00:23:14.060" style="s2">conversation that we&#39;re having now where</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.210" end="00:23:16.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not only more respectful it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.060" end="00:23:21.170" style="s2">truer to the thought it&#39;s true it to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.910" end="00:23:22.730" style="s2">text it it&#39;s not so dogmatically closed</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.170" end="00:23:25.340" style="s2">at the outset that it can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.730" end="00:23:26.900" style="s2">learn anything and and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.340" end="00:23:29.510" style="s2">expecting that at the University but</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.900" end="00:23:30.860" style="s2">unfortunately I found that other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.510" end="00:23:33.050" style="s2">find it in different ways for different</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.860" end="00:23:34.220" style="s2">reasons and I think this space that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.050" end="00:23:36.650" style="s2">were helping to create and that other</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.220" end="00:23:39.140" style="s2">people are involved in outside of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.650" end="00:23:41.180" style="s2">academia where ideas they don&#39;t have to</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:51.230" style="s2">altogether I think outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.220" end="00:23:52.790" style="s2">university is where that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.230" end="00:23:54.800" style="s2">where it&#39;s going to continue to happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.790" end="00:23:56.750" style="s2">and I can tell you that there were</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.800" end="00:23:58.730" style="s2">students who came to me after class when</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.750" end="00:24:00.020" style="s2">I was a TA and who just still email me</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.730" end="00:24:01.670" style="s2">now all the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.020" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">and they know that the university is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.670" end="00:24:05.930" style="s2">the place where they can genuinely think</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">that&#39;s a damn shame but it&#39;s also a fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.930" end="00:24:11.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s an opportunity for the people</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:12.890" style="s2">like yourself and and others as I say</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.060" end="00:24:15.680" style="s2">who are keeping the conversation alive</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.890" end="00:24:19.130" style="s2">in in print and through podcasts and by</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.680" end="00:24:21.650" style="s2">video and it&#39;s quite exciting and as I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.130" end="00:24:22.370" style="s2">say a big relief for me in a way finally</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.650" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">to have left</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.370" end="00:24:25.730" style="s2">I haven&#39;t burned my bridges with</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:28.280" style="s2">academia I still respect as I say some</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.730" end="00:24:31.670" style="s2">components of it but the purest thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.280" end="00:24:32.990" style="s2">is not happening there yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.670" end="00:24:36.800" style="s2">unfortunate but it is yet another</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.990" end="00:24:39.830" style="s2">example of how there&#39;s emerging networks</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.800" end="00:24:43.190" style="s2">of people and expertise and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.830" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">understanding and action in in almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.190" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">every realm that is superseding the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:49.310" style="s2">established institutions so whether it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.310" end="00:24:52.220" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on there or</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.850" end="00:25:03.110" style="s2">forming outside of the institutions are</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.740" end="00:25:04.850" style="s2">weird that where the real evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.110" end="00:25:06.440" style="s2">where the action is where the answers</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.850" end="00:25:09.470" style="s2">are where the solutions are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.440" end="00:25:11.690" style="s2">found and it&#39;s an exciting place to be I</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.470" end="00:25:14.270" style="s2">couldn&#39;t imagine being on campus right</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.690" end="00:25:16.130" style="s2">now they&#39;re not not in the least I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.270" end="00:25:19.040" style="s2">actually doing my own version of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.130" end="00:25:21.260" style="s2">backfilling my gaps in my education this</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.040" end="00:25:24.170" style="s2">conversation is one of them on to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.260" end="00:25:25.730" style="s2">honest I&#39;m trying to sort of learn the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.170" end="00:25:28.100" style="s2">things that I didn&#39;t learn along the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.730" end="00:25:30.500" style="s2">in school both my masters and bachelor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.100" end="00:25:33.080" style="s2">um but I wanted to ask a question about</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.500" end="00:25:35.260" style="s2">the context what why do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:38.090" style="s2">there was such push back to studying</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.260" end="00:25:43.490" style="s2">dougen do you was it related do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.090" end="00:25:46.190" style="s2">think to Trump and Trump&#39;s alleged you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.490" end="00:25:48.560" style="s2">know collusion with with Putin and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.190" end="00:25:51.620" style="s2">Russia and like some great fear that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.560" end="00:25:54.020" style="s2">there was going to be like a Russian</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.620" end="00:25:56.390" style="s2">takeover of Western Mach I mean it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.020" end="00:25:58.610" style="s2">dumb to say but it&#39;s a takeover of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.390" end="00:26:01.280" style="s2">Western democracy or some sort of new</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.610" end="00:26:03.410" style="s2">dirty alliance between the United States</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.280" end="00:26:04.850" style="s2">and Russia or something that Dugan had</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.410" end="00:26:06.710" style="s2">something to do with do you think it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.850" end="00:26:10.220" style="s2">related to Trump at all or did a precede</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.710" end="00:26:13.340" style="s2">Trump by just a smidge or is it related</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.220" end="00:26:15.410" style="s2">it is related it&#39;s related</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.340" end="00:26:17.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not the only factor but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.410" end="00:26:20.810" style="s2">definitely one of the factors so the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.890" end="00:26:23.140" style="s2">supervisor who will resign first the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.810" end="00:26:24.680" style="s2">next book that he wrote was called</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.140" end="00:26:26.810" style="s2">Dangerous Minds</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.680" end="00:26:30.020" style="s2">Nietzsche Heidegger and the return of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.810" end="00:26:31.460" style="s2">the far right so smack on the concern</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.020" end="00:26:34.970" style="s2">and it&#39;s the cover of the book is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.460" end="00:26:39.620" style="s2">Charlottesville okay so for him it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.970" end="00:26:42.110" style="s2">like immediately related Heidegger Dugan</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.620" end="00:26:45.380" style="s2">Nazis tiki torches it&#39;s all the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.110" end="00:26:47.390" style="s2">soup you know and so that was one part</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.380" end="00:26:48.590" style="s2">of it another person who resigned from</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.390" end="00:26:51.770" style="s2">the committee he told me at one point</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.590" end="00:26:54.200" style="s2">look he told me this in a private in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.770" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">coffee shop resignation meeting he said</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.200" end="00:26:58.250" style="s2">my son is fighting Islamic terrorists in</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:00.050" style="s2">the Middle East and you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.250" end="00:27:01.610" style="s2">Dugan who supports Islamic terrorists in</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.050" end="00:27:03.860" style="s2">the Middle East and therefore there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.610" end="00:27:05.030" style="s2">this unbridgeable gap between us you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.860" end="00:27:06.950" style="s2">would just we can&#39;t work together</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.030" end="00:27:10.910" style="s2">because you&#39;re on the side of the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.950" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">effectively which was well I mean I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.910" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">let people make their own judgment about</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:15.830" style="s2">whether yeah whether that&#39;s real I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:19.850" style="s2">I&#39;m over here shaking shaking my head</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.830" end="00:27:23.390" style="s2">and disgust there&#39;s no there was no no</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.850" end="00:27:25.700" style="s2">space given to just understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.390" end="00:27:28.520" style="s2">you have to hold even if you don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.700" end="00:27:31.730" style="s2">if even if you think that they&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.520" end="00:27:33.950" style="s2">enemy it behooves you to study them</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.730" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">in-depth Lee there was no no credence</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.950" end="00:27:38.090" style="s2">given to that very little to put it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:39.920" style="s2">kindly</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.090" end="00:27:42.410" style="s2">but once so one other thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.920" end="00:27:46.490" style="s2">Dugan himself is a multi-faceted</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.410" end="00:27:48.020" style="s2">character so if somebody were I mean now</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.490" end="00:27:49.790" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s different I don&#39;t know but at</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.020" end="00:27:50.990" style="s2">that time if you were just to google</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.790" end="00:27:53.420" style="s2">Alexandre Dugan</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.990" end="00:27:54.980" style="s2">pull him up on Wikipedia you might get</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.420" end="00:27:58.940" style="s2">the impression you know from whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.980" end="00:28:00.260" style="s2">comes up first that he is a to quote you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.940" end="00:28:03.100" style="s2">know somebody&#39;s characterization of him</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.260" end="00:28:05.960" style="s2">and Applebaum a crackpot you know or</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.100" end="00:28:07.340" style="s2">some you could get a bad first</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.960" end="00:28:09.350" style="s2">impression of him if you just pull him</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.340" end="00:28:12.140" style="s2">up on Wikipedia and they may have</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.350" end="00:28:15.320" style="s2">thought that my interest in him was that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.140" end="00:28:17.930" style="s2">I googled something you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.320" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">and he came up and that I&#39;m attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.930" end="00:28:21.320" style="s2">him because he once did an interview</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:23.870" style="s2">with Ahmadinejad or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.320" end="00:28:26.120" style="s2">but the thing is that he is as I say</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.870" end="00:28:26.600" style="s2">multifaceted and I came to his works</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.120" end="00:28:28.070" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.600" end="00:28:30.470" style="s2">walk down you know from the theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.070" end="00:28:33.320" style="s2">the philosophical and I have to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.470" end="00:28:34.850" style="s2">this interesting story so his he has</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.320" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">written about Heidegger he has a few</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.850" end="00:28:38.630" style="s2">books on Heidegger but one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:40.100" style="s2">published in English that&#39;s not one that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.630" end="00:28:42.740" style="s2">I translated although I translated many</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.100" end="00:28:45.500" style="s2">others and when again at the University</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.740" end="00:28:47.750" style="s2">somebody found out that this person had</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.500" end="00:28:49.970" style="s2">a book on Heidegger the rumors</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.750" end="00:28:52.190" style="s2">circulated and got back to me he said</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.970" end="00:28:53.900" style="s2">that he had said it&#39;s not possible that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.190" end="00:28:56.289" style="s2">Dugan wrote that hide of your book</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.900" end="00:28:58.970" style="s2">because you can&#39;t have a person who at</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.289" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">the same time write serious works of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.970" end="00:29:02.419" style="s2">political philosophy and does like what</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.100" style="s2">we can just call here like shitposting</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.419" end="00:29:05.720" style="s2">or you know something like something</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.100" end="00:29:07.220" style="s2">like that in brief right that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.720" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">the same person therefore someone else</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.220" end="00:29:11.210" style="s2">might must have written inside of a book</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:13.370" style="s2">and he thought it had been me so I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.210" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">supposedly the ghostwriter of Dugan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.370" end="00:29:16.460" style="s2">first Heidegger book but in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.919" style="s2">just that Dugan is a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.460" end="00:29:22.460" style="s2">multifaceted figure he&#39;s as comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.919" end="00:29:24.770" style="s2">lecturing about phenomenology Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.460" end="00:29:27.980" style="s2">Plato and Heidegger on one hand in ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.770" end="00:29:29.659" style="s2">that are very good so he&#39;s a great I</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.980" end="00:29:32.059" style="s2">think lecturer and he knows his material</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.659" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">very well and at the same time you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.059" end="00:29:36.110" style="s2">he can turn off his interview and go on</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:38.659" style="s2">the Alex Jones Show and be talking some</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.110" end="00:29:40.520" style="s2">something that is uh less familiar to an</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.659" end="00:29:41.900" style="s2">academic audience let&#39;s say you know and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.520" end="00:29:44.330" style="s2">they weren&#39;t able to put those two</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.900" end="00:29:46.520" style="s2">things together so the Trump thing yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.330" end="00:29:47.929" style="s2">the Russia thing yes the fact that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.520" end="00:29:49.370" style="s2">were faced with someone who doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.929" end="00:29:51.710" style="s2">the model of an academic political</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.370" end="00:29:54.110" style="s2">philosopher all of that was a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.710" end="00:29:56.510" style="s2">and I got to tell you as much as I</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.110" end="00:29:58.100" style="s2">learned writing the dissertation which</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.510" end="00:29:59.780" style="s2">was a lot and as much as I learned</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.100" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">reading all of these people and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.780" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">translating Dugan which I did and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:05.750" style="s2">enjoyed and continue to do seeing how</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.049" style="s2">these professors reacted to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.750" end="00:30:10.010" style="s2">thing was probably the most instructive</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.049" end="00:30:13.190" style="s2">experience that I had on campus because</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.010" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">it just was every hypocrisy and I held I</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.190" end="00:30:15.950" style="s2">held Strauss Ian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:17.539" style="s2">I mean I still hold Strauss in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.950" end="00:30:19.370" style="s2">regard but I held Strauss ian&#39;s in like</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.539" end="00:30:21.309" style="s2">the highest regard so I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.370" end="00:30:23.900" style="s2">they were the most willing to look into</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.309" end="00:30:25.010" style="s2">philosophical questions without turning</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.900" end="00:30:28.030" style="s2">their backs on them and running away</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.010" end="00:30:32.120" style="s2">from them and here I definitely had a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.030" end="00:30:35.090" style="s2">mugged by reality type moment but not in</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.120" end="00:30:37.040" style="s2">the usual way right well you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.090" end="00:30:37.740" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s interesting and worth</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.040" end="00:30:39.600" style="s2">talking to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.740" end="00:30:41.850" style="s2">these days seems to have a similar storm</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.600" end="00:30:43.950" style="s2">a similar story like this you know they</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.850" end="00:30:45.570" style="s2">say if if you&#39;re not getting heat you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.570" end="00:30:49.050" style="s2">right track so clearly you should take</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.580" end="00:30:50.940" style="s2">it as a sign that you&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.050" end="00:30:53.640" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s something worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.940" end="00:30:54.809" style="s2">because oh the guys people if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.640" end="00:30:56.910" style="s2">get any heat if you don&#39;t get any</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.809" end="00:30:58.980" style="s2">pushback what are you doing boring</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.910" end="00:31:00.030" style="s2">nobody cares nobody cares and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.980" end="00:31:01.710" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a terrible way to live</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.030" end="00:31:03.510" style="s2">your life like using that as a metric I</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.710" end="00:31:05.010" style="s2">hate like but you know once they hate</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.510" end="00:31:06.540" style="s2">does start coming you have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.010" end="00:31:09.660" style="s2">think of it as a pot it&#39;s a positive</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.540" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">sign and for me I mean I had an Tifa</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.660" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">come after me I got Docs I got fired I</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">got called a Nazi and racist and all</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:16.290" style="s2">this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:19.170" style="s2">and that wasn&#39;t for studying Dugan or</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.290" end="00:31:20.550" style="s2">Heidegger an actual Nazi it was for just</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.170" end="00:31:23.130" style="s2">talking about whether or not we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.550" end="00:31:25.260" style="s2">have sanctuary cities like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.130" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">should our local jurisdictions disregard</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.260" end="00:31:29.610" style="s2">federal law like that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:31.260" style="s2">pretty reasonable question to me but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.610" end="00:31:33.090" style="s2">got fired for it anyway but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.260" end="00:31:35.610" style="s2">blessing in disguise it&#39;s almost two</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.090" end="00:31:38.580" style="s2">years ago and you know now I get to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.610" end="00:31:40.860" style="s2">this everyday for my living so it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.580" end="00:31:42.360" style="s2">been able to turn it around</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.860" end="00:31:43.890" style="s2">and I&#39;m hoping that you will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.360" end="00:31:45.840" style="s2">turn that experience around and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.890" end="00:31:47.429" style="s2">we didn&#39;t finish the story but you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.840" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">I guess you found some people who were</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.429" end="00:31:51.570" style="s2">gonna ended up coming onto the committee</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:53.100" style="s2">and and and standing up standing by your</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.570" end="00:31:55.559" style="s2">side to get this work done that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.100" end="00:31:57.740" style="s2">it divided the department divided the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.559" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">faculty there were realignment of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.740" end="00:32:02.370" style="s2">friendships and of everything like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.679" style="s2">but eventually I had I had a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.370" end="00:32:05.910" style="s2">supportive committee and you know I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.679" end="00:32:08.010" style="s2">originally planned it that I would have</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.910" end="00:32:09.450" style="s2">like roughly a leftist the liberal and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.010" end="00:32:12.350" style="s2">conservative so that I was speaking to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.450" end="00:32:15.330" style="s2">whole spectrum I ended up having like</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.350" end="00:32:17.610" style="s2">yeah a postmodern Africanist the rabbi</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.330" end="00:32:19.620" style="s2">and you know so a very interesting group</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.610" end="00:32:21.750" style="s2">of people but but the dividing line was</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.620" end="00:32:23.550" style="s2">those who think students must be subject</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.750" end="00:32:25.080" style="s2">to an ideological test and those who</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.550" end="00:32:27.179" style="s2">support the philosophical merit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.080" end="00:32:29.340" style="s2">genuine inquiry so I ended up it was a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.179" end="00:32:30.750" style="s2">blessing in disguise it&#39;s continued to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.340" end="00:32:32.670" style="s2">be like I said I&#39;ve met so many good</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.750" end="00:32:35.250" style="s2">people yourself included this is great</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.670" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">and I met so many good people as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.250" end="00:32:39.030" style="s2">result of what happened I continued to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.820" style="s2">get letters and emails it&#39;s fantastic I</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.030" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">have I shudder when I think about what</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.820" end="00:32:45.570" style="s2">my life would have been like if I had</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:47.070" style="s2">remained on the academic trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.570" end="00:32:48.900" style="s2">where I had to watch my step where I had</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.070" end="00:32:50.910" style="s2">to watch my mouth I mean I still do</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.900" end="00:32:51.539" style="s2">obviously to a certain extent but not</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.910" end="00:32:56.039" style="s2">like it</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.539" end="00:32:58.470" style="s2">there there there was basically just a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.039" end="00:32:59.789" style="s2">gag order right</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.470" end="00:33:01.499" style="s2">you know I&#39;m thinking back one of my</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.789" end="00:33:04.139" style="s2">early philosophy classes was all about</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.499" end="00:33:05.759" style="s2">Marx and I know we actually studied on</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.139" end="00:33:07.590" style="s2">the Jewish Question and I can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.759" end="00:33:09.899" style="s2">remember what my professor said about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.590" end="00:33:12.389" style="s2">but it was a generally positive Marx</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.899" end="00:33:14.100" style="s2">class so I wonder I got to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.389" end="00:33:16.229" style="s2">check my notes it&#39;s just crazy to think</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.100" end="00:33:18.359" style="s2">that I remember now looking back I</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.229" end="00:33:20.340" style="s2">remember reading mark Kusa and like</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.359" end="00:33:21.389" style="s2">reading clear clear critical theory and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.340" end="00:33:24.539" style="s2">all kinds of stuff and it was all</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.389" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">presented to me totally as just this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.539" end="00:33:28.349" style="s2">the way the world is this is the you</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:31.019" style="s2">know don&#39;t even question it there was it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.349" end="00:33:32.909" style="s2">was just all given as a given and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.019" end="00:33:35.190" style="s2">having to go back and and rejigger my</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.909" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">mind so let&#39;s let&#39;s get started actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.190" end="00:33:39.629" style="s2">with the material about Dugan and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:41.009" style="s2">Heidegger and Strauss a one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.629" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">wanted to ask you quick I didn&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.009" end="00:33:44.340" style="s2">this of Ryan Williams president of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.720" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">Claremont Institute as well who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.340" end="00:33:48.119" style="s2">Strauss CM guys what what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:50.460" style="s2">when you say Strauss Ian because I hear</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.119" end="00:33:52.590" style="s2">that term thrown around and I know my</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.460" end="00:33:53.849" style="s2">audience hears it thrown around too what</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.590" end="00:33:55.710" style="s2">what does that mean what does that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.849" end="00:33:56.729" style="s2">general outlook or what does that say</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.710" end="00:33:58.739" style="s2">about somebody if you call them as</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.729" end="00:34:00.690" style="s2">Strauss Ian okay here&#39;s how it put it so</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.739" end="00:34:04.879" style="s2">first of all joseon&#39;s are those people</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.690" end="00:34:07.739" style="s2">who share a view that Leo Strauss was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.879" end="00:34:10.619" style="s2">masterful interpreter of the texts of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.739" end="00:34:13.260" style="s2">political philosophy from Plato to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.619" end="00:34:14.549" style="s2">Nietzsche so not everybody shares that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.260" end="00:34:17.309" style="s2">view there are people who think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.549" end="00:34:20.099" style="s2">Strauss is way of reading texts is</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.309" end="00:34:21.270" style="s2">illegitimate or misleading but for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.099" end="00:34:23.940" style="s2">most part people who call themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.270" end="00:34:26.849" style="s2">joseon&#39;s share Roces view of how to read</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.940" end="00:34:28.889" style="s2">these texts and what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.849" end="00:34:31.829" style="s2">you read them with the utmost respect</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.889" end="00:34:34.679" style="s2">you don&#39;t assume just because someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.829" end="00:34:36.359" style="s2">wrote before you that they knew less</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.679" end="00:34:38.369" style="s2">than you so just because someone wrote</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.359" end="00:34:39.690" style="s2">in a medieval period and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.369" end="00:34:41.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the benefits of modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.690" end="00:34:42.929" style="s2">understanding that we have that we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.700" end="00:34:45.270" style="s2">only read them to learn from their</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.929" end="00:34:47.790" style="s2">mistakes and not to learn the truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.270" end="00:34:50.369" style="s2">about political life or the human life</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.790" end="00:34:51.329" style="s2">that we may have lost in the period</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.369" end="00:34:54.179" style="s2">between then and now</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.329" end="00:34:56.819" style="s2">so one principle of reading is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.179" end="00:34:58.710" style="s2">utmost respect for what a great thinker</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.819" end="00:35:00.390" style="s2">has written you don&#39;t try to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.710" end="00:35:02.760" style="s2">him in terms of the surrounding culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.390" end="00:35:04.230" style="s2">because you can&#39;t really make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.760" end="00:35:05.400" style="s2">the surrounding culture without</p>

<p begin="00:35:08.850" end="00:35:11.610" style="s2">his culture is sort of to put the cart</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.230" end="00:35:14.610" style="s2">before the horse to a certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.610" end="00:35:15.900" style="s2">well you see you can&#39;t understand asin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.610" end="00:35:17.820" style="s2">if you don&#39;t understand Plato it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.190" end="00:35:25.470" style="s2">Strauss ian&#39;s is that they see a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.650" end="00:35:28.200" style="s2">conflict again this is a generalization</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.470" end="00:35:31.220" style="s2">but applicable you know for that reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.200" end="00:35:33.660" style="s2">most of the time a conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.220" end="00:35:36.390" style="s2">philosophy and law or philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.660" end="00:35:39.180" style="s2">politics because politics is the domain</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.390" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">of opinion and philosophy tries to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.180" end="00:35:44.130" style="s2">transform opinion into knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:46.110" style="s2">can have the effect of undermining the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.130" end="00:35:49.380" style="s2">beliefs that are necessary for political</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.110" end="00:35:51.450" style="s2">community or undermining the foundations</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.380" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">of a legal order because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.450" end="00:35:55.230" style="s2">questioning what maybe should be taken</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:57.060" style="s2">as an axiom so the conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.230" end="00:35:58.980" style="s2">philosophy and politics or between</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.060" end="00:36:02.760" style="s2">philosophy and law is a theme for</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.980" end="00:36:05.160" style="s2">Strauss ian&#39;s as is the relationship or</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.760" end="00:36:08.070" style="s2">the tension between philosophy on one</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.160" end="00:36:11.460" style="s2">hand and Revelation on the other so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.070" end="00:36:15.540" style="s2">life lived according to what man can</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.460" end="00:36:18.690" style="s2">know by himself with his own efforts and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.540" end="00:36:22.050" style="s2">the life lived according to obedience to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.690" end="00:36:24.330" style="s2">a super human authority and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.050" end="00:36:26.370" style="s2">trivial because the divine law or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.330" end="00:36:28.950" style="s2">revealed law or the role of religious</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.370" end="00:36:31.170" style="s2">belief has been of decisive importance</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.950" end="00:36:34.620" style="s2">for Western tradition so the theme of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.170" end="00:36:38.340" style="s2">philosophy versus law of philosophy vs.</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.620" end="00:36:40.950" style="s2">Revelation is crucial and incidentally</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.340" end="00:36:43.650" style="s2">it&#39;s also related to how Strauss reads</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.950" end="00:36:45.330" style="s2">texts because his view was that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.650" end="00:36:47.190" style="s2">say that I&#39;m a member of a religious</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.330" end="00:36:52.170" style="s2">community I&#39;m a medieval Islamic thinker</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.190" end="00:36:54.420" style="s2">and I&#39;m also a philosopher so I now live</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.170" end="00:36:56.640" style="s2">in a community constituted by the Sharia</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.420" end="00:36:58.950" style="s2">by the revealed law of the revealed code</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:01.320" style="s2">of Islamic law or in the Jewish context</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.950" end="00:37:03.630" style="s2">by the Torah by the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.320" end="00:37:06.170" style="s2">revealed code of Jewish law and at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.630" end="00:37:08.280" style="s2">same time I see that it rests on certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.170" end="00:37:10.170" style="s2">assumptions like for example that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.280" end="00:37:12.270" style="s2">world is created as opposed to eternal</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.170" end="00:37:14.430" style="s2">for example okay or that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.270" end="00:37:15.780" style="s2">resurrection of the body or the soul so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.430" end="00:37:17.400" style="s2">there are certain beliefs that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.780" end="00:37:19.210" style="s2">inherent to these religious communities</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.400" end="00:37:23.020" style="s2">but as a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.210" end="00:37:24.520" style="s2">I in this example can&#39;t rest can&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.020" end="00:37:27.369" style="s2">it at the belief I actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.520" end="00:37:28.630" style="s2">think about it right is the maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.369" end="00:37:30.250" style="s2">work maybe the arguments for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.630" end="00:37:31.810" style="s2">Eternity of the world are stronger than</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.250" end="00:37:33.609" style="s2">the arguments that the world was created</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.810" end="00:37:37.480" style="s2">after all they have in their favor</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.609" end="00:37:39.070" style="s2">Aristotle whose kid who&#39;s no random</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.480" end="00:37:40.359" style="s2">person right he&#39;s a pretty serious</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.070" end="00:37:42.430" style="s2">thinker he didn&#39;t think the world was</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.359" end="00:37:44.890" style="s2">created we got to take him seriously but</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.430" end="00:37:46.930" style="s2">as a thinker in that context I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.890" end="00:37:48.550" style="s2">just come out and undermine the beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.930" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">that hold the community together so</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.550" end="00:37:54.010" style="s2">Stroh said in such circumstances a</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:56.380" style="s2">philosopher sometimes will employ</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.010" end="00:37:59.589" style="s2">strategies of writing that basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.380" end="00:38:01.570" style="s2">communicate two messages one message to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.589" end="00:38:04.660" style="s2">the superficial reader and another</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.570" end="00:38:08.050" style="s2">message to the far smaller set of slow</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.660" end="00:38:10.660" style="s2">thoughtful careful readers and he made</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.050" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">more he put more on the table than</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.660" end="00:38:14.890" style="s2">anybody else had done before the methods</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:17.020" style="s2">of writing that a philosopher in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.890" end="00:38:21.310" style="s2">situation will use so for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.020" end="00:38:23.230" style="s2">deliberate contradictions another method</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.310" end="00:38:25.300" style="s2">that he mentions is that sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.230" end="00:38:28.150" style="s2">have an author who repeats himself and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.300" end="00:38:30.250" style="s2">he says like as I said earlier but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.150" end="00:38:31.780" style="s2">repetition includes a modification as</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.250" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">well of what was said earlier so if</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.780" end="00:38:35.230" style="s2">you&#39;re reading carefully you see that he</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:37.570" style="s2">said one thing first and then something</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.230" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">else later and you&#39;re supposed to notice</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.570" end="00:38:41.830" style="s2">that if you&#39;re the right type of reader</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:42.940" style="s2">and you&#39;re not supposed to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.830" end="00:38:44.980" style="s2">if you&#39;re the wrong type of reader in</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.940" end="00:38:47.770" style="s2">other words it protects the opinions</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.980" end="00:38:50.619" style="s2">that are necessary for the community and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.770" end="00:38:53.020" style="s2">it also subjects them to questioning for</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.619" end="00:38:54.490" style="s2">the puppies of the philosophical race as</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.020" end="00:38:57.190" style="s2">he put it somewhere for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.490" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">young men who love to think that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.190" end="00:39:03.580" style="s2">fascinating that with that context</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:05.220" style="s2">reading Bronze Age mindset by Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.580" end="00:39:08.290" style="s2">pervert I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.220" end="00:39:11.109" style="s2">that really puts that book into context</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.290" end="00:39:13.089" style="s2">because he I know he&#39;s probably say</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.109" end="00:39:14.650" style="s2">Strauss e&#39;en and I know that he</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.089" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">certainly has studied the ancient texts</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.650" end="00:39:20.109" style="s2">quite a bit but the writing style there</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:22.300" style="s2">was definitely more than one audience in</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.109" end="00:39:24.820" style="s2">in the in the in the way he was writing</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.300" end="00:39:27.490" style="s2">it and some of it was intended to push</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.820" end="00:39:29.380" style="s2">people away and some of and the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.490" end="00:39:30.590" style="s2">it was the sort of hidden messages for</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.380" end="00:39:33.500" style="s2">the people who were really think</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.590" end="00:39:36.380" style="s2">about it and paying attention to it can</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.500" end="00:39:38.600" style="s2">you recommend any books by Biden Strauss</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.380" end="00:39:40.040" style="s2">here that actually speaks to this sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.600" end="00:39:42.620" style="s2">of technique because I&#39;d like to check</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.040" end="00:39:44.390" style="s2">that out personally the source book is</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.620" end="00:39:48.260" style="s2">called persecution in the art of writing</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.390" end="00:39:50.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s where he says in general why</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.260" end="00:39:53.270" style="s2">this type of writing was needed why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.780" end="00:39:55.550" style="s2">a problem and why it hasn&#39;t been noticed</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.270" end="00:39:58.010" style="s2">until he basically put a light on it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.550" end="00:40:00.620" style="s2">then he also has a few studies there of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.010" end="00:40:03.560" style="s2">medieval thinkers where he tries to show</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.620" end="00:40:05.570" style="s2">you how they did this and how to read</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.560" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">them if you read them with this in mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.570" end="00:40:10.040" style="s2">but persecution in the art of writing is</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:12.140" style="s2">the main text for that all right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.040" end="00:40:14.330" style="s2">gonna have to add it to my never-ending</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.140" end="00:40:17.900" style="s2">pile of books yeah you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.330" end="00:40:20.600" style="s2">actually I heard you mention on another</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.900" end="00:40:22.610" style="s2">conversation that people are studying</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.600" end="00:40:24.170" style="s2">and you&#39;re studying Aristotle or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.610" end="00:40:25.490" style="s2">people that in the circles that you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.170" end="00:40:26.360" style="s2">with you know they might look at Plato</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.490" end="00:40:28.730" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.360" end="00:40:30.050" style="s2">and Strauss is view which is very</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.730" end="00:40:31.460" style="s2">important for us if we&#39;re trying to gain</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.050" end="00:40:33.500" style="s2">an understanding of these thinkers is</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.460" end="00:40:36.220" style="s2">that it&#39;s not just the medieval who were</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.500" end="00:40:39.820" style="s2">in a context of a religious community</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.220" end="00:40:43.850" style="s2">but it&#39;s also more generally any</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.820" end="00:40:45.770" style="s2">philosopher always is threatened by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.850" end="00:40:47.990" style="s2">city and a threat to the city and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.770" end="00:40:50.810" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s also always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.990" end="00:40:53.120" style="s2">characteristic of philosophy - of self</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.810" end="00:40:55.130" style="s2">understanding philosophy to write in</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.120" end="00:40:58.430" style="s2">this careful way so one of his great</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.130" end="00:41:00.650" style="s2">discoveries I think is that he provided</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.430" end="00:41:04.370" style="s2">new access even to Plato and Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.650" end="00:41:06.110" style="s2">by saying hey you have rushed so far in</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.370" end="00:41:09.110" style="s2">your interpretation here with modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.110" end="00:41:13.010" style="s2">suppositions and with modern assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.110" end="00:41:16.250" style="s2">that you missed these beautiful details</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.010" end="00:41:18.620" style="s2">these nuances these tucked away little</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.250" end="00:41:22.550" style="s2">gardens in the in the texts that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.620" end="00:41:24.050" style="s2">won&#39;t see if you don&#39;t read them knowing</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.550" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">that Plato may have used these methods</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.050" end="00:41:28.940" style="s2">himself and why he may have after all</p>

<p begin="00:43:47.779" end="00:43:50.539" style="s2">even if they don&#39;t know the names</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.709" end="00:43:52.969" style="s2">they&#39;ve heard of loosely I think the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.539" end="00:43:55.219" style="s2">starting point is this idea a place</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.969" end="00:43:56.270" style="s2">where I started of the fourth political</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.219" end="00:43:57.860" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.270" end="00:44:00.020" style="s2">it&#39;s the name of the first book of his</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.860" end="00:44:02.870" style="s2">that was published in English and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.020" end="00:44:04.760" style="s2">something that he himself saw and sees</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.870" end="00:44:06.770" style="s2">as the cutting edge of his thought as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.760" end="00:44:07.880" style="s2">political theorist and so I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.770" end="00:44:10.130" style="s2">good place to start</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.880" end="00:44:12.770" style="s2">all right the basic idea of the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.130" end="00:44:15.850" style="s2">political theory is as follows the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.770" end="00:44:20.030" style="s2">century was a struggle of ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.850" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2">liberalism communism and fascism because</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.030" end="00:44:24.020" style="s2">those the first second and third</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:26.630" style="s2">political theories and it includes also</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.020" end="00:44:29.170" style="s2">their variants okay shades of liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.630" end="00:44:31.460" style="s2">shades of communism is shades of fascism</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.170" end="00:44:33.500" style="s2">by the end of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.460" end="00:44:36.620" style="s2">liberalism was the last ideology</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.500" end="00:44:39.830" style="s2">standing some people declared that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.620" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">moment liberal triumphalism they said</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.830" end="00:44:45.140" style="s2">this right yeah the end of history the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:47.270" style="s2">basic idea that we have come to the last</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.140" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">if history is the history of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.270" end="00:44:49.610" style="s2">philosophical ideas and here you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:51.410" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.610" end="00:44:54.260" style="s2">we have the last great philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.410" end="00:44:56.300" style="s2">idea human rights universal freedom the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.260" end="00:44:58.130" style="s2">state that guarantees individual rights</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.300" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">and freedoms all of that liberalism was</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.130" end="00:45:05.410" style="s2">seen as it had its triumphalist moment</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:08.930" style="s2">however he says what if you reject</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.410" end="00:45:11.450" style="s2">communism which you do he does fascism</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.930" end="00:45:14.360" style="s2">which she says is to be rejected but</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.450" end="00:45:16.970" style="s2">also liberalism well here you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.360" end="00:45:19.430" style="s2">really left at first with any obvious</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.970" end="00:45:21.740" style="s2">alternative because those three</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.430" end="00:45:23.900" style="s2">exhausted the ideological space in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.740" end="00:45:24.770" style="s2">20th century and by the time liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.900" end="00:45:27.470" style="s2">came out victorious</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.770" end="00:45:30.020" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t a coherent ideological</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.470" end="00:45:32.690" style="s2">alternative now people start to talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.020" end="00:45:34.850" style="s2">populism this that but strictly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.690" end="00:45:37.220" style="s2">there was no obvious theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.850" end="00:45:40.250" style="s2">alternative so he says this is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.220" end="00:45:41.660" style="s2">initial gesture or montmartre logical</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.250" end="00:45:44.270" style="s2">moment of the of the fourth political</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.660" end="00:45:46.790" style="s2">theory if we reject all three of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.270" end="00:45:48.230" style="s2">liberalism communism and fascism and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.790" end="00:45:50.510" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get caught up in the trap</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.230" end="00:45:52.340" style="s2">of believing their exhaustive that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.510" end="00:45:54.410" style="s2">exhaust all the alternatives we should</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.340" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">declare the space of a fourth political</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.410" end="00:45:58.490" style="s2">theory and just that first declaration</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:00.830" style="s2">the naming the carving out of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.490" end="00:46:03.290" style="s2">contextual space for thinking already</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.830" end="00:46:06.140" style="s2">gives you a breath of fresh air from</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.290" end="00:46:07.940" style="s2">what is on the other side of it right</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.140" end="00:46:10.200" style="s2">from having to choose between those</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.940" end="00:46:11.790" style="s2">three and I just want to give</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.200" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">I&#39;d hear okay because one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.790" end="00:46:15.570" style="s2">this resonated with me personally when I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:16.140" style="s2">was at university British Columbia back</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.570" end="00:46:19.560" style="s2">in the day</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.140" end="00:46:21.869" style="s2">I was reading Strauss and I had an</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.560" end="00:46:25.109" style="s2">interest in Israel okay the State of</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.869" end="00:46:26.820" style="s2">Israel and I noticed that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.109" end="00:46:28.890" style="s2">things were immediately called fascists</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.820" end="00:46:30.270" style="s2">this logic still happens every day today</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.890" end="00:46:31.740" style="s2">not just with Strauss not just with this</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.270" end="00:46:33.510" style="s2">room with a million other phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.740" end="00:46:36.359" style="s2">they&#39;re called fascists and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.510" end="00:46:38.369" style="s2">at it you see the logic if you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.359" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">liberal and you&#39;re not to the left of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.369" end="00:46:41.880" style="s2">liberal there&#39;s nothing else you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.079" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">be conceptually about fascist in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.880" end="00:46:45.570" style="s2">model and therefore you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:47.640" style="s2">understand why everybody lumps you</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.570" end="00:46:49.109" style="s2">together with that title but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.640" end="00:46:50.280" style="s2">is that those three do not exhaust the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.109" end="00:46:52.530" style="s2">options right they don&#39;t exhaust the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.280" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">possibilities so he declares the space</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.530" end="00:46:55.950" style="s2">of a fourth political theory that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:58.470" style="s2">already an accomplishment he says in his</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.950" end="00:47:00.150" style="s2">book that I don&#39;t understand why people</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.470" end="00:47:01.170" style="s2">who don&#39;t hear about the fourth who hear</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.150" end="00:47:02.730" style="s2">about the fourth clinical theory don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.170" end="00:47:04.740" style="s2">open a bottle of champagne and celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.730" end="00:47:07.079" style="s2">that now they can think freely outside</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.740" end="00:47:08.280" style="s2">of liberalism communism fascism but then</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.079" end="00:47:10.460" style="s2">you get to the next step and you say</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.280" end="00:47:13.740" style="s2">okay well alright you&#39;ve cleared a space</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.460" end="00:47:15.540" style="s2">that is says what it&#39;s not can you say</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.740" end="00:47:17.550" style="s2">anything about what it is or what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.540" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">positive components might be and here</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.550" end="00:47:23.339" style="s2">his analysis is something as yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:26.540" style="s2">let&#39;s stop it yeah so you said positive</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.339" end="00:47:28.740" style="s2">components defined as what it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.540" end="00:47:30.030" style="s2">clarify so the negative is were not</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.740" end="00:47:31.740" style="s2">going to be the first second or third</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.030" end="00:47:33.720" style="s2">political theory that creates the space</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.740" end="00:47:35.819" style="s2">for thinking but then you can say well</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.720" end="00:47:37.069" style="s2">what is going to be in that space and he</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.819" end="00:47:39.300" style="s2">does have something to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.069" end="00:47:41.579" style="s2">like as an option</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.300" end="00:47:46.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what but if you&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.579" end="00:47:49.650" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s does it reject all the tenets</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.440" end="00:47:52.109" style="s2">of liberalism or is it just saying this</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.650" end="00:47:54.660" style="s2">is not like a holistic adoption of</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.109" end="00:47:58.800" style="s2">liberal so I&#39;m like can is this saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.660" end="00:48:00.450" style="s2">like individual rights bad here&#39;s how he</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.800" end="00:48:02.220" style="s2">puts it oh I&#39;m gonna give you my image</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.450" end="00:48:04.050" style="s2">for it so imagine that each of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.220" end="00:48:06.390" style="s2">liberalism communism fascism is like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.050" end="00:48:09.030" style="s2">house of cards okay so it has components</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.390" end="00:48:11.250" style="s2">but it&#39;s a whole thing so he says you</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.030" end="00:48:13.260" style="s2">can perform the following operation you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.250" end="00:48:15.089" style="s2">can break the house of cards</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.260" end="00:48:17.160" style="s2">in other words break the whole ISM as</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.089" end="00:48:19.650" style="s2">you said of this system as an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.160" end="00:48:22.500" style="s2">and now you&#39;re left with just its</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.650" end="00:48:24.150" style="s2">component pieces that have been to</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.500" end="00:48:26.039" style="s2">switch metaphors there</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.150" end="00:48:28.049" style="s2">biological charge has now been like</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.039" end="00:48:30.210" style="s2">removed from them you see they&#39;ve been D</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.049" end="00:48:32.910" style="s2">ideologized and just become components</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.210" end="00:48:34.829" style="s2">you see so he says what we could do is</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.910" end="00:48:38.730" style="s2">we can perform this operation we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.829" end="00:48:40.589" style="s2">dismantle the conceptual schema or house</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.730" end="00:48:43.740" style="s2">of cards of each of these systems and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.589" end="00:48:46.920" style="s2">then look to see what of the pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.740" end="00:48:49.500" style="s2">are left over can be used used in</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.920" end="00:48:50.789" style="s2">thinking about our alternatives so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.500" end="00:48:52.890" style="s2">here&#39;s how he says that should be done</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.789" end="00:48:54.690" style="s2">he says in each case how do you make the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.890" end="00:48:57.210" style="s2">house of cards fall he says you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.690" end="00:48:59.069" style="s2">reject some key component of each theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.210" end="00:49:01.079" style="s2">and when you reject that component it</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.069" end="00:49:03.150" style="s2">will no longer be an ideological hole</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.079" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">and when it&#39;s no longer an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.150" end="00:49:07.859" style="s2">hole you can pick from it so in</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:10.200" style="s2">liberalism he totally rejects the idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.859" end="00:49:11.520" style="s2">of the individual he says you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.200" end="00:49:13.619" style="s2">liberalism without the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.520" end="00:49:16.289" style="s2">individual so I&#39;m going to reject the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.619" end="00:49:18.569" style="s2">idea of individual and from liberalism I</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.289" end="00:49:20.130" style="s2">can borrow its emphasis on or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.569" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">useful in the construction of a fourth</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.130" end="00:49:25.020" style="s2">political theory is the emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:26.279" style="s2">freedom but what&#39;s anathema is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.020" end="00:49:29.130" style="s2">definition of the human being as an</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.279" end="00:49:29.640" style="s2">individual and also the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.130" end="00:49:31.770" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.640" end="00:49:34.109" style="s2">so he says same thing in communism what</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.770" end="00:49:35.700" style="s2">we&#39;re going to reject is linear</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.109" end="00:49:39.390" style="s2">temporality the idea that history</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.700" end="00:49:42.270" style="s2">progresses to from point A to point zero</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.390" end="00:49:44.520" style="s2">point Z is going to be as it is in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.270" end="00:49:46.980" style="s2">model we&#39;re gonna reject the linearity</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.520" end="00:49:50.220" style="s2">of time we&#39;re also going to reject the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.980" end="00:49:52.500" style="s2">class centric analysis because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.220" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t say class isn&#39;t important but</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.500" end="00:49:56.789" style="s2">he says class is not all-important so</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:58.980" style="s2">you reject the centrality of class but</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.789" end="00:50:01.410" style="s2">he says we&#39;re going to adopt as useful</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.980" end="00:50:04.410" style="s2">and as significant its critique of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.410" end="00:50:08.549" style="s2">capitalism so there after all there are</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.410" end="00:50:11.190" style="s2">profound insights in in communist</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.549" end="00:50:12.420" style="s2">political theory about the drawbacks of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.190" end="00:50:14.819" style="s2">capitalism and from the third political</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.420" end="00:50:17.849" style="s2">theory fascism which by the way I should</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.819" end="00:50:19.529" style="s2">add he in the book he says fascism on</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.849" end="00:50:21.089" style="s2">one hand and Nazis among the other he</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.529" end="00:50:23.670" style="s2">distinguishes them they&#39;re both variants</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.089" end="00:50:26.579" style="s2">of the third political theory in Nazism</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.670" end="00:50:29.309" style="s2">he rejects the emphasis on race and on</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.579" end="00:50:32.010" style="s2">supremacy and in fascist political</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.309" end="00:50:33.510" style="s2">theory he rejects that statism because</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.010" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">they&#39;re separate things and fascist</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.510" end="00:50:38.190" style="s2">political theory after all is just</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:39.960" style="s2">- distorts light looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.190" end="00:50:41.610" style="s2">deification of the state so he says</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.960" end="00:50:43.890" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna reject all of that but what</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.610" end="00:50:45.930" style="s2">can we borrow so if we borrow freedom</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.890" end="00:50:48.030" style="s2">from liberalism as you know important</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.930" end="00:50:49.950" style="s2">category we borrow the critique of</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.030" end="00:50:52.200" style="s2">capitalism from communism what could</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.950" end="00:50:54.270" style="s2">possibly be of value in the third</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.200" end="00:50:56.580" style="s2">political theory especially if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.270" end="00:50:59.460" style="s2">rejected you know race and supremacy and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.580" end="00:51:03.150" style="s2">statism so he says that you can borrow</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.460" end="00:51:05.790" style="s2">the notion of the ethnos now the ethnos</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.150" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">is not the race and Dugan has a textbook</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.790" end="00:51:10.860" style="s2">on ethanol sociology which i translated</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.830" style="s2">it&#39;s available in english and you get</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.860" end="00:51:15.570" style="s2">there an understanding of what he means</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.830" end="00:51:17.160" style="s2">including his rejection of racism what</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.570" end="00:51:19.440" style="s2">he means what schools of thought he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.160" end="00:51:21.600" style="s2">drawing on and why the ethnos might be</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:23.640" style="s2">important and he says liberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.600" end="00:51:27.030" style="s2">communism they totally erased the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.640" end="00:51:29.820" style="s2">of the ethnos of let&#39;s say of the of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.030" end="00:51:31.230" style="s2">what studied in cultural anthropology he</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.820" end="00:51:34.200" style="s2">said they didn&#39;t really have space for</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.230" end="00:51:37.080" style="s2">that and could you can you define it for</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.200" end="00:51:39.210" style="s2">me well basically it&#39;s the study of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.080" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">a study of societies from their simplest</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.210" end="00:51:44.340" style="s2">to their most complex but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">interpret the sus the society as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.340" end="00:51:50.220" style="s2">result of abstract individuals coming</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:52.950" style="s2">together it interprets society as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.220" end="00:51:56.100" style="s2">result of a shared community of language</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.950" end="00:51:58.380" style="s2">and belief that shares a view of its own</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.100" end="00:52:00.390" style="s2">origin now he says though it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.380" end="00:52:02.580" style="s2">question of whether that belief is or</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.390" end="00:52:05.100" style="s2">isn&#39;t accurate because we&#39;re not dealing</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.580" end="00:52:08.070" style="s2">with the genetics we&#39;re not dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.100" end="00:52:10.320" style="s2">race we&#39;re not dealing even with natural</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.070" end="00:52:12.870" style="s2">science we&#39;re dealing with cultural</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.320" end="00:52:14.940" style="s2">anthropology with social science with</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.870" end="00:52:17.250" style="s2">the logic of belief and with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.940" end="00:52:18.810" style="s2">structures of society so in his that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.250" end="00:52:21.000" style="s2">mythology book let me just say briefly</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.810" end="00:52:23.430" style="s2">he goes from the simplest which he calls</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.000" end="00:52:25.170" style="s2">the ethnos to another model which he</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.430" end="00:52:26.850" style="s2">calls in russian than that would you</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.170" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">could say it&#39;s sort of like the folk or</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.850" end="00:52:31.500" style="s2">the people but not a people like an</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:32.850" style="s2">agglomeration of individuals the people</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.500" end="00:52:34.350" style="s2">where you say like German people or</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.850" end="00:52:36.270" style="s2">Spanish people okay so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.350" end="00:52:37.980" style="s2">ethnos you have the multi-ethnic folk</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.270" end="00:52:40.560" style="s2">then you have the nation like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.980" end="00:52:43.020" style="s2">nation-state civil society global</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.560" end="00:52:46.860" style="s2">society and post society so it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.020" end="00:52:48.840" style="s2">model of social structures and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.860" end="00:52:50.309" style="s2">complexity and for example social</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.309" end="00:52:54.449" style="s2">the figure of the Shaymin the figure of</p>

<p begin="00:52:54.449" end="00:52:58.589" style="s2">know bourgeoisie so it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.549" end="00:52:59.969" style="s2">whole analysis but he says there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.589" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">room for that really in these other</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.969" end="00:53:05.969" style="s2">models and there were thinkers who were</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:07.049" style="s2">somehow within they weren&#39;t liberals</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.969" end="00:53:08.670" style="s2">they weren&#39;t communists they&#39;re called</p>

<p begin="00:53:08.670" end="00:53:11.849" style="s2">there was sort of like internal</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.019" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">dissidents against the Nazi regime to a</p>

<p begin="00:53:16.529" end="00:53:20.039" style="s2">right so these are all figures that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.269" end="00:53:22.109" style="s2">important for Dugan and he says look</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.039" end="00:53:24.809" style="s2">that&#39;s just something that we can draw</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.109" end="00:53:27.209" style="s2">on not to necessarily reproduce it one</p>

<p begin="00:53:30.599" end="00:53:34.380" style="s2">political alternative that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.969" end="00:53:36.900" style="s2">things that the fourth political theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.380" end="00:53:38.969" style="s2">is and he says actually this lit this</p>

<p begin="00:53:38.969" end="00:53:44.309" style="s2">study it like if you no I am NOT third</p>

<p begin="00:53:44.309" end="00:53:48.809" style="s2">or first local theory you can then study</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.380" end="00:53:50.579" style="s2">the resources of those thinkers without</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.809" end="00:53:52.650" style="s2">feeling like you&#39;re identifying with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.579" end="00:53:55.589" style="s2">total ideology so there may be something</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.650" end="00:53:57.509" style="s2">valuable in Derrida and doulas or in</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.589" end="00:53:59.880" style="s2">somebody else where you take those</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.509" end="00:54:02.459" style="s2">aspects of thought without buying the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.880" end="00:54:04.769" style="s2">whole ideology so somehow his method is</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.459" end="00:54:07.499" style="s2">to free up the serious reconsideration</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.769" end="00:54:09.719" style="s2">of all of these ideological alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.499" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">not to reproduce them but to borrow and</p>

<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:21.929" style="s2">many questions the first question that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.109" end="00:54:24.089" style="s2">comes to mind is what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.929" end="00:54:27.539" style="s2">reject the individual but embrace</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.089" end="00:54:30.539" style="s2">freedom whose freedom if not the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.539" end="00:54:34.199" style="s2">individuals so the great question very</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.539" end="00:54:36.989" style="s2">natural question to ask so his view is</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.199" end="00:54:39.689" style="s2">that I think the simplest way to see</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.989" end="00:54:41.910" style="s2">what he means is that there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.689" end="00:54:43.979" style="s2">being a human being than being an</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.910" end="00:54:45.719" style="s2">individual individual is an</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.979" end="00:54:49.559" style="s2">interpretation of a more basic</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.719" end="00:54:52.589" style="s2">experience called being human and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.559" end="00:54:54.900" style="s2">concept of individual is already it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.589" end="00:54:56.519" style="s2">somehow a constraining over</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.900" end="00:54:58.709" style="s2">interpretation of this broader</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.519" end="00:55:01.559" style="s2">experience of being human that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.709" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">exhaust what it means to be human it</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.559" end="00:55:05.380" style="s2">actually limits it it could be</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:07.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a useful limitation in some ways it</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.380" end="00:55:10.090" style="s2">produces certain results not all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.780" end="00:55:13.030" style="s2">which are a problem but it somehow</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.090" end="00:55:15.610" style="s2">blocks genuine access to what it means</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.030" end="00:55:18.600" style="s2">to be human and I should add that Straus</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.610" end="00:55:21.130" style="s2">a sorry Dugan says that&#39;s true of</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.600" end="00:55:23.380" style="s2">identification of us as class</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.130" end="00:55:26.320" style="s2">consciousness as well as identification</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.380" end="00:55:28.540" style="s2">of us as race or as status he says all</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.320" end="00:55:31.350" style="s2">of those interpretations of human</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.540" end="00:55:34.300" style="s2">existence are misleading they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.350" end="00:55:36.610" style="s2">they missed the mark and they obscure</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.300" end="00:55:38.470" style="s2">the phenomenon so one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.610" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">components and this is where we open the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.470" end="00:55:43.600" style="s2">door to Heidegger and things get even</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:46.090" style="s2">more philosophical than they have been</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.600" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">up to this point of the analysis he says</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.090" end="00:55:48.520" style="s2">okay if we&#39;re gonna reject the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:49.660" style="s2">individual we&#39;re gonna reject the class</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.520" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna reject the race and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.660" end="00:55:53.950" style="s2">going to reject the state what will be</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:57.670" style="s2">at the center of the fourth political</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.950" end="00:55:59.770" style="s2">theory and he says it&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.670" end="00:56:02.050" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be what Heidegger calls</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.770" end="00:56:04.360" style="s2">and in his works das eine in other words</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.050" end="00:56:07.660" style="s2">the most basic human existence that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.360" end="00:56:11.140" style="s2">hasn&#39;t yet been obscured by self</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.660" end="00:56:13.120" style="s2">interpretation you see and he says if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.140" end="00:56:15.220" style="s2">take das eine as the fourth political as</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.120" end="00:56:17.230" style="s2">the actor or agent or center of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.220" end="00:56:19.800" style="s2">fourth political theory we now have</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.230" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">access to the whole philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.800" end="00:56:25.000" style="s2">apparatus methodology terminology and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:28.420" style="s2">everything that Heidegger puts on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.000" end="00:56:30.820" style="s2">table without falling into any one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.420" end="00:56:33.190" style="s2">the three political theories because</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.820" end="00:56:35.500" style="s2">although it&#39;s true that Heidegger was a</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.190" end="00:56:38.230" style="s2">member of the Nazi Party it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.500" end="00:56:40.210" style="s2">that his philosophy is properly</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.230" end="00:56:42.130" style="s2">characterized as a Nazi philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.210" end="00:56:43.780" style="s2">for those people who may be listening</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.130" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">who don&#39;t buy it I appeal to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.780" end="00:56:47.410" style="s2">authority of Strauss who said that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:48.700" style="s2">not enough to understand how to curse</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.410" end="00:56:50.140" style="s2">thought the fact that he was a Nazi but</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.700" end="00:56:51.610" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to appeal to cirrhosis</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.140" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">authority you can look at Heidegger zone</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.610" end="00:56:57.640" style="s2">writing or take my word for it</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:59.980" style="s2">so Dugan says if you put das eine or as</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.640" end="00:57:01.240" style="s2">I say this our human being that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.980" end="00:57:02.920" style="s2">been constrained yet in its self</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.240" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">interpretation at the center of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.920" end="00:57:08.290" style="s2">political theory there&#39;s a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:10.870" style="s2">freedom there that is not reducible to</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.290" end="00:57:13.330" style="s2">or identical with the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.870" end="00:57:16.210" style="s2">understanding of freedom you see and</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.330" end="00:57:17.019" style="s2">it&#39;s not there&#39;s no expectation that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.210" end="00:57:19.779" style="s2">know what that means</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.019" end="00:57:21.159" style="s2">right away right I mean after all he had</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.779" end="00:57:23.499" style="s2">to write books on Heidegger and develop</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.159" end="00:57:25.989" style="s2">this idea and but one of the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.499" end="00:57:27.999" style="s2">things for example he has a book where</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.989" end="00:57:30.519" style="s2">one of the titles is experiments and</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.999" end="00:57:32.979" style="s2">existential politics because this hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.519" end="00:57:35.169" style="s2">really been done before in this way but</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.979" end="00:57:37.390" style="s2">he&#39;s saying if we want an alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.169" end="00:57:39.039" style="s2">the status quo we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.390" end="00:57:40.449" style="s2">rethink some things from a new</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.039" end="00:57:42.669" style="s2">perspective we don&#39;t just want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.449" end="00:57:45.219" style="s2">recycle liberalism versus leftism</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.669" end="00:57:48.819" style="s2">leftism versus Nazism Nazism versus</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.219" end="00:57:51.759" style="s2">liberalism he&#39;s like stop that and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.819" end="00:57:54.609" style="s2">go deeper or let&#39;s go up or let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.759" end="00:57:57.219" style="s2">around let&#39;s find a new ground a new</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.609" end="00:57:59.349" style="s2">foundation a new topology or topography</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.219" end="00:58:02.679" style="s2">and Heidegger is at the center of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.349" end="00:58:04.839" style="s2">for him and this most basic human</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.679" end="00:58:08.229" style="s2">existence that hasn&#39;t been limited by</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.839" end="00:58:10.569" style="s2">self interpretation is it even possible</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.229" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">to acknowledge or understand that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.569" end="00:58:16.059" style="s2">state of being given that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:19.419" style="s2">even acknowledge it you have to implore</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.059" end="00:58:21.549" style="s2">some level of self interpretation or</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.419" end="00:58:23.799" style="s2">analysis yes so it is but it&#39;s a return</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.549" end="00:58:26.169" style="s2">because we always find ourselves already</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.799" end="00:58:28.599" style="s2">in a mode of self interpretation right</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.169" end="00:58:31.089" style="s2">we we&#39;re never encountering ourselves or</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.599" end="00:58:33.579" style="s2">the world or anybody else uninterpreted</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.089" end="00:58:35.259" style="s2">so we&#39;re already in a set of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.579" end="00:58:37.569" style="s2">interpretations that&#39;s fine Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.259" end="00:58:40.089" style="s2">acknowledges that he has to because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.569" end="00:58:42.219" style="s2">the fact but the question is can you</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.089" end="00:58:44.019" style="s2">return from the understanding of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.219" end="00:58:46.419" style="s2">fact or from the observation of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.019" end="00:58:49.179" style="s2">fact too can you sort of turn your</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.419" end="00:58:50.529" style="s2">attention to your set to the act of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.179" end="00:58:52.719" style="s2">interpretation and to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.529" end="00:58:54.669" style="s2">you&#39;re self interpreting being and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.719" end="00:58:56.769" style="s2">gets the ball rolling so Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.669" end="00:58:58.630" style="s2">acknowledges the circularity here you</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.769" end="00:59:01.029" style="s2">can never get outside of interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.630" end="00:59:02.469" style="s2">but you can sort of as he puts the point</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.029" end="00:59:04.449" style="s2">is not to get outside of the circle but</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.469" end="00:59:07.479" style="s2">to get into it in the right way to see</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.449" end="00:59:10.299" style="s2">how it&#39;s operating and to move from how</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.479" end="00:59:12.039" style="s2">we normally are namely assuming that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.299" end="00:59:13.739" style="s2">already know what&#39;s what not taking our</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.039" end="00:59:15.429" style="s2">interpretations for granted or</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.739" end="00:59:16.989" style="s2">interpreting but without a clear</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.429" end="00:59:19.689" style="s2">understanding of how we&#39;re doing that or</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.989" end="00:59:23.919" style="s2">what or in what terms and returning to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.689" end="00:59:26.709" style="s2">ourselves in our basic constitution and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.919" end="00:59:30.020" style="s2">ground that&#39;s Heidegger largely I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.709" end="00:59:33.170" style="s2">the his 1927 book being in time</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.020" end="00:59:36.950" style="s2">that isn&#39;t an attempt to affect that</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.170" end="00:59:40.610" style="s2">return of our thinking and our atonement</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.950" end="00:59:43.250" style="s2">to the being that we are I returned from</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.610" end="00:59:46.280" style="s2">our normal everyday experience of</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.250" end="00:59:49.370" style="s2">ourselves and others and so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.280" end="00:59:51.350" style="s2">much of a reorientation but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.370" end="00:59:53.930" style="s2">definitely not a black box it&#39;s not an</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.980" end="01:00:33.080" style="s2">putting my brain to this as best I can</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.770" end="01:00:35.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a storm so many questions so in</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.080" end="01:00:37.850" style="s2">summary do getting rejected out of</p>

<p begin="01:00:42.380" end="01:00:47.300" style="s2">analysis that means like capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.750" end="01:00:49.070" style="s2">necessarily leads to communism etc and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.300" end="01:00:52.040" style="s2">that in communism</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.070" end="01:00:53.840" style="s2">there&#39;s the focus on the the property</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.040" end="01:00:56.660" style="s2">owners and the workers and that&#39;s sort</p>

<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:02.840" style="s2">very Marxist thought right and then also</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.070" end="01:01:06.650" style="s2">rejected the emphasis on race and</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.840" end="01:01:09.530" style="s2">statism from fascism and nazism accepted</p>

<p begin="01:01:09.530" end="01:01:14.630" style="s2">also from communism accepted a critique</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.470" end="01:01:15.920" style="s2">of capitalism so that begs a begs a</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.630" end="01:01:17.360" style="s2">question is not the right thing it</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.920" end="01:01:20.200" style="s2">brings up the question what would be in</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.360" end="01:01:23.630" style="s2">its place and then third accepts from</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.200" end="01:01:26.120" style="s2">fascism or Nazism this idea of ethnos</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.630" end="01:01:28.490" style="s2">which is not race but I wrote down a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.120" end="01:01:30.890" style="s2">shared imagine order is that some as I</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.490" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">found write that does OK shared imagined</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.890" end="01:01:35.390" style="s2">order to me that sounds like Hariri and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:38.170" style="s2">the book sapiens that I&#39;ve read a few</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.390" end="01:01:40.490" style="s2">years ago about us organizing around</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.170" end="01:01:43.200" style="s2">imagined stories right that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.490" end="01:01:45.900" style="s2">that we gather it struck me is</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.200" end="01:01:48.900" style="s2">when people say civic nationalism is</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.900" end="01:01:51.390" style="s2">that similar in do you think is a civic</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.900" end="01:01:52.940" style="s2">nationalism like but people would</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.390" end="01:01:56.040" style="s2">purport that we have the United States</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.940" end="01:01:57.420" style="s2">not based on race some people say not</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.040" end="01:02:00.240" style="s2">based on race but based around an idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.420" end="01:02:02.609" style="s2">and concepts is that would that fall</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.240" end="01:02:04.859" style="s2">within this ethnos idea yeah and dunno</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.609" end="01:02:06.720" style="s2">well in Duggan&#39;s model it&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.859" end="01:02:09.300" style="s2">society civic nationalism and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.720" end="01:02:11.990" style="s2">society that sees itself as as based</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.300" end="01:02:14.040" style="s2">around an idea or comprised of</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.990" end="01:02:17.579" style="s2">individuals related in such in such a</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.040" end="01:02:20.400" style="s2">way but what he says is that in all of</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.579" end="01:02:22.290" style="s2">these social organizations from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.400" end="01:02:24.420" style="s2">simplest to the most complex so for</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.290" end="01:02:25.859" style="s2">example you can say even beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.420" end="01:02:28.140" style="s2">American idea you have the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.859" end="01:02:29.430" style="s2">global citizenship right where you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.140" end="01:02:32.670" style="s2">longer art it&#39;s not civic nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.430" end="01:02:35.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like global identity right</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.670" end="01:02:37.260" style="s2">globalism and beyond globalism you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.250" end="01:02:39.869" style="s2">the identity that rejects even human</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.260" end="01:02:42.570" style="s2">identity and begins to say a post human</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.869" end="01:02:44.040" style="s2">post social order where no what matters</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.570" end="01:02:45.930" style="s2">is what we have in common with all</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.040" end="01:02:48.270" style="s2">sentient beings or maybe at some point</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.930" end="01:02:50.460" style="s2">with just all life period right so in</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.270" end="01:02:52.260" style="s2">that total model he sees civic</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.460" end="01:02:54.180" style="s2">nationalism as one among a number of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.260" end="01:02:58.560" style="s2">alternatives but the crucial thing is</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.180" end="01:03:01.920" style="s2">that in no case is the smaller shared</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.560" end="01:03:05.900" style="s2">ethnic identity erased it&#39;s only pushed</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.920" end="01:03:08.760" style="s2">deeper and deeper down in the basic</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.900" end="01:03:10.800" style="s2">fraction you know so it&#39;s like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.760" end="01:03:12.810" style="s2">always there ethnic identity is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.800" end="01:03:16.440" style="s2">simplest identity even in a complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.810" end="01:03:18.839" style="s2">society so it&#39;s again he has a model on</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.440" end="01:03:20.760" style="s2">it it&#39;s hard to necessarily to walk</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.839" end="01:03:23.369" style="s2">through it in detail but he definitely</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.760" end="01:03:26.160" style="s2">has an account of civic identity and of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.369" end="01:03:29.940" style="s2">the shared national idea as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.160" end="01:03:32.190" style="s2">like a more narrow tribal order or the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.940" end="01:03:36.000" style="s2">globalist alternative that&#39;s all in his</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.190" end="01:03:37.470" style="s2">in his work got it okay so I&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.000" end="01:03:39.750" style="s2">to see the picture here and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.470" end="01:03:41.010" style="s2">rejected some things we&#39;ve accepted some</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.750" end="01:03:42.630" style="s2">things and now we&#39;re starting to put</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.010" end="01:03:45.300" style="s2">some things into the box and one of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.630" end="01:03:46.950" style="s2">was this the idea and I I didn&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.300" end="01:03:48.720" style="s2">exact name but it came from Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.950" end="01:03:50.849" style="s2">about the most basic human existence</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.720" end="01:03:52.339" style="s2">that has been limited in the past by</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.849" end="01:03:56.520" style="s2">self interpretations right boss this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.339" end="01:03:58.320" style="s2">das I am alright I sign okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.520" end="01:04:00.180" style="s2">so now we&#39;ve added that what else are we</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.320" end="01:04:02.490" style="s2">adding to the mix okay so at one point</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.180" end="01:04:06.060" style="s2">Dugan says the following that the fourth</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.490" end="01:04:10.280" style="s2">political theory has you could see it as</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.060" end="01:04:12.810" style="s2">having like a body soul and spirit which</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.280" end="01:04:17.010" style="s2">correspond to the following disciplines</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.810" end="01:04:18.960" style="s2">the body is geopolitics the soul is</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.010" end="01:04:22.860" style="s2">ethno sociology which we discussed</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.960" end="01:04:24.660" style="s2">briefly the spirit is theology and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.860" end="01:04:26.520" style="s2">deepest Center is Heidegger so this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.660" end="01:04:29.850" style="s2">just another way of seeing it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.520" end="01:04:33.030" style="s2">total it&#39;s not just the philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.850" end="01:04:35.640" style="s2">model it&#39;s also a worldview that tries</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.030" end="01:04:37.590" style="s2">to reconfigure the disciplines like the</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.640" end="01:04:39.240" style="s2">scientific disciplines so let me tell</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.590" end="01:04:42.110" style="s2">you what I mean he says in our</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.240" end="01:04:44.510" style="s2">prevailing model the the number one</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.110" end="01:04:47.850" style="s2">disciplines are economics and law</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.510" end="01:04:50.610" style="s2">liberalism is fundamentally economics</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.850" end="01:04:52.530" style="s2">and law so the rejection of liberalism</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.610" end="01:04:55.620" style="s2">would be something else it wouldn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.530" end="01:04:58.380" style="s2">be another form of economics and law it</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.620" end="01:05:01.650" style="s2">has a totally different Constitution of</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.380" end="01:05:04.350" style="s2">the sciences and geopolitics becomes an</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.650" end="01:05:06.930" style="s2">important component of that for him now</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.350" end="01:05:09.540" style="s2">there&#39;s another big discussion here but</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.930" end="01:05:12.060" style="s2">he put his money where his mouth is in</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.540" end="01:05:14.490" style="s2">the Russian context and made geopolitics</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.060" end="01:05:15.780" style="s2">a thing in Russia you could say he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.490" end="01:05:18.120" style="s2">established a Russian school of</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.780" end="01:05:20.370" style="s2">geopolitics he had admit he had a great</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.120" end="01:05:22.170" style="s2">influence as I understand in military</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.370" end="01:05:23.670" style="s2">circles after the collapse of the Soviet</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.170" end="01:05:26.250" style="s2">Union because they found themselves</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.670" end="01:05:28.290" style="s2">first of all really without a clearer</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.250" end="01:05:29.730" style="s2">without a clear enemy without a clear</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.290" end="01:05:31.980" style="s2">identity without a clear self</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.730" end="01:05:33.990" style="s2">understanding and he drew on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.980" end="01:05:36.060" style="s2">resources of classical geopolitical</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.990" end="01:05:38.580" style="s2">thinkers who see the division between</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.060" end="01:05:41.430" style="s2">land power and sea power and some other</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.580" end="01:05:43.620" style="s2">components like this and he began</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.430" end="01:05:45.990" style="s2">teaching courses on geopolitics and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.620" end="01:05:48.210" style="s2">later the is geopolitical a textbook</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.990" end="01:05:50.520" style="s2">became assigned reading and geopolitics</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.210" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">became a discipline in Russia where you</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.520" end="01:05:57.180" style="s2">could see that NATO the logic of like</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.520" end="01:05:59.340" style="s2">American Western NATO activity and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.180" end="01:06:02.340" style="s2">meaning of the Russian opposition to</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.340" end="01:06:04.020" style="s2">that so that&#39;s some some of that was</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.340" end="01:06:05.820" style="s2">known about Dugan when I started my work</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.020" end="01:06:08.280" style="s2">that he&#39;s a geopolitical thinker because</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.820" end="01:06:08.760" style="s2">some of his main your reputation and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.280" end="01:06:10.230" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.760" end="01:06:13.430" style="s2">had to do with that for example the</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.230" end="01:06:16.080" style="s2">infamous book foundations of geopolitics</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.430" end="01:06:18.150" style="s2">but almost nobody really knew these</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.080" end="01:06:19.410" style="s2">other aspects of his thought even though</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.150" end="01:06:20.790" style="s2">they were available but just nobody</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.410" end="01:06:22.740" style="s2">seemed to have paid much attention to</p>

<p begin="01:07:16.980" end="01:07:20.910" style="s2">is all this is the thought about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.780" end="01:07:23.670" style="s2">gods about the divine about the sacred</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.910" end="01:07:26.490" style="s2">about revelation or eschatology the end</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.670" end="01:07:29.480" style="s2">of times the beginning of times and he</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.490" end="01:07:31.890" style="s2">says again this is part of his</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.480" end="01:07:34.380" style="s2">disciplinary worldview like he says</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.890" end="01:07:38.040" style="s2">theology should be a hundred times more</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.380" end="01:07:39.740" style="s2">important than economics and and law you</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.040" end="01:07:43.290" style="s2">see it as should these other disciplines</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.740" end="01:07:45.630" style="s2">but Heidegger is the is the center of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.290" end="01:07:48.300" style="s2">all of this because after all dougen i</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.630" end="01:07:49.650" style="s2">say my characterization not too</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.300" end="01:07:51.780" style="s2">misleading i believe he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.650" end="01:07:54.630" style="s2">philosophical supremacist okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.780" end="01:07:56.040" style="s2">not only do ghen I think Strauss and</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.630" end="01:07:57.930" style="s2">Heidegger are also philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.040" end="01:07:59.400" style="s2">supremacists and it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.930" end="01:08:00.990" style="s2">wonder how you could be a philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.400" end="01:08:03.930" style="s2">supremacist and still have these very</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.990" end="01:08:06.240" style="s2">divergent positions but for Dugan the</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.930" end="01:08:07.860" style="s2">philosophy is the highest human activity</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.240" end="01:08:10.070" style="s2">in the philosophers in a way the highest</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.860" end="01:08:12.690" style="s2">human type so he couldn&#39;t leave it at</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.070" end="01:08:14.850" style="s2">geopolitics atma sociology and theology</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.690" end="01:08:17.130" style="s2">so therefore Heidegger is the radical</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.850" end="01:08:19.650" style="s2">center of all of that and somehow he</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.130" end="01:08:21.759" style="s2">tries to correlate geopolitics</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.650" end="01:08:24.130" style="s2">to a heidegger&#39;s thinking you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.759" end="01:08:25.900" style="s2">cultural civilizational studies to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.130" end="01:08:28.809" style="s2">resources of Haida garyun philosophy and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.900" end="01:08:30.609" style="s2">likewise with the theology and he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.809" end="01:08:32.559" style="s2">a lot of books on on these I&#39;ve taught</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.609" end="01:08:34.960" style="s2">some of them I&#39;ve read some of them not</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.559" end="01:08:37.480" style="s2">all of them true and translated this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.960" end="01:08:40.299" style="s2">a massive project of political</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.480" end="01:08:43.210" style="s2">philosophy designed to present a well</p>

<p begin="01:09:01.589" end="01:09:06.130" style="s2">disciplinary contributions that people</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.940" end="01:09:08.230" style="s2">have made and it&#39;s this massive project</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.130" end="01:09:10.119" style="s2">needless to say he doesn&#39;t do it all by</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.230" end="01:09:12.609" style="s2">himself he leads seminars he has other</p>

<p begin="01:09:12.609" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">himself calls it sort of an open</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.319" end="01:09:18.609" style="s2">undertaking he&#39;s written that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:20.650" style="s2">want it to become a closed Dogma because</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.609" end="01:09:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s got to live with the openness of</p>

<p begin="01:09:23.440" end="01:09:26.980" style="s2">as it becomes a closed ideology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.819" end="01:09:28.989" style="s2">all dead he knows that it can become a</p>

<p begin="01:09:28.989" end="01:09:33.219" style="s2">that but it&#39;s a risk that you take when</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.089" end="01:09:34.989" style="s2">you think ghent genuinely you know that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.219" end="01:09:37.929" style="s2">that somebody else takes it and makes it</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.989" end="01:09:39.670" style="s2">into a cheap parody of a cell for some</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.670" end="01:09:46.569" style="s2">but his view of it I think is a serious</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.019" end="01:09:48.250" style="s2">top-to-bottom rigorous tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.569" end="01:09:50.199" style="s2">monumental project of political</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.250" end="01:09:52.269" style="s2">philosophy that passes through the</p>

<p begin="01:09:52.269" end="01:09:54.849" style="s2">20th century thought Heidegger so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.219" end="01:09:56.949" style="s2">the real deal</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.849" end="01:09:59.170" style="s2">from my perspective in my view which</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.949" end="01:10:01.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we have to buy every part</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.170" end="01:10:02.590" style="s2">of it or agree with every step in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.090" end="01:10:05.530" style="s2">reasoning but it&#39;s definitely not</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.590" end="01:10:07.449" style="s2">reducible to Dugan is this or Dugan is</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.530" end="01:10:09.190" style="s2">that you talked to Alex Jones therefore</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.449" end="01:10:10.360" style="s2">I won&#39;t read his book he&#39;s got a big</p>

<p begin="01:10:10.360" end="01:10:14.440" style="s2">therefore he&#39;s trying to infiltrate our</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.590" end="01:10:20.469" style="s2">institutions it&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.440" end="01:10:23.170" style="s2">and those are some of its components the</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.469" end="01:10:25.329" style="s2">historical context for this is it</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.170" end="01:10:28.599" style="s2">possible that this is a wounded</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.329" end="01:10:30.670" style="s2">intellect so the end of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.599" end="01:10:32.840" style="s2">it is the end of history people say</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.670" end="01:10:35.030" style="s2">right liberalism try I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.840" end="01:10:37.970" style="s2">over everything communism failed fascism</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.030" end="01:10:41.290" style="s2">Nazism was defeated and you&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.970" end="01:10:44.030" style="s2">Russia who&#39;s not a liberal society I</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.290" end="01:10:46.940" style="s2">think you&#39;re either faced with accepting</p>

<p begin="01:10:46.940" end="01:10:51.890" style="s2">ideas of culture and society or left</p>

<p begin="01:10:51.890" end="01:10:58.070" style="s2">so is this this is like a reaction to</p>

<p begin="01:10:59.810" end="01:11:05.990" style="s2">yes and no so no because there were</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.770" end="01:11:08.930" style="s2">alternatives there were other parties at</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.990" end="01:11:11.030" style="s2">the time that were not liberal like in</p>

<p begin="01:11:11.030" end="01:11:17.060" style="s2">nationalists and others but actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.250" end="01:11:19.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a total it is wounded intellect in</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.060" end="01:11:21.710" style="s2">the sense that he looked at the Soviet</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.430" end="01:11:25.430" style="s2">society he looked at the Soviet ideology</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.710" end="01:11:27.590" style="s2">he looked at around even in the 90s to</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.430" end="01:11:30.560" style="s2">see some of the alternatives and all of</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.590" end="01:11:32.390" style="s2">it became sort of a bankrupt for him but</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.560" end="01:11:34.880" style="s2">here&#39;s the question what happens</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.390" end="01:11:35.930" style="s2">existentially to us when we have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:38.120" style="s2">wounded intellect</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.930" end="01:11:40.040" style="s2">that&#39;s wounded so deeply that basically</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.120" end="01:11:42.080" style="s2">it stands naked before itself for the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.040" end="01:11:43.820" style="s2">first time when it looks around and all</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.080" end="01:11:46.700" style="s2">the scales have fallen from its eyes or</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.820" end="01:11:48.440" style="s2">when it&#39;s become deeply disillusioned so</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.700" end="01:11:49.910" style="s2">the fact that if we say it if we</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.440" end="01:11:52.340" style="s2">interpret his experience as a wounded</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.910" end="01:11:54.170" style="s2">intellect we say that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.340" end="01:11:55.880" style="s2">moment when in a sense it&#39;s the moment</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.170" end="01:11:57.830" style="s2">when you can see most clearly and when</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.880" end="01:12:01.520" style="s2">you can see most profoundly when you</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.830" end="01:12:03.170" style="s2">have that when suddenly everything that</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:04.970" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with and everything that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.170" end="01:12:07.130" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken for granted has lost its</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.970" end="01:12:09.290" style="s2">meaning for you Heidegger analyzes that</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.130" end="01:12:11.600" style="s2">he says when we&#39;re usually in the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.290" end="01:12:14.030" style="s2">with things with beings drinking coffee</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.600" end="01:12:16.460" style="s2">doing this doing that but at some point</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.030" end="01:12:18.860" style="s2">we enter this exit we we can have this</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.460" end="01:12:20.900" style="s2">existential moment where everything has</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.860" end="01:12:23.660" style="s2">become meaningless for us and that</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.900" end="01:12:25.280" style="s2">throws us back on ourselves and actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.660" end="01:12:27.800" style="s2">gives us access to ourselves for the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.280" end="01:12:29.750" style="s2">first time in a genuine way so I would</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.800" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">say in a sense and he he doesn&#39;t say</p>

<p begin="01:15:47.489" end="01:15:55.860" style="s2">to me is like a process not an end goal</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.250" end="01:15:58.469" style="s2">whereas I kind of felt like communism</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.860" end="01:16:01.020" style="s2">and fascism Nazism is is an end goal</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.469" end="01:16:03.810" style="s2">rather than a process liberalism seemed</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.020" end="01:16:05.580" style="s2">to be a system to find truth</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.810" end="01:16:08.699" style="s2">whereas communism told you what the</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.699" end="01:16:14.130" style="s2">but is the fourth this fourth political</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.460" end="01:16:18.030" style="s2">theory is this a is this a system for</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.130" end="01:16:19.650" style="s2">finding truth or is it the truth and is</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.030" end="01:16:22.260" style="s2">that a meaningful difference is that a</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.650" end="01:16:23.310" style="s2">distinction worth identifying or you</p>

<p begin="01:16:26.400" end="01:16:29.790" style="s2">see where they go yes so there are a set</p>

<p begin="01:16:29.790" end="01:16:35.489" style="s2">set of shared beliefs or of dogmas that</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.239" end="01:16:37.469" style="s2">a simple adherent of the fourth</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.489" end="01:16:39.239" style="s2">political theory would have so in that</p>

<p begin="01:17:40.829" end="01:17:44.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not a like there are political</p>

<p begin="01:17:50.519" end="01:17:55.019" style="s2">there&#39;s basically what we agreed to and</p>

<p begin="01:17:59.159" end="01:18:03.780" style="s2">a good discussion there so this idea</p>

<p begin="01:18:09.659" end="01:18:14.480" style="s2">Duggan&#39;s view instantly also not</p>

<p begin="01:18:43.800" end="01:18:49.440" style="s2">and my coffee is warm so my sentence</p>

<p begin="01:20:39.270" end="01:20:42.710" style="s2">door begins to close and close and close</p>

<p begin="01:21:12.180" end="01:21:16.440" style="s2">opened with the pre Platonic s-- there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:21:20.190" end="01:21:23.760" style="s2">taken the lights and put the back at</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.360" end="01:21:25.860" style="s2">storage in modern nihilism you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.760" end="01:21:28.140" style="s2">modern technological nihilism so the</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.860" end="01:21:29.700" style="s2">question is can we open the door again</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.140" end="01:21:30.960" style="s2">and we don&#39;t it&#39;s almost like we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:21:30.960" end="01:21:35.190" style="s2">is the lights though there is something</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.210" end="01:21:36.360" style="s2">else there we don&#39;t know because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.190" end="01:21:38.580" style="s2">not been we don&#39;t even know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.360" end="01:21:39.110" style="s2">door there anymore it&#39;s been so long</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.580" end="01:21:41.630" style="s2">since we</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.110" end="01:21:43.580" style="s2">to open it so the in some sense all of</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.630" end="01:21:45.920" style="s2">these thinkers their job is to remind us</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.580" end="01:21:47.719" style="s2">hey guys there&#39;s something over there</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.920" end="01:21:49.820" style="s2">let&#39;s go have a look let&#39;s knock let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.719" end="01:21:51.920" style="s2">feel it out if it&#39;s locked let&#39;s find</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.820" end="01:21:53.780" style="s2">the key as some of them click say they</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.920" end="01:21:55.369" style="s2">opened it we don&#39;t know for sure right</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.780" end="01:21:56.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve got for now we have to walk for</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.369" end="01:21:59.600" style="s2">now we don&#39;t even know there&#39;s a door</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.750" end="01:22:00.679" style="s2">so truth is something with the history</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.600" end="01:22:02.420" style="s2">truth is something that has a</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.679" end="01:22:05.570" style="s2">development but what does that even mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.420" end="01:22:08.330" style="s2">so this is all an undiscovered uncharted</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.570" end="01:22:12.639" style="s2">territory I think you know it&#39;s uh but</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.330" end="01:22:16.070" style="s2">it&#39;s in my view it&#39;s where eventually</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.639" end="01:22:19.100" style="s2">thoughtful figures will need to turn</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.070" end="01:22:23.150" style="s2">because the question of human being of</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.100" end="01:22:25.699" style="s2">being of truth of history all of this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.150" end="01:22:27.500" style="s2">at this somehow whether we know it or</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.699" end="01:22:30.800" style="s2">not at the center of the ground that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.500" end="01:22:32.300" style="s2">shaking beneath our feet somehow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.800" end="01:22:34.760" style="s2">almost like there&#39;s a knock from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.300" end="01:22:37.310" style="s2">other side of the door you know and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:22:39.350" end="01:22:44.540" style="s2">interpreting all that we know is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.840" end="01:22:47.719" style="s2">something calling us to see that the</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.540" end="01:22:49.070" style="s2">light has gone out and to me that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.719" end="01:22:50.150" style="s2">whole drama in the whole mystery of</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.070" end="01:22:52.670" style="s2">where things stand right now</p>

<p begin="01:24:48.920" end="01:24:52.250" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying anybody should go and</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.300" end="01:24:54.350" style="s2">work through all 24 volumes they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.250" end="01:24:57.050" style="s2">even in English yet but yeah so many</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.350" end="01:24:59.030" style="s2">civilizations and in no case can you</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.050" end="01:25:00.800" style="s2">assume that you&#39;ve really understood</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.030" end="01:25:03.530" style="s2">them from your own point of view so</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.800" end="01:25:06.650" style="s2">basically he&#39;s saying look let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.530" end="01:25:10.960" style="s2">basic example if a Russian person wants</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.650" end="01:25:13.760" style="s2">to know the West he can&#39;t just assume</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.960" end="01:25:15.710" style="s2">the West is worse than Russia or the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.760" end="01:25:17.690" style="s2">West is better than Russia where the</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.710" end="01:25:19.490" style="s2">West is equivalent to Madonna and</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.690" end="01:25:21.050" style="s2">McDonald&#39;s or whatever you know back in</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.490" end="01:25:22.640" style="s2">the 90s maybe that reference is more</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.050" end="01:25:24.860" style="s2">appropriate it&#39;s like you actually have</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.640" end="01:25:27.620" style="s2">to go and study the poets and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.860" end="01:25:29.390" style="s2">philosophers and the and the writers and</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.620" end="01:25:31.700" style="s2">you have in sort of in that case you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.390" end="01:25:33.920" style="s2">get to know the American cultural soul</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.700" end="01:25:38.570" style="s2">so to speak and same thing if you want</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.920" end="01:25:40.910" style="s2">to go study some Spain or Brazil and all</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.570" end="01:25:42.710" style="s2">of these are multifaceted I said in my</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.910" end="01:25:44.030" style="s2">interview back in the day one of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.710" end="01:25:45.920" style="s2">phrases that got me in trouble but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.030" end="01:25:47.990" style="s2">as true today as it was then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.920" end="01:25:50.690" style="s2">pointing to a blossoming complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.990" end="01:25:53.210" style="s2">human existence so cultural and</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.690" end="01:25:54.710" style="s2">civilizational multipolarity it reflects</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.210" end="01:25:57.650" style="s2">the blossoming complexity of human</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.710" end="01:26:01.550" style="s2">existence it&#39;s its languages its songs</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.650" end="01:26:03.110" style="s2">its dances and also as I say the deeper</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.550" end="01:26:05.390" style="s2">dimension how it how it thinks about</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.110" end="01:26:06.639" style="s2">time how it thinks about God how things</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.390" end="01:26:10.630" style="s2">about history I&#39;ll think so</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.639" end="01:26:12.280" style="s2">and he says we shouldn&#39;t reduce we</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.630" end="01:26:14.980" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t take any one of them as the</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.280" end="01:26:18.000" style="s2">standard for all the others of them it</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.980" end="01:26:20.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that somebody who is just</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.000" end="01:26:23.739" style="s2">like let me give you this example from</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.350" end="01:26:24.130" style="s2">Strauss so Strauss said culture used to</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.739" end="01:26:26.469" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.130" end="01:26:28.540" style="s2">cultivation like the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.469" end="01:26:30.250" style="s2">nature I have a garden I have some</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.540" end="01:26:32.260" style="s2">flowers I&#39;m cultivating them so that</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.250" end="01:26:34.780" style="s2">they grow but people have started to</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.260" end="01:26:36.610" style="s2">talk about culture like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.780" end="01:26:39.520" style="s2">culture of prisoners there&#39;s a culture</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.610" end="01:26:41.260" style="s2">of gangs there&#39;s a culture of rapists so</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.520" end="01:26:43.389" style="s2">a culture got away from the sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.260" end="01:26:45.850" style="s2">cultivation of human nature and started</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.389" end="01:26:48.909" style="s2">to mean just any set of ordered activity</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.850" end="01:26:50.380" style="s2">and cirrhosis view was like now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.909" end="01:26:52.570" style="s2">kind of like we&#39;ve littered our garden</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.380" end="01:26:54.250" style="s2">with cigarette butts and you know Peter</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.570" end="01:26:55.929" style="s2">pissed on it we don&#39;t even care so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.250" end="01:26:59.080" style="s2">moved away from the actual notion of</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.929" end="01:27:00.909" style="s2">genuine cultivation so Duggan&#39;s view is</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.080" end="01:27:03.580" style="s2">not that you know the cigarette butts</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.909" end="01:27:05.770" style="s2">and the public urination is as equally</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.580" end="01:27:08.469" style="s2">worthy as the philosophical life or of</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.770" end="01:27:10.630" style="s2">poetry it&#39;s just that there are many</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.469" end="01:27:12.580" style="s2">Gardens and there are many flowers that</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.630" end="01:27:15.760" style="s2">are growing in those gardens and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.580" end="01:27:18.070" style="s2">where he wants to turn his attention and</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.760" end="01:27:19.570" style="s2">is he thinks that should be reflected</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.070" end="01:27:21.940" style="s2">politically to a certain extent in a</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.570" end="01:27:23.560" style="s2">multipolar world and philosophically by</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.940" end="01:27:26.590" style="s2">you know the correct study of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.560" end="01:27:30.070" style="s2">alternatives so this is a great point</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.590" end="01:27:32.889" style="s2">something to really talk about one is it</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.070" end="01:27:36.940" style="s2">does liberal of the liberalism account</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.889" end="01:27:38.170" style="s2">for a civilizational plurality one and</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.940" end="01:27:40.360" style="s2">then two</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.170" end="01:27:43.110" style="s2">does it account for a multipolar world</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.360" end="01:27:45.969" style="s2">that reflects these civilizational</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.110" end="01:27:47.969" style="s2">polarities and three to what extent is</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.969" end="01:27:50.469" style="s2">this notion of multipolarity</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.969" end="01:27:53.170" style="s2">civilizational ii really feeding the</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.469" end="01:27:56.380" style="s2">geopolitical view and i think is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.170" end="01:27:58.060" style="s2">really getting in people&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.380" end="01:28:00.580" style="s2">MER and people saddle when they start</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.060" end="01:28:02.020" style="s2">hearing about multipolar world because</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.580" end="01:28:04.659" style="s2">from the United States perspective</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.020" end="01:28:06.280" style="s2">that&#39;s not exactly what we have or what</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.659" end="01:28:09.630" style="s2">we want or what we see for the future</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.280" end="01:28:11.860" style="s2">right yeah so generally speaking liberal</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.630" end="01:28:13.480" style="s2">political doctrine or liberal political</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.860" end="01:28:16.349" style="s2">philosophy or just liberal thinking</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.480" end="01:28:19.389" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really acknowledge plurality</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.349" end="01:28:20.140" style="s2">cultural civilizational plurality in a</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.389" end="01:28:23.080" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.140" end="01:28:25.870" style="s2">full you know in an adequate way so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.080" end="01:28:29.470" style="s2">not just that it denies the Worth and</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.870" end="01:28:31.080" style="s2">value the unique Worth and value you</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.470" end="01:28:33.520" style="s2">know of other cultures and civilizations</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.080" end="01:28:35.410" style="s2">it recognizes them the same way it</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.520" end="01:28:37.630" style="s2">recognizes the individual dignity of</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.410" end="01:28:39.400" style="s2">individuals but it doesn&#39;t recognize</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.630" end="01:28:42.100" style="s2">them in their own self understanding</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.400" end="01:28:46.030" style="s2">self interpretation and self estimation</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.100" end="01:28:48.610" style="s2">I would say that&#39;s it&#39;s a rejection of</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.030" end="01:28:50.680" style="s2">plurality in space but it also in a way</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.610" end="01:28:52.630" style="s2">rejects I mean this is a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.680" end="01:28:55.900" style="s2">Strauss&#39;s point to a certain extent that</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.630" end="01:28:57.400" style="s2">the liberal mind also doesn&#39;t grant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.900" end="01:29:00.580" style="s2">also very high-minded</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.400" end="01:29:03.190" style="s2">and how would you put a demeaning of</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.580" end="01:29:05.350" style="s2">previous times so it also looks at past</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.190" end="01:29:08.020" style="s2">times as not really worth they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.350" end="01:29:09.670" style="s2">you know they&#39;re pre-modern they just</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.020" end="01:29:11.050" style="s2">are not yet what we are now and</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.670" end="01:29:11.500" style="s2">therefore are not really worth our full</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.050" end="01:29:13.420" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.500" end="01:29:15.130" style="s2">that&#39;s the temporal aspect or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.420" end="01:29:17.320" style="s2">underdeveloped you know they just</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.130" end="01:29:20.200" style="s2">haven&#39;t gotten as far today you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.320" end="01:29:22.600" style="s2">here and now as we are here now so the</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.200" end="01:29:24.640" style="s2">it takes itself as the standard in space</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.600" end="01:29:26.560" style="s2">and in time so in that sense liberal</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.640" end="01:29:28.740" style="s2">world is not really pluralistic in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.560" end="01:29:32.020" style="s2">deep sense of acknowledging the Worth</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.740" end="01:29:32.800" style="s2">and uniqueness of the other cultures and</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.020" end="01:29:34.990" style="s2">civilizations</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.800" end="01:29:38.290" style="s2">it also accordingly you know doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.990" end="01:29:40.330" style="s2">really respect a multipolar world so</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.290" end="01:29:42.160" style="s2">Dugan had an analyze this and he says</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.330" end="01:29:44.380" style="s2">the west can do like multilateral</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.160" end="01:29:46.030" style="s2">approaches where other governments</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.380" end="01:29:48.100" style="s2">together with the United States will</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.030" end="01:29:50.470" style="s2">pursue a certain policy so it can work</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.100" end="01:29:53.320" style="s2">together with other states other blocks</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.470" end="01:29:56.230" style="s2">and other forces but without really</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.320" end="01:29:59.380" style="s2">caring about or you know cherishing</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.230" end="01:30:01.690" style="s2">their distinct cultural identity and</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.380" end="01:30:03.670" style="s2">also obviously any power wants to</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.690" end="01:30:05.080" style="s2">preserve its power and seize the rise of</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.670" end="01:30:06.910" style="s2">other powers as a threat and as a</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.080" end="01:30:08.950" style="s2">problem whether you dress it up as</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.910" end="01:30:10.360" style="s2">blossom in complexity or not it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.950" end="01:30:12.190" style="s2">matter right you don&#39;t want to give up</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.360" end="01:30:14.290" style="s2">your hegemony you don&#39;t want to give up</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.190" end="01:30:15.850" style="s2">your power you don&#39;t want to cede the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.290" end="01:30:18.510" style="s2">momentum all of that is totally</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.850" end="01:30:22.600" style="s2">understandable obviously and is</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.510" end="01:30:24.010" style="s2">justified to a certain extent and also</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.600" end="01:30:26.980" style="s2">well defended by other political</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.010" end="01:30:28.510" style="s2">theorists in our tradition but still you</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.980" end="01:30:30.250" style="s2">asked right there&#39;s the liberal world</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.510" end="01:30:32.500" style="s2">sort of have an embrace of multipolarity</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.250" end="01:30:33.909" style="s2">the answer&#39;s no although to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.500" end="01:30:36.729" style="s2">extent with Trump</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.909" end="01:30:38.590" style="s2">that that changed to a certain extent he</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.729" end="01:30:40.780" style="s2">gave speeches now this is not my main</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.590" end="01:30:42.249" style="s2">area of expertise but he gave speeches</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.780" end="01:30:44.229" style="s2">in defense of national</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.249" end="01:30:45.820" style="s2">self-determination and cultural</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.229" end="01:30:48.159" style="s2">self-determination in Poland and</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.820" end="01:30:50.079" style="s2">elsewhere and there were figures like</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.159" end="01:30:52.150" style="s2">Ernesto Russo if I said that correctly</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.079" end="01:30:54.070" style="s2">in Brazil who took that and wrote about</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.150" end="01:30:55.959" style="s2">it and made a big deal out of it</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.070" end="01:31:00.070" style="s2">so that marked a break you know what the</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.959" end="01:31:02.739" style="s2">past approaches but definitely it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.070" end="01:31:05.679" style="s2">inherent to liberalism in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.739" end="01:31:07.599" style="s2">it is to let&#39;s say eurasianism to give a</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.679" end="01:31:10.659" style="s2">name to do against ideology and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.599" end="01:31:14.380" style="s2">Russian outfit to acknowledge these</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.659" end="01:31:16.119" style="s2">differences so multipolarity is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.380" end="01:31:17.919" style="s2">like an official doctrine for Russia</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.119" end="01:31:19.209" style="s2">there shouldn&#39;t be just one poll in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.919" end="01:31:20.650" style="s2">world but again that&#39;s obvious enough</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.209" end="01:31:22.539" style="s2">right we don&#39;t want the United States to</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.650" end="01:31:25.030" style="s2">be the sole dominating force in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.539" end="01:31:26.409" style="s2">world and on the other hand for the from</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.030" end="01:31:27.969" style="s2">the United States not to want there to</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.409" end="01:31:30.459" style="s2">be other competitors so all of that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.969" end="01:31:32.260" style="s2">very natural but still it you have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.459" end="01:31:34.570" style="s2">raise the question on what basis is</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.260" end="01:31:35.409" style="s2">there going to be the assertion of</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.570" end="01:31:38.079" style="s2">multipolarity</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.409" end="01:31:39.939" style="s2">is it just the power struggle does it</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.079" end="01:31:41.590" style="s2">reflect something else right is the</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.939" end="01:31:44.380" style="s2">theory just addressing of the power</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.590" end="01:31:46.900" style="s2">games or do the power problems arise</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.380" end="01:31:48.999" style="s2">because they grow out of the theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.900" end="01:31:51.219" style="s2">problems you know so there&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.999" end="01:31:53.199" style="s2">both of that I would say but if Dugan</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.219" end="01:31:55.900" style="s2">didn&#39;t have volume after volume after</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.199" end="01:31:57.340" style="s2">volume of genuinely theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.900" end="01:31:59.039" style="s2">philosophical work it would be very easy</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.340" end="01:32:05.139" style="s2">to say these are all just power games</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.039" end="01:32:08.010" style="s2">but more often than not the the thinking</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.139" end="01:32:11.099" style="s2">comes first and then the power relations</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.010" end="01:32:14.619" style="s2">arise from within what has been</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.099" end="01:32:16.059" style="s2">configured in thought you see so if you</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.619" end="01:32:17.590" style="s2">go to Heidegger and if you combine them</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.059" end="01:32:20.380" style="s2">with these other things and you have</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.590" end="01:32:21.610" style="s2">cultural uniqueness and distinction then</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.380" end="01:32:23.229" style="s2">you have this whole question of</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.610" end="01:32:24.999" style="s2">multipolarity so Duggan&#39;s been fighting</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.229" end="01:32:27.959" style="s2">for it politically by trying to make a</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.999" end="01:32:30.760" style="s2">block various blocks and geopolitical</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.959" end="01:32:32.639" style="s2">allies for russia he&#39;s been trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.760" end="01:32:35.169" style="s2">it domestically and in international</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.639" end="01:32:37.539" style="s2">politics but again I argue that that</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.169" end="01:32:39.909" style="s2">reflects his deeper world world view</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.539" end="01:32:42.309" style="s2">it&#39;s like again the geopolitics in his</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.909" end="01:32:43.929" style="s2">model on his own account for what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.309" end="01:32:45.610" style="s2">worth we don&#39;t have to accept it but on</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.929" end="01:32:47.150" style="s2">his own account we should at least take</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.610" end="01:32:50.270" style="s2">it as a starting</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.150" end="01:32:51.949" style="s2">point geopolitics is the body right of</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.270" end="01:32:53.750" style="s2">is the body of the discipline ethno</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.949" end="01:32:55.489" style="s2">sociology to solve theology to spirit</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.750" end="01:32:57.380" style="s2">and Heidegger the center of all of these</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.489" end="01:32:59.960" style="s2">things so in a way it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.380" end="01:33:03.500" style="s2">body is not important but the body is</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.960" end="01:33:05.600" style="s2">just one component and it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.500" end="01:33:06.890" style="s2">body is more important than the soul you</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.600" end="01:33:08.420" style="s2">know if anything the soul is more</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.890" end="01:33:10.100" style="s2">important in the body so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.420" end="01:33:11.929" style="s2">geopolitics there&#39;s a defensive</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.100" end="01:33:14.989" style="s2">multipolarity but it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.929" end="01:33:20.570" style="s2">reflect what he thinks is the truth</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.989" end="01:33:24.140" style="s2">about civilizational plurality Russia is</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.570" end="01:33:27.020" style="s2">a really big place right and Soviet</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.140" end="01:33:30.469" style="s2">Union spanned a number of different</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.020" end="01:33:32.570" style="s2">areas Europe Asia I remember in college</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.469" end="01:33:34.699" style="s2">I used to date girls the Russian girls</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.570" end="01:33:36.920" style="s2">in some way someone look another way</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.699" end="01:33:39.199" style="s2">than I dated a Kazakh girl you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.920" end="01:33:40.850" style="s2">there&#39;s like a whole tremendous variety</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.199" end="01:33:43.400" style="s2">of people that were within the the</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.850" end="01:33:45.469" style="s2">Soviet bloc and and living within Russia</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.400" end="01:33:49.219" style="s2">Russia&#39;s massive place right it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.469" end="01:33:52.909" style="s2">Europe both Asia to what extent is is</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.219" end="01:33:55.219" style="s2">that that experience bubbling up through</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.909" end="01:33:57.530" style="s2">these ideas right because it has to sort</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.219" end="01:34:00.679" style="s2">of if it doesn&#39;t take into account the</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.530" end="01:34:03.140" style="s2">natural phenomenon of multi-ethnic in a</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.679" end="01:34:04.820" style="s2">way and and multipolar world then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.140" end="01:34:06.380" style="s2">sort of just discounting its own</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.820" end="01:34:08.060" style="s2">existence and its own yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.380" end="01:34:11.719" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.060" end="01:34:13.550" style="s2">experience of of the many groups there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.719" end="01:34:17.060" style="s2">also the experience of having lived in</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.550" end="01:34:20.000" style="s2">the Soviet Union so you have the idea</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.060" end="01:34:21.679" style="s2">not just of non politically organized</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.000" end="01:34:24.050" style="s2">groups but also politically organized</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.679" end="01:34:26.330" style="s2">groups and of a union or an empire that</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.050" end="01:34:27.949" style="s2">embraces them all as well as the history</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.330" end="01:34:30.860" style="s2">of the collapse of the Soviet Union into</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.949" end="01:34:33.140" style="s2">the Russian Federation as a smaller and</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.860" end="01:34:34.520" style="s2">distinct form of government so all of</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.140" end="01:34:35.840" style="s2">that is therefore dougen and is thinking</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.520" end="01:34:39.920" style="s2">about political life and political</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.840" end="01:34:41.270" style="s2">reality no doubt and it&#39;s easier for him</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.920" end="01:34:44.480" style="s2">to put his finger on these types of</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.270" end="01:34:47.659" style="s2">things than it is in a just a stable</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.480" end="01:34:49.880" style="s2">long lasting Civic nationalist country</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.659" end="01:34:53.179" style="s2">where you haven&#39;t had components of</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.880" end="01:34:55.670" style="s2">crisis you haven&#39;t had the same moments</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.179" end="01:34:57.620" style="s2">of crisis and the same thing is coming</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.670" end="01:34:59.690" style="s2">to the surface as you said so for sure</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.620" end="01:35:01.100" style="s2">all of that factors into his</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.690" end="01:35:03.460" style="s2">into his thinking and into his</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.100" end="01:35:05.660" style="s2">theorizing hmm</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.460" end="01:35:07.190" style="s2">fascinating one of the second things</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.660" end="01:35:09.350" style="s2">that I wrote down here was reject</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.190" end="01:35:11.420" style="s2">natural thinking what did I write that</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.350" end="01:35:12.860" style="s2">down right or is that could you explain</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.420" end="01:35:15.199" style="s2">that this was this was right after</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.860" end="01:35:16.820" style="s2">acknowledging many civilizations and</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.199" end="01:35:18.170" style="s2">right before accepting the divinity of</p>

<p begin="01:35:18.170" end="01:35:23.170" style="s2">rejecting natural thinking did I did I</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.050" end="01:35:26.060" style="s2">get that money if said rejecting the</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.170" end="01:35:28.670" style="s2">natural science so the idea that natural</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.060" end="01:35:31.760" style="s2">that scientific study of objective</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.670" end="01:35:34.310" style="s2">reality is the standard for human</p>

<p begin="01:35:34.310" end="01:35:41.420" style="s2">perfection that basically our task is</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.949" end="01:35:45.070" style="s2">not scientific knowledge of reality and</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.420" end="01:35:47.420" style="s2">the use of what we discover in</p>

<p begin="01:35:54.380" end="01:35:59.000" style="s2">that is basically usually considered to</p>

<p begin="01:35:59.000" end="01:36:03.199" style="s2">scientific conquest of nature as the</p>

<p begin="01:36:03.199" end="01:36:06.710" style="s2">we live better when we put the products</p>

<p begin="01:36:06.710" end="01:36:11.630" style="s2">but that print that privileges in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.840" end="01:36:16.040" style="s2">sense scientific consciousness over the</p>

<p begin="01:36:24.920" end="01:36:31.130" style="s2">can only say that there was a group of</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.550" end="01:36:33.710" style="s2">thinkers huh Cyril Heidegger and others</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.130" end="01:36:37.640" style="s2">phenomenological thinkers who said we</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.710" end="01:36:41.030" style="s2">can look at pre scientific not primitive</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.640" end="01:36:44.810" style="s2">culture society you know X amount of</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.030" end="01:36:47.060" style="s2">years ago but in us ourselves what is</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.810" end="01:36:49.610" style="s2">the pre scientific mode of our own</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.060" end="01:36:51.860" style="s2">thinking and consciousness in what sense</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.610" end="01:36:54.440" style="s2">is scientific thought a modification of</p>

<p begin="01:36:54.440" end="01:36:59.060" style="s2">again not in time we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.449" end="01:37:01.550" style="s2">about some cave men here we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.060" end="01:37:04.310" style="s2">how is our consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.550" end="01:37:06.440" style="s2">constituted in relation to scientific</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.310" end="01:37:07.969" style="s2">knowledge and scientific modes of</p>

<p begin="01:37:09.800" end="01:37:13.560" style="s2">it studied consciousness in ourselves</p>

<p begin="01:37:21.000" end="01:37:27.000" style="s2">view here is not to take the scientific</p>

<p begin="01:37:42.000" end="01:37:45.690" style="s2">because I call Dugan a philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.620" end="01:37:49.470" style="s2">supremacist he does take intellect in</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.690" end="01:37:51.180" style="s2">some sense as supreme but he doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:38:12.240" end="01:38:16.530" style="s2">am I remembering my Aristotle right when</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.160" end="01:38:18.090" style="s2">he says that the political like</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.530" end="01:38:19.710" style="s2">political thinking political thought is</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.090" end="01:38:22.110" style="s2">at the top of the mountain that that is</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.710" end="01:38:24.150" style="s2">the highest pursuit the best pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.110" end="01:38:25.740" style="s2">yeah I should bring you the most utility</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.150" end="01:38:27.390" style="s2">and happiness and knowledge yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.740" end="01:38:28.860" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the peaks of one of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.390" end="01:38:30.330" style="s2">mountains but it&#39;s definitely a peak of</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.860" end="01:38:32.850" style="s2">a mountain there&#39;s a question there of</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.330" end="01:38:34.380" style="s2">there&#39;s an age-old question of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.850" end="01:38:36.330" style="s2">primacy of the political life to the</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.380" end="01:38:39.210" style="s2">philosophical life and whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.330" end="01:38:40.290" style="s2">you need the peak of the political life</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.210" end="01:38:42.180" style="s2">to experience the peak of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.290" end="01:38:45.120" style="s2">philosophical life but no doubt</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.180" end="01:38:47.310" style="s2">reflection on politics on ethics on law</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.120" end="01:38:49.170" style="s2">on community on the law giver on the</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.310" end="01:38:50.760" style="s2">virtues excellence justice and</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.170" end="01:38:53.790" style="s2">everything that is at the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.760" end="01:38:57.620" style="s2">political life no doubt is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.790" end="01:39:00.870" style="s2">two peaks if there are two in Aristotle</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.620" end="01:39:02.730" style="s2">got it and so the third element here is</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.870" end="01:39:03.990" style="s2">accepting the divinity of love human</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.730" end="01:39:06.540" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.990" end="01:39:08.520" style="s2">reserve is that bringing in necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.540" end="01:39:10.560" style="s2">concept of spirituality and religion</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.520" end="01:39:13.560" style="s2">into this fourth political pork</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.560" end="01:39:18.540" style="s2">political theory no and I would say if</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.560" end="01:39:20.360" style="s2">you get it yeah so there is okay he puts</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.540" end="01:39:23.580" style="s2">it like this he says if we reject</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.360" end="01:39:27.030" style="s2">liberalism communism fascism we make</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.580" end="01:39:29.539" style="s2">available the things that they rejected</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.030" end="01:39:33.510" style="s2">one of the things that they rejected is</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.539" end="01:39:35.280" style="s2">rkx traditionalism revelation divinity</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.510" end="01:39:37.050" style="s2">they had maybe each of them had their</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.280" end="01:39:40.170" style="s2">own watered-down version or somehow</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.050" end="01:39:41.460" style="s2">narrow version but the whole resort all</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.170" end="01:39:43.679" style="s2">of the resources of mythological</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.460" end="01:39:47.869" style="s2">thinking again traditional thinking</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.679" end="01:39:47.869" style="s2">religious thinking and it need not be</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.079" end="01:39:53.369" style="s2">religious rationalism deism</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.750" end="01:39:56.070" style="s2">Protestantism suddenly it puts on the</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.369" end="01:39:59.309" style="s2">table again doesn&#39;t force-feed this but</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.070" end="01:40:03.480" style="s2">it puts it on the table all forms of</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.309" end="01:40:07.860" style="s2">mysticism Gnosticism hermeticism magic</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.480" end="01:40:11.460" style="s2">okay all the mechanisms and modalities</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.860" end="01:40:14.070" style="s2">of religious thought that may have been</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.460" end="01:40:16.199" style="s2">in the underground in modernity if not</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.070" end="01:40:18.239" style="s2">completely rejected so first of all</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.199" end="01:40:20.400" style="s2">those become available for our study and</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.239" end="01:40:22.500" style="s2">reconsideration and Dugan has a book in</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.400" end="01:40:25.139" style="s2">search of the dark logos where he looks</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.500" end="01:40:27.960" style="s2">at Gnosticism hermeticism cabbalistic</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.139" end="01:40:30.000" style="s2">thinking alchemy and these other things</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.960" end="01:40:32.849" style="s2">that for liberal rationalism would</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.000" end="01:40:34.980" style="s2">definitely be just definitely crackpot</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.849" end="01:40:38.010" style="s2">domain right you do not take that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.980" end="01:40:39.900" style="s2">seriously even if you&#39;re even aware of</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.010" end="01:40:43.139" style="s2">its existence so that&#39;s number one he</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.900" end="01:40:45.960" style="s2">puts it on the table but it&#39;s not but</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.139" end="01:40:48.090" style="s2">it&#39;s also not jumping to theology and</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.960" end="01:40:49.949" style="s2">divinity right away because again there</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.090" end="01:40:52.139" style="s2">- what is the soul right all they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.949" end="01:40:54.630" style="s2">open questions in a sense the simple it</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.139" end="01:40:56.789" style="s2">for a Russian Duga nest the simplest</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.630" end="01:40:59.820" style="s2">thing is to just say I mean identify</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.789" end="01:41:02.730" style="s2">with my traditional religious identity</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.820" end="01:41:04.590" style="s2">Russian orthodoxy and there you go so</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.730" end="01:41:05.940" style="s2">Russia is distinct from the West because</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.590" end="01:41:08.550" style="s2">the West is Protestantism and</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.940" end="01:41:10.530" style="s2">Catholicism and we&#39;re Eastern Orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.550" end="01:41:12.480" style="s2">end of story</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.530" end="01:41:15.210" style="s2">I&#39;m Russian Orthodox there you go that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.480" end="01:41:17.880" style="s2">my cultural distinction but and dougen</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.210" end="01:41:18.840" style="s2">allows for that at one level but again</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.880" end="01:41:21.989" style="s2">as you always see there are these</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.840" end="01:41:24.030" style="s2">multiple levels so at one point he says</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.989" end="01:41:26.429" style="s2">and this is available in English in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.030" end="01:41:28.559" style="s2">book called political Platonism he says</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.429" end="01:41:30.809" style="s2">that there should be a reconsideration</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.559" end="01:41:32.309" style="s2">of the origins of Christianity and of</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.809" end="01:41:34.170" style="s2">the various schools and debates in</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.309" end="01:41:36.269" style="s2">Christianity but all of that will be</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.170" end="01:41:38.010" style="s2">proceeding blindly if it doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.269" end="01:41:38.610" style="s2">Plato and Neoplatonism because all of</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.010" end="01:41:41.100" style="s2">those really</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.610" end="01:41:43.380" style="s2">thinkers somehow you get the blueprint</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.100" end="01:41:45.450" style="s2">or the matrix of their thought in at</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.380" end="01:41:48.300" style="s2">least Plato and Neoplatonism broadly</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.450" end="01:41:49.890" style="s2">speaking so when he says III had</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.300" end="01:41:52.170" style="s2">mentioned about one of the basic views</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.890" end="01:41:55.260" style="s2">of a fourth little theory is that</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.170" end="01:41:56.970" style="s2">divinity is not rejected right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.260" end="01:41:58.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s on the table it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.970" end="01:42:01.140" style="s2">materialism it&#39;s not an atheism it</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.800" end="01:42:04.200" style="s2">somehow allows for that trans human</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.140" end="01:42:06.030" style="s2">domain domain but it ranges all the way</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.200" end="01:42:07.530" style="s2">as they say from I&#39;m just gonna declare</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.030" end="01:42:10.350" style="s2">my Russian orthodoxy to be in conformity</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.530" end="01:42:12.000" style="s2">with my cultural tradition - I now need</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.350" end="01:42:13.980" style="s2">to do the whole study of neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.000" end="01:42:15.600" style="s2">and Plato to understand what was going</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.980" end="01:42:18.020" style="s2">on with the early church fathers that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.600" end="01:42:21.210" style="s2">all fair game what&#39;s not fair game is</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.020" end="01:42:23.250" style="s2">materialism just to say there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.210" end="01:42:25.380" style="s2">but the rocks and the trees and the</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.250" end="01:42:27.660" style="s2">birds okay no other dimension but what</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.380" end="01:42:32.160" style="s2">you can see in swallow basically that is</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.660" end="01:42:35.760" style="s2">off the table I think he I should add</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.160" end="01:42:37.350" style="s2">though to the extent that there that</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.760" end="01:42:39.960" style="s2">Russia is a unique civilization this</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.350" end="01:42:43.320" style="s2">just follows from his model Russia would</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.960" end="01:42:45.180" style="s2">also have its unique materialism so even</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.320" end="01:42:48.090" style="s2">the forms of like transcendence and</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.180" end="01:42:49.560" style="s2">materialism okay they also will take on</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.090" end="01:42:51.750" style="s2">different hues somewhat from</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.560" end="01:42:53.700" style="s2">civilization to civilization so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.750" end="01:42:55.410" style="s2">rich picture but yeah it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.700" end="01:42:58.680" style="s2">everybody has to believe in God it means</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.410" end="01:43:01.950" style="s2">somehow like I said an acknowledgment of</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.680" end="01:43:07.890" style="s2">this other domain dimension or aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.950" end="01:43:10.350" style="s2">human life is sort of built in again</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.890" end="01:43:13.470" style="s2">there is a lot there it&#39;s a little off</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.350" end="01:43:15.210" style="s2">topic but I&#39;m reminded of and just been</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.470" end="01:43:18.240" style="s2">reading recently the conflict between</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.210" end="01:43:20.820" style="s2">the founding fathers in America not the</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.240" end="01:43:23.420" style="s2">conflict even but the the the symbiotic</p>

<p begin="01:43:54.450" end="01:43:58.710" style="s2">but there was a dance and an interplay</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.760" end="01:44:00.780" style="s2">between the cosmopolitan folks at the</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.710" end="01:44:03.060" style="s2">city who wanted to embrace these</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.780" end="01:44:04.560" style="s2">enlightenment and in thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.060" end="01:44:07.200" style="s2">thought and liberalism and create this</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.560" end="01:44:10.170" style="s2">new country and have the revolution but</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.200" end="01:44:12.510" style="s2">you know it was an alliance it was a</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.170" end="01:44:14.850" style="s2">dance and it&#39;s interesting to me that I</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.510" end="01:44:17.100" style="s2">have to go back and rediscover those</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.850" end="01:44:19.290" style="s2">were that relationship between the very</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.100" end="01:44:21.720" style="s2">religious groups that were on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.290" end="01:44:23.670" style="s2">at the time and you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.720" end="01:44:25.020" style="s2">separation of church and state and this</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.670" end="01:44:26.330" style="s2">whole concepts that we think of today</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.020" end="01:44:30.900" style="s2">were that the United States government</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.330" end="01:44:33.060" style="s2">isn&#39;t involved in or founded by or you</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.900" end="01:44:35.970" style="s2">know supports of religious thinking when</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.060" end="01:44:38.160" style="s2">really the whole revolution was had very</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.970" end="01:44:41.340" style="s2">serious heavy religious undertones and</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.160" end="01:44:43.380" style="s2">overtones and those things all sort of</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.340" end="01:44:46.830" style="s2">gotten lost and what&#39;s interesting for</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.380" end="01:44:48.900" style="s2">me and my personal upbringing is my</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.830" end="01:44:51.780" style="s2">mom&#39;s side the family was Catholic but</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.900" end="01:44:54.150" style="s2">she sort of was reformed she lost it and</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.780" end="01:44:56.580" style="s2">my dad&#39;s side was Jewish and I was bar</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.150" end="01:45:00.990" style="s2">Mitzvahed but then I sort of lost it and</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.580" end="01:45:02.850" style="s2">and so now I&#39;m I&#39;m I grew up without any</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.990" end="01:45:04.740" style="s2">kind of religion and without any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.850" end="01:45:06.390" style="s2">real spirituality and now I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.740" end="01:45:09.270" style="s2">taking time to actually go back and look</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.390" end="01:45:11.280" style="s2">and learn and read and understand and</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.270" end="01:45:14.970" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been developing a much greater</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.280" end="01:45:16.770" style="s2">appreciation for that&#39;s type of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.970" end="01:45:18.900" style="s2">and these processes and starting to put</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.770" end="01:45:20.370" style="s2">things into historical context you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.900" end="01:45:22.770" style="s2">like a guys guys like Plato and</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.370" end="01:45:25.140" style="s2">Aristotle what did the what do the</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.770" end="01:45:28.050" style="s2">Christian Christian scholars think about</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.140" end="01:45:30.630" style="s2">you know is is Aristotle in heaven you</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.050" end="01:45:32.820" style="s2">know he wasn&#39;t saved by Jesus right but</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.630" end="01:45:34.650" style="s2">like it seems you know the thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.820" end="01:45:36.930" style="s2">very similar and right all along the</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.650" end="01:45:39.360" style="s2">same line so it&#39;s just fascinating to me</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.930" end="01:45:41.190" style="s2">to see these questions from two and</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.360" end="01:45:44.460" style="s2">three thousand four thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.190" end="01:45:47.340" style="s2">to you know American Revolution to forth</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.460" end="01:45:51.300" style="s2">political theory all these questions</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.340" end="01:45:54.180" style="s2">still still circulate none of them</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.300" end="01:45:55.500" style="s2">necessarily answered am I right about</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.180" end="01:45:57.480" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t answered any of these</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.500" end="01:45:59.520" style="s2">questions yet well you know strokes has</p>

<p begin="01:45:59.520" end="01:46:03.409" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of the logic of return</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.890" end="01:46:05.780" style="s2">returning to the questions</p>

<p begin="01:46:23.989" end="01:46:27.919" style="s2">you know as has gone to the logic of</p>

<p begin="01:46:27.919" end="01:46:32.150" style="s2">back to what&#39;s old and outdated because</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.929" end="01:46:33.530" style="s2">these questions are always alive for us</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.150" end="01:46:36.139" style="s2">they&#39;re always living they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.530" end="01:46:39.169" style="s2">giving and they&#39;re always worth our time</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.139" end="01:46:41.090" style="s2">and attention so it&#39;s a it&#39;s great that</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.169" end="01:46:42.530" style="s2">you&#39;re doing that and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.090" end="01:46:44.599" style="s2">people are beginning to because they see</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.530" end="01:46:46.699" style="s2">that they&#39;re not satisfied with the</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.599" end="01:46:48.889" style="s2">answers or even with the questions that</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.699" end="01:46:51.619" style="s2">are available to them now and instead of</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.889" end="01:46:53.719" style="s2">looking forward into an abyss or into</p>

<p begin="01:46:56.239" end="01:47:01.519" style="s2">possibilities of return and I think</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.979" end="01:47:03.619" style="s2">that&#39;s a worthwhile project well I mean</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.519" end="01:47:05.419" style="s2">as far as I can tell the science demands</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.619" end="01:47:06.949" style="s2">these types of questions you know the</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.419" end="01:47:09.530" style="s2">more you learn about the universe and</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.949" end="01:47:11.449" style="s2">time and space and the the more it</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.530" end="01:47:13.340" style="s2">demands these kind of questions and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.449" end="01:47:15.050" style="s2">the happier I am to embrace them and</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.340" end="01:47:20.150" style="s2">honestly I&#39;ve been hearing more and more</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.050" end="01:47:24.260" style="s2">people say I grew up without religion I</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.150" end="01:47:26.449" style="s2">actually grew up anti religion and today</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.260" end="01:47:29.119" style="s2">I&#39;m more open to the notion of religion</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.449" end="01:47:30.949" style="s2">than ever before and I have that same</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.119" end="01:47:32.209" style="s2">sentiment and that comes through what</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.949" end="01:47:34.909" style="s2">I&#39;ve found to be a rational process</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.209" end="01:47:37.579" style="s2">which contradicts everything that I ever</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.909" end="01:47:39.139" style="s2">had presupposed about spirituality or</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.579" end="01:47:41.209" style="s2">religious thought that there was a</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.139" end="01:47:43.550" style="s2">rational thought process involved in it</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.209" end="01:47:45.229" style="s2">but as the more I go through the more</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.550" end="01:47:46.880" style="s2">layers I peel back you know and the more</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.229" end="01:47:49.729" style="s2">questions we get down to the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.880" end="01:47:51.889" style="s2">questions you know you do have to what</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.729" end="01:47:54.619" style="s2">is it accepted avidity of human life at</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.889" end="01:47:56.090" style="s2">some point right we have covered a</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.619" end="01:47:58.550" style="s2">tremendous amount of ground here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.090" end="01:48:00.169" style="s2">about two hours is this is this a basics</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.550" end="01:48:02.650" style="s2">have we gotten the basics covered is</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.169" end="01:48:05.239" style="s2">there some element that we have left out</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.650" end="01:48:07.639" style="s2">do we want to wrap on this is there</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.239" end="01:48:10.610" style="s2">something to expand upon where how would</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.639" end="01:48:11.190" style="s2">you feel do you think I&#39;ve gotten a 101</p>

<p begin="01:48:11.190" end="01:48:15.420" style="s2">dougen at this point is there something</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.920" end="01:48:17.340" style="s2">else we need to hit on I think it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.420" end="01:48:17.940" style="s2">for a 101 you have the fourth political</p>

<p begin="01:48:44.250" end="01:48:49.469" style="s2">important for me and I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.900" end="01:48:52.560" style="s2">good reason to highlight it again people</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.469" end="01:48:55.260" style="s2">who listen to you who are hearing this</p>

<p begin="01:48:55.260" end="01:49:01.469" style="s2">know Strauss okay and somehow more let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.070" end="01:49:04.110" style="s2">say how would you put it like if Dugan</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.469" end="01:49:06.270" style="s2">still seems far out and far off and kind</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.110" end="01:49:07.920" style="s2">of wild or crazy because you can still</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.270" end="01:49:09.780" style="s2">take this conversation go look at them</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.920" end="01:49:11.430" style="s2">online and still think no there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.780" end="01:49:14.190" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the same guy here</p>
