<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>

<p begin="00:00:20.529" end="00:00:28.400" style="s2">welcome to the dark stoah these evening</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.820" end="00:00:32.870" style="s2">events tend to deal with darker subjects</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.400" end="00:00:35.960" style="s2">and as a disclaimer they could engender</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.870" end="00:00:38.510" style="s2">existential horror so consider yourself</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.960" end="00:00:42.620" style="s2">warned you can think of tonight&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.510" end="00:00:45.309" style="s2">session as kind of a stoic group</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.620" end="00:00:48.470" style="s2">practice in negative visualization in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.309" end="00:00:51.049" style="s2">thinking about a negative outcome that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.470" end="00:00:54.290" style="s2">may or may not maybe is little likely to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.049" end="00:00:57.559" style="s2">happen in our futures and coming to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.290" end="00:00:59.900" style="s2">terms with it emotionally and tonight</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.559" end="00:01:02.989" style="s2">we&#39;re in for a treat we have none other</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.900" end="00:01:05.320" style="s2">than Pat Ryan who some have said is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.989" end="00:01:11.830" style="s2">most dangerous man on the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.320" end="00:01:14.390" style="s2">he is talking about CRISPR which is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.830" end="00:01:15.770" style="s2">brave new world technology that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.390" end="00:01:19.670" style="s2">imagine some of you are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.770" end="00:01:22.370" style="s2">that holds a lot of promise but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.670" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">mostly existential threat and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.370" end="00:01:27.910" style="s2">gonna learn a lot more about that in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:30.380" style="s2">moment so the structure for tonight is</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.910" end="00:01:32.300" style="s2">basically I&#39;m going to hand it over to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.380" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">Pat in a moment and he&#39;s gonna take us</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.300" end="00:01:37.400" style="s2">through a presentation and at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:41.570" style="s2">that we&#39;ll have an opportunity to ask</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.400" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">him a few questions so pay attention and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.570" end="00:01:44.840" style="s2">if you come up with questions along the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:47.870" style="s2">way feel free to throw them in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.840" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">and I will speak them for you or you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.870" end="00:01:53.920" style="s2">share them once we get to the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:56.180" style="s2">presentation so without further delay</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:01:58.520" style="s2">Pat I&#39;m gonna hand it over to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.180" end="00:02:02.150" style="s2">hi folks thanks for the disclaimer</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.520" end="00:02:05.000" style="s2">Daniel I appreciate it and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.150" end="00:02:09.340" style="s2">topic that I have talked about endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.000" end="00:02:11.900" style="s2">for almost two decades so I am just</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.340" end="00:02:14.209" style="s2">completely deadened by any possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.900" end="00:02:16.760" style="s2">shock value that happens from it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.209" end="00:02:21.349" style="s2">please don&#39;t take my my flippancy as</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.760" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">arrogance here I&#39;m just fairly exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.349" end="00:02:24.560" style="s2">in terms of researching the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:29.720" style="s2">possibilities of how this is gonna pan</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.560" end="00:02:32.450" style="s2">out and thank you for coming back for</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.720" end="00:02:34.630" style="s2">I haven&#39;t scared you off yet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.450" end="00:02:40.790" style="s2">right we&#39;ll see what we can do tonight</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.630" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">CRISPR is a technology that allows one</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.790" end="00:02:50.630" style="s2">to inject DNA sequences into a cell</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:52.940" style="s2">that&#39;s basically it with one tiny</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.630" end="00:02:55.160" style="s2">difference what I just described is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.940" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">exactly how a virus works it lands on</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.160" end="00:02:59.750" style="s2">the surface membrane breaks it through</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:01.640" style="s2">deletes the DNA or blows it up and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.750" end="00:03:03.590" style="s2">injects its own DNA to then turn the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.640" end="00:03:05.870" style="s2">cell into a manufacturer for more</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.590" end="00:03:07.780" style="s2">viruses rinse and repeat what makes this</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.870" end="00:03:11.600" style="s2">different is that it doesn&#39;t blow away</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.780" end="00:03:14.590" style="s2">the host cell&#39;s DNA it keeps most of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.600" end="00:03:17.959" style="s2">intact the snippet that gets injected</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.590" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">parses through the DNA it finds exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.959" end="00:03:22.250" style="s2">what you intend to remove and then it</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:25.310" style="s2">injects what you intend to replace it</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.250" end="00:03:26.870" style="s2">with so it&#39;s kind of like opening a book</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.310" end="00:03:28.520" style="s2">and ripping out a page and putting in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.870" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">your own page to change the story</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.520" end="00:03:31.910" style="s2">you don&#39;t fundamentally destroy the book</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">in the process but you get some</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.910" end="00:03:37.269" style="s2">interesting fanfiction well in this case</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:40.160" style="s2">what happens is you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.269" end="00:03:43.310" style="s2">violating the great taboo of horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.160" end="00:03:46.310" style="s2">nuclear transfer which is something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.310" end="00:03:48.530" style="s2">nature has wisely forbade us from doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.310" end="00:03:50.510" style="s2">but we have idiotic we found a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.530" end="00:03:52.430" style="s2">around it so this is definitely our</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.510" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">destiny and we just gotta ride the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.430" end="00:03:57.500" style="s2">train see where it takes us and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:04:02.330" style="s2">hopefully this will give you a realistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.500" end="00:04:06.290" style="s2">understanding of how us humans are going</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.330" end="00:04:11.180" style="s2">to what I&#39;m gonna call we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.290" end="00:04:14.360" style="s2">Tower of Babel our own brains so before</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:18.620" style="s2">I begin the history of why we even want</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.360" end="00:04:19.970" style="s2">to do these things it&#39;ll be as brief as</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:22.760" style="s2">I can make it and I&#39;ll try to make it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.970" end="00:04:24.220" style="s2">interesting so further preference here</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.760" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.220" end="00:04:40.050" style="s2">screen okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.160" end="00:04:41.820" style="s2">and that crispers art another horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.050" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">things were probably going to do to each</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.820" end="00:04:44.790" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:50.040" style="s2">welcome to your evolution where your DNA</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.790" end="00:04:52.020" style="s2">is as flexible as your hard drive we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.040" end="00:04:54.480" style="s2">will no longer be on a line of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.020" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">we will now enter a crazy web that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.480" end="00:05:00.150" style="s2">almost impossible to predict it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">be John in the future wherever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.150" end="00:05:04.320" style="s2">our job so moving on</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:05.370" style="s2">where do we start with CRISPR well we</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.320" end="00:05:09.780" style="s2">actually start with play-doh</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.370" end="00:05:12.870" style="s2">surprisingly he wanted to create a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.780" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">society in which the leaders of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.870" end="00:05:18.060" style="s2">society were the best possible leaders</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">that people could have he called them</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.060" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">the guardians and they were voted by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:24.450" style="s2">auxiliaries and the guardians were</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:25.950" style="s2">basically philosopher Kings so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.450" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">guardians were people who guarded the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.950" end="00:05:30.990" style="s2">city from external threats and itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:33.960" style="s2">and ensured its well-being but how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.990" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">you make the Guardians care how do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.960" end="00:05:39.570" style="s2">defeat the problem of greed and people</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.900" end="00:05:40.919" style="s2">making themselves enriched from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.570" end="00:05:41.580" style="s2">position of power they find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.919" end="00:05:44.220" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.580" end="00:05:46.740" style="s2">well Plato to the rescue he turns around</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.220" end="00:05:51.150" style="s2">and says that wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.740" end="00:05:53.400" style="s2">what if we throw a yearly orgy and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.150" end="00:05:55.710" style="s2">these people come together they bump</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.400" end="00:05:57.780" style="s2">uglies and they get some kids and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.710" end="00:05:59.789" style="s2">what we want to do instead these are is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.780" end="00:06:02.460" style="s2">this is a summary of Plato forgive me</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.789" end="00:06:03.930" style="s2">and what we&#39;re gonna do is people we</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.460" end="00:06:06.750" style="s2">admire the most the traits were looking</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.930" end="00:06:09.150" style="s2">for the most well we&#39;re going to we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.750" end="00:06:10.979" style="s2">gonna make sure they breed the most so</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.150" end="00:06:12.840" style="s2">this person is a good leader or this</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.979" end="00:06:14.850" style="s2">person was a good mathematician or this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.840" end="00:06:16.740" style="s2">person is just really funny go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.850" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">pump out a bunch of kids within our</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.740" end="00:06:21.630" style="s2">Guardian cast and we&#39;ll head your bets</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:23.789" style="s2">so this is basically a hedging strategy</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.630" end="00:06:28.050" style="s2">to make sure you end up with kids that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.789" end="00:06:29.940" style="s2">are competent based on initial starting</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.050" end="00:06:31.620" style="s2">advantages as best as they could see if</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.940" end="00:06:34.320" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have a concept of genes but</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.620" end="00:06:37.500" style="s2">they did master animal breeding so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.320" end="00:06:39.240" style="s2">guess they looked at it that way so this</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.500" end="00:06:43.610" style="s2">is like a really early for me eugenics</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.240" end="00:06:46.200" style="s2">basically this idea where you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.610" end="00:06:47.990" style="s2">selecting controlling the taking natural</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.200" end="00:06:50.030" style="s2">taking the natural out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.990" end="00:06:52.250" style="s2">after election and having controlled</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.030" end="00:06:54.070" style="s2">selection it&#39;s basically it&#39;s a basic</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.250" end="00:06:57.860" style="s2">tactic that&#39;s all what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.070" end="00:06:59.450" style="s2">and again his reasoning was primarily to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.860" end="00:07:01.040" style="s2">make sure that the leaders of the city</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.450" end="00:07:02.360" style="s2">were the best possible leaders because</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.040" end="00:07:05.690" style="s2">they did not want corrupt leaders they</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.360" end="00:07:08.180" style="s2">said Plato hated democracy he fucking</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.690" end="00:07:10.870" style="s2">hated democracy he wanted nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.180" end="00:07:13.100" style="s2">with it he wanted to burn to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.870" end="00:07:15.050" style="s2">democracy killed his best friend</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.520" end="00:09:22.690" style="s2">and he was wise to understand the</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.610" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">this is population spite by Thomas</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:46.130" style="s2">so the highlighted section is basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.470" end="00:09:49.580" style="s2">he&#39;s making the case he&#39;s saying the</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:56.120" style="s2">better their lives because it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.430" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">mouth to feed</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.120" end="00:10:02.120" style="s2">yes the labor harder and those type of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:05.390" style="s2">arguments but the next argument gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.120" end="00:10:08.960" style="s2">lost in the retelling of this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.390" end="00:10:11.570" style="s2">an important point the sex drive is so</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.960" end="00:10:16.340" style="s2">strong that people are always increasing</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.570" end="00:10:18.680" style="s2">their population and as it constantly</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.340" end="00:10:21.770" style="s2">does this it causes the lower classes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.680" end="00:10:23.210" style="s2">distress and the reason for that is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.770" end="00:10:25.010" style="s2">yes of course it&#39;s more mouths to feed</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.210" end="00:10:28.100" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually there&#39;s a meta reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.010" end="00:10:31.370" style="s2">beyond that in economics reason because</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.100" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">the more people you have the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.370" end="00:10:37.100" style="s2">redundant labor you have so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:39.740" style="s2">having 20 farmers you now have 200</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.100" end="00:10:41.210" style="s2">farmers but you only need like 10 so</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.740" end="00:10:44.150" style="s2">what happened to all the redundant labor</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.210" end="00:10:46.610" style="s2">well they just kind of don&#39;t farm which</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.150" end="00:10:48.170" style="s2">means it can&#39;t buy stuff they can&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.610" end="00:10:50.230" style="s2">they can&#39;t use their skill and turn to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.170" end="00:10:51.980" style="s2">labor you know have a surplus of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.230" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">population and you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.980" end="00:10:56.660" style="s2">ability to scale your productivity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:58.220" style="s2">those people because it&#39;s the 1600s you</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.660" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">can&#39;t just like spin up a machine to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.220" end="00:11:09.350" style="s2">it for you so the population pressure</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:11.240" style="s2">causes pricing in labor to go down so</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.350" end="00:11:13.970" style="s2">the cost of labor goes down as</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.240" end="00:11:14.960" style="s2">population goes up the inverse is also</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.970" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">true as</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.960" end="00:11:20.150" style="s2">people are killed or displaced or exiled</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:24.820" style="s2">there are so few of them that the price</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.150" end="00:11:27.380" style="s2">of their labor goes up and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.820" end="00:11:30.380" style="s2">key point that is always lost with</p>

<p begin="00:11:44.150" end="00:11:50.900" style="s2">view so what he was trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:53.630" style="s2">reveal that hey it isn&#39;t just greedy</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.900" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">kings and princes being inept and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.630" end="00:11:59.120" style="s2">isn&#39;t just poor people just being stupid</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:12:02.780" style="s2">it&#39;s the very population mechanic itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.120" end="00:12:06.620" style="s2">that&#39;s driving poverty and that was his</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.780" end="00:12:09.980" style="s2">argument and it&#39;s a he&#39;s not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.620" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">wrong i if you look at it from that if</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.980" end="00:12:12.770" style="s2">you look at it from that side</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:14.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t side with them I&#39;m Malthusian</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.770" end="00:12:15.800" style="s2">it&#39;s for starters I don&#39;t like them as</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.420" end="00:12:18.860" style="s2">people I don&#39;t like the culture that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.800" end="00:12:22.070" style="s2">they end up always going towards it</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.860" end="00:12:24.430" style="s2">becomes too nihilistic and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.070" end="00:12:26.690" style="s2">celebrated before that nihilism I just</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.430" end="00:12:29.510" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a taste thing but I just</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.690" end="00:12:31.940" style="s2">don&#39;t like it but in this case he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.510" end="00:12:34.930" style="s2">making a very solid point regarding the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.940" end="00:12:43.670" style="s2">relationship of population and labor and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.930" end="00:12:45.380" style="s2">then see what is here period it&#39;s worse</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.670" end="00:12:48.830" style="s2">and worse but the forms of capitalist or</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.380" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">growing rich from yeah right so in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.830" end="00:12:52.940" style="s2">case there is now a negative side effect</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:54.590" style="s2">it&#39;s almost as if you want more poor</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.940" end="00:12:56.390" style="s2">people so that the farmers have more</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.590" end="00:12:58.100" style="s2">cheap labor and so that the capital</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.390" end="00:12:59.900" style="s2">investments get better returns on their</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.100" end="00:13:02.360" style="s2">investments so now there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.900" end="00:13:05.900" style="s2">additional negative incentive on top of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.360" end="00:13:07.430" style="s2">population rates exploding it&#39;s you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.900" end="00:13:10.520" style="s2">the poor to have as many babies as</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.430" end="00:13:13.640" style="s2">possible and so this is this is thomas</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.520" end="00:13:17.450" style="s2">malthus&#39;s argument against it as best as</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.640" end="00:13:19.070" style="s2">you can and you know you finally</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.450" end="00:14:07.580" style="s2">revelation he says crap</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.240" end="00:14:09.589" style="s2">more people are happening but if I try</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.580" end="00:14:12.080" style="s2">to do anything I&#39;m probably gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.589" end="00:14:14.060" style="s2">killed or make the situation worse so he</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.080" end="00:14:17.000" style="s2">sees the crazy train and he knows</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.060" end="00:14:20.330" style="s2">there&#39;s no stopping and he points out to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.000" end="00:14:22.550" style="s2">good effect this surprisingly goes</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.330" end="00:14:24.230" style="s2">immediately to Charles Darwin now this</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.550" end="00:14:27.290" style="s2">link isn&#39;t really well talking in</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.230" end="00:14:30.440" style="s2">evolution studies Charles Darwin he</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.290" end="00:14:33.370" style="s2">wrote Origin of Species because he read</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.440" end="00:14:36.200" style="s2">Malthus and this is from his own words</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.370" end="00:14:37.880" style="s2">from the autobiography of Charles Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.200" end="00:14:40.220" style="s2">I happen to read for the amusement</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.880" end="00:14:41.810" style="s2">Malthus on population and being well</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.220" end="00:14:44.510" style="s2">compared to appreciate the struggle for</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.810" end="00:14:46.310" style="s2">existence which everywhere goes on from</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.510" end="00:14:48.950" style="s2">long-continued observation of the habits</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.310" end="00:14:51.410" style="s2">of animals plants it at once struck me</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.950" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">that under these circumstances favorable</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.410" end="00:14:55.149" style="s2">variations would tend to be preserved</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:57.649" style="s2">and get ready for it folks and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.149" end="00:15:02.380" style="s2">unfavorable ones destroyed the result</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.649" end="00:15:02.380" style="s2">would be the formation of a new species</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.649" end="00:15:06.589" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.890" end="00:15:08.870" style="s2">let&#39;s sit this back this guy read</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.589" end="00:15:13.670" style="s2">Malthus and he discovered a way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.870" end="00:15:17.180" style="s2">create new species from it right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.670" end="00:15:20.200" style="s2">what how did anybody how could that have</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.180" end="00:15:23.000" style="s2">possibly been the take away from Elvis</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.200" end="00:15:26.120" style="s2">unfortunately he tells us the solution</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.000" end="00:15:27.980" style="s2">as I believe is that the modified</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.120" end="00:15:30.170" style="s2">offspring of all dominant increasing</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.980" end="00:15:32.510" style="s2">forms tend to be adapted to mainly and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.170" end="00:15:36.820" style="s2">highly diversified place in the economy</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.510" end="00:15:39.800" style="s2">of nature ok so here&#39;s why this matters</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.820" end="00:15:41.930" style="s2">this is how he&#39;s able to go from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.800" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">population oscillation</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.930" end="00:15:47.210" style="s2">that Malthus was talking about and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">say oh it&#39;s the economy of nature that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.210" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">we haven&#39;t accounted for there is an</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:54.339" style="s2">economy to nature there is a behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:56.510" style="s2">energy sharing resource distribution</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.339" end="00:15:58.730" style="s2">that&#39;s been going on in this background</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.510" end="00:16:01.550" style="s2">I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it but</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.730" end="00:16:04.459" style="s2">it&#39;s there and what Malthus is talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.550" end="00:16:06.529" style="s2">about is also see in the breeding habits</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.459" end="00:16:09.140" style="s2">of other analysts so the breeding of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.529" end="00:16:10.670" style="s2">humans is affecting their distribution</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.140" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">of demand for their labor and their</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.670" end="00:16:14.000" style="s2">ability and their well living and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:17.630" style="s2">also seeing the same population mechanic</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:19.430" style="s2">play out amongst animals and plants so</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.630" end="00:16:23.000" style="s2">he&#39;s able to read Malthus and extract</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.430" end="00:16:24.920" style="s2">that unique insight and it is because of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.000" end="00:16:26.260" style="s2">that that he&#39;s able to publish the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.920" end="00:16:30.290" style="s2">Origin of Species</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.260" end="00:16:31.940" style="s2">so Malthus was a key influence to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.290" end="00:16:34.220" style="s2">Charles Darwin and that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.940" end="00:16:36.950" style="s2">well researched but it&#39;s right there</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.220" end="00:16:41.420" style="s2">it&#39;s his own words and so he&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.950" end="00:16:43.190" style="s2">see the the this is humanity&#39;s attempt</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.420" end="00:16:46.630" style="s2">to try and understand population</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.190" end="00:16:49.430" style="s2">mechanics in a very clumsy way and</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.630" end="00:16:50.990" style="s2">Darwin saw in animals Malthus saw in</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.430" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">economics and when you merge those two</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.990" end="00:16:54.860" style="s2">together you realize economics was the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">actual constraint the resource</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.860" end="00:16:59.330" style="s2">distribution was the actual constraint</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:02.060" style="s2">and because of that constraint we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.330" end="00:17:03.830" style="s2">able to understand better the pressures</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.060" end="00:17:08.300" style="s2">that cause those oscillations that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.830" end="00:17:12.380" style="s2">Malthus was talking about Charles</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.300" end="00:17:15.110" style="s2">Darwin&#39;s cousin was John gulten and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.380" end="00:17:17.540" style="s2">gulten was a big supporter of Darwin and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.110" end="00:17:20.800" style="s2">Doren was a big supporter of Dalton this</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.540" end="00:17:21.980" style="s2">at this point we&#39;re in the - I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.800" end="00:17:24.380" style="s2">1800&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.980" end="00:17:28.220" style="s2">late 1800s Britain with Victorian</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.380" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">Britain so Dalton takes a look at Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.220" end="00:17:34.429" style="s2">and takes a look at Malthus and goes if</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:36.740" style="s2">we know that the population is</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.429" end="00:17:39.740" style="s2">oscillating we can either sit there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.740" end="00:17:42.620" style="s2">be a slave to it or we can do something</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.740" end="00:17:43.940" style="s2">about it so this is the birth of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.620" end="00:17:45.650" style="s2">progressive movement the modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.940" end="00:17:46.280" style="s2">progressive movement starts with John</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.650" end="00:17:48.380" style="s2">Galt</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.280" end="00:17:50.690" style="s2">and the reason so the formation of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.380" end="00:17:51.850" style="s2">blue church this is the birth of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.690" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">blue church right here</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.850" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">the modern blue church all the tactics</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.530" end="00:17:58.130" style="s2">they embrace and everything they do</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:59.870" style="s2">starts with goal because if you read</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.130" end="00:18:02.300" style="s2">that box that says that&#39;s his actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.870" end="00:18:04.310" style="s2">words what he&#39;s saying is he&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.300" end="00:18:07.670" style="s2">the case for the world we live in right</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.310" end="00:18:10.040" style="s2">now and he&#39;s explaining how you engineer</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.670" end="00:18:12.590" style="s2">the times that they&#39;re in at that point</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.040" end="00:18:18.620" style="s2">to get this world we have today a world</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.590" end="00:18:20.900" style="s2">which would be one in which society was</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.620" end="00:18:22.700" style="s2">not costly so there&#39;s there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.900" end="00:18:25.040" style="s2">abundance of price pressures that drive</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.700" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">the prices down where incomes were</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">sources so you don&#39;t have scumbags and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.370" end="00:18:36.200" style="s2">and bankers all over the place you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.750" end="00:18:46.460" style="s2">Kings and in the church effectively no</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.410" end="00:18:52.280" style="s2">he&#39;s highly gifted C first-class</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.270" end="00:18:53.930" style="s2">education and can enter the professional</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.750" end="00:19:04.370" style="s2">abundance of opportunity that he wants</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.610" end="00:19:05.990" style="s2">to create where the marriage is held in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.370" end="00:19:08.780" style="s2">a high honor honor as it wasn&#39;t Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.990" end="00:19:10.040" style="s2">times where the pride of the race was</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.780" end="00:19:12.740" style="s2">encouraged and even here he makes the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.040" end="00:19:14.900" style="s2">footnote he doesn&#39;t mean the race</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.740" end="00:19:16.010" style="s2">Sciences he doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not what he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.010" end="00:19:21.920" style="s2">makes that very clear where the weak</p>

<p begin="00:20:49.420" end="00:20:55.450" style="s2">then build the society we want to build</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.350" end="00:20:57.370" style="s2">and we don&#39;t need a central power to do</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.450" end="00:21:13.960" style="s2">able to do that too this was this was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.540" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">very charged argument for certain sects</p>

<p begin="00:21:19.630" end="00:21:25.150" style="s2">that was becoming more and more popular</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.490" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">so at this point the Europeans are</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.520" end="00:21:41.830" style="s2">starting to say hey they&#39;re inching</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.490" end="00:23:16.649" style="s2">solve gambling there&#39;s a there&#39;s a funny</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.010" end="00:23:18.450" style="s2">problem they encounter where if you and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.649" end="00:23:22.230" style="s2">I decide to play a gambling game we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.450" end="00:23:23.820" style="s2">rolling dice and the game suddenly ends</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.230" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">because a bunch of assholes come in and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.820" end="00:23:27.179" style="s2">you know they chase us out because they</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:29.220" style="s2">don&#39;t want splaying well how do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.179" end="00:23:31.500" style="s2">figure out the split of the putt that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.220" end="00:23:33.539" style="s2">we&#39;ve already played into do I split</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.500" end="00:23:35.370" style="s2">fifty-fifty do you get more because</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.539" end="00:23:38.399" style="s2">you&#39;ve won more it&#39;s an uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.370" end="00:23:41.490" style="s2">way to like how do you fairly figure out</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.399" end="00:23:43.470" style="s2">how this game was going to resolve if</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.490" end="00:23:46.679" style="s2">the game is entirely powered by random</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.470" end="00:23:48.539" style="s2">forces it&#39;s it&#39;s this like an insurance</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.679" end="00:23:50.100" style="s2">problem basically well that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.539" end="00:23:52.350" style="s2">concept of the expected value comes from</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.100" end="00:23:54.990" style="s2">so these two guys they decided to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.350" end="00:23:58.830" style="s2">hey we&#39;re gonna solve this problem about</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.990" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">figuring out the probability of how</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.830" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">these dice were going to turn out at</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:05.909" style="s2">this time and then the payout will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:07.740" style="s2">divided along that number instead and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.909" end="00:24:09.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the fairest distribution that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.740" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">can do in a game that has driven</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.240" end="00:24:13.770" style="s2">entirely by randomness of course because</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:16.440" style="s2">they solved this problem they saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.770" end="00:24:18.659" style="s2">gambling which inevitably led to casinos</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.440" end="00:24:21.169" style="s2">which from casinos leads to Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.659" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">so these guys were making America great</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.169" end="00:24:28.230" style="s2">way back when</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:30.390" style="s2">meanwhile from here Mendell decides to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.230" end="00:24:32.030" style="s2">say hey this probability thing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.390" end="00:24:34.770" style="s2">pretty interesting let&#39;s apply it the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.030" end="00:24:37.560" style="s2">heredity heredity support I always</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.770" end="00:24:40.110" style="s2">struggle with so heredity back then was</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.560" end="00:24:42.810" style="s2">like trees and branches and so and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.110" end="00:24:45.180" style="s2">begat so and so begat so and so they</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.810" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">were like linear lines of who&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.180" end="00:24:49.410" style="s2">Mendel was like that stupid I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:51.390" style="s2">probability probably has something to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.410" end="00:24:54.600" style="s2">with this so I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna take a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.390" end="00:25:00.180" style="s2">whack at that and he comes up with this</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.600" end="00:25:01.920" style="s2">little concept this there where he he</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.180" end="00:25:04.050" style="s2">starts very small in a way that he can</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.920" end="00:25:05.940" style="s2">control and predict he start some plants</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.050" end="00:25:09.030" style="s2">he says if I put this pollen in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.940" end="00:25:10.380" style="s2">pistol then I get these properties if I</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.030" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">mix them in these ways then they get</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.380" end="00:25:15.330" style="s2">these properties so he&#39;s able to apply</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:18.060" style="s2">like set theory probability to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.330" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">outcomes of breeding for very simple</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.060" end="00:25:25.710" style="s2">beings starts with plants it moves very</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:27.750" style="s2">tiny animals afterwards now this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.710" end="00:25:28.920" style="s2">revolutionary in and of itself no one</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.750" end="00:25:30.750" style="s2">had ever done this before</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.920" end="00:25:32.580" style="s2">in fact because no one had ever done</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.750" end="00:25:35.490" style="s2">this before his work wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.580" end="00:25:38.160" style="s2">understood history almost completely did</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.160" end="00:25:42.990" style="s2">total randomness ironically given the</p>

<p begin="00:25:42.990" end="00:25:48.990" style="s2">were even found it&#39;s almost as if the if</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.750" end="00:26:09.810" style="s2">discovery he&#39;s able to then take the</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.810" end="00:26:14.490" style="s2">just kings and princes and and causality</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.210" end="00:26:15.540" style="s2">some randomness here and we can actually</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.040" end="00:26:31.260" style="s2">fucking guy like I could speak on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.680" end="00:26:33.390" style="s2">man for hours this guy is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.260" end="00:26:37.770" style="s2">insane but he&#39;s also incredibly charming</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.390" end="00:26:38.820" style="s2">his name is JBS Haldane now how Ben I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.770" end="00:26:40.560" style="s2">gonna talk about him then I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.820" end="00:26:41.790" style="s2">explain why what he did was important</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.560" end="00:26:44.010" style="s2">and the two things have nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.790" end="00:26:48.930" style="s2">common so</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.010" end="00:26:52.380" style="s2">so Haldane was he was the only person</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.930" end="00:26:54.330" style="s2">who loved World War one alright there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.380" end="00:26:54.900" style="s2">gotta start there right he loved World</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.620" end="00:27:05.160" style="s2">authorised he&#39;d crawl out of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:07.590" style="s2">trenches with his mortar team and just</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.160" end="00:27:08.850" style="s2">dump mortars randomly on Germans and</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.140" end="00:27:50.700" style="s2">is he&#39;s able to research linking how</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.460" end="00:28:02.250" style="s2">trait from these parents is passed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.730" end="00:28:04.260" style="s2">these mice so he&#39;s able to take Mendel</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.250" end="00:28:06.510" style="s2">and apply it to mammals does it with</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.260" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">mice first but it gets progressively</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.510" end="00:28:11.160" style="s2">good some more and more stuff so because</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:14.910" style="s2">of this he&#39;s actually the foundation of</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.840" end="00:29:10.180" style="s2">on all of this is the backdrop for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.380" end="00:29:11.650" style="s2">20th century and I believe the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.180" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">century can be summed up as the holy</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.950" end="00:29:26.680" style="s2">this and the other guy says I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.270" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">form a project to do this and you have a</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:33.310" style="s2">anyway just fucking do it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.570" end="00:29:34.750" style="s2">pretty prominent in Linux but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.310" end="00:29:37.660" style="s2">what I mean by all those words so to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.750" end="00:29:39.490" style="s2">control the evolution of evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.660" end="00:29:41.530" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of recursive but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.490" end="00:29:43.060" style="s2">important because evolution itself is</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.060" end="00:29:46.810" style="s2">along so you want to control and iterate</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.620" end="00:29:50.470" style="s2">this process which is the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.810" end="00:29:51.550" style="s2">evolution so just to recap everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.470" end="00:29:53.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.550" end="00:29:55.750" style="s2">treating the evolution of evolution as</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.650" end="00:29:57.580" style="s2">policy so we start with play-doh</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.750" end="00:30:00.190" style="s2">control the breeding of the elites</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.580" end="00:30:01.690" style="s2">middle ages where that&#39;s the elites a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.190" end="00:30:04.390" style="s2">fine sounds like a good plan to me and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.690" end="00:30:05.740" style="s2">they do it forever if Malthus who says I</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.390" end="00:30:08.470" style="s2">but we also got to control the breeding</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.740" end="00:30:10.620" style="s2">of the poor Darwin says hey we can make</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.470" end="00:30:12.670" style="s2">new species through breeding that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.620" end="00:30:13.900" style="s2">and then the EM gauntlet says we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.670" end="00:30:16.570" style="s2">going to systematically control the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.900" end="00:30:18.730" style="s2">greeting in the name of public health so</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.600" end="00:33:47.070" style="s2">probably not even going to be the answer</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.280" end="00:33:49.380" style="s2">but because we figured out how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.070" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">it we will figure out ways to improve it</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.380" end="00:33:51.930" style="s2">whether the final solution is CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:55.020" style="s2">whether it&#39;s something else doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.930" end="00:33:56.910" style="s2">matter this has been tasted this</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.910" end="00:34:01.800" style="s2">enough for people to keep trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.110" end="00:34:05.340" style="s2">apply on it and this is where it changes</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.800" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">because policy failed for the exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.340" end="00:34:08.790" style="s2">reason that their only means of</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.190" end="00:34:20.970" style="s2">breeding from the execution required to</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.970" end="00:34:25.820" style="s2">sex completely out of the picture now</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.890" end="00:34:30.060" style="s2">and you can still get Colton&#39;s vision</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.820" end="00:34:33.630" style="s2">this is a mind-blowing possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.060" end="00:34:35.700" style="s2">we have the unfortunate timing to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.630" end="00:34:37.020" style="s2">born at the beginning of you definitely</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.700" end="00:34:40.770" style="s2">want to be at the end of this you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.020" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">want to be at the beginning and let me</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.770" end="00:34:44.730" style="s2">explain why what have we done without</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:47.220" style="s2">this crazy technology right what have we</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.730" end="00:34:48.780" style="s2">actually done to breeding where we</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:53.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the ability to do all this</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.780" end="00:34:56.460" style="s2">magic shit well when death is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.120" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">we have found ways to breed animals into</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.460" end="00:35:02.130" style="s2">apparently Arnold Schwarzenegger so what</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:04.920" style="s2">this means is we were bulking these</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.130" end="00:35:07.080" style="s2">critters up because death is valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.920" end="00:35:09.540" style="s2">them you only kill them once and so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.080" end="00:35:10.830" style="s2">want to maximize the amount of meat that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.540" end="00:35:12.810" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get from the kill</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.830" end="00:35:15.060" style="s2">so when death is the primary source of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.810" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">value generation you&#39;re gonna make this</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.060" end="00:35:19.470" style="s2">super freeze because you can only kill</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:21.420" style="s2">them once now what happens when life is</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.470" end="00:35:23.150" style="s2">valuable now you might think oh well</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.420" end="00:35:25.380" style="s2">life is valuable that sounds good you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.150" end="00:35:27.090" style="s2">gonna make fucking sexy nose a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.380" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">bit of please no you&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.090" end="00:35:34.470" style="s2">fucking mutts start it as a wolf like</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:37.050" style="s2">that thing it&#39;s like torture and a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.470" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">genome but that&#39;s what we did we did</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.050" end="00:35:40.019" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:42.450" style="s2">life was valuable we one of these</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.019" end="00:35:45.240" style="s2">critters around us this is what we did</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.450" end="00:35:47.130" style="s2">and what you&#39;re looking at here this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.240" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">this is a glimpse of the future for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.130" end="00:35:52.529" style="s2">human species we&#39;re gonna do that shit</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:55.049" style="s2">to us I will put money on it we will do</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.529" end="00:36:01.529" style="s2">that shit to ourselves because life is</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.049" end="00:36:03.690" style="s2">valuable and here&#39;s again evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.529" end="00:36:05.460" style="s2">evolution this policy we have the</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.289" end="00:36:25.920" style="s2">this was this thing was like this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.769" end="00:36:28.829" style="s2">like the carpet bombing solution to what</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.920" end="00:36:30.329" style="s2">gulten wanted for guys probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.829" end="00:36:35.160" style="s2">know this but this is a this is a birth</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.329" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">control dispenser so this thing was just</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.160" end="00:36:42.510" style="s2">like it was just throw them right into a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">society and fuck all let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.510" end="00:36:47.160" style="s2">happens this was just like the carpet</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:53.309" style="s2">bombing approach to get the answer you</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.160" end="00:36:55.619" style="s2">were looking for and oh my god it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.309" end="00:36:58.019" style="s2">ended up experiencing all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.619" end="00:36:59.819" style="s2">that Malthus warned us would happen and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.019" end="00:37:01.259" style="s2">we just didn&#39;t give a shit we were so</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.819" end="00:37:05.150" style="s2">desperate to have a solution we just</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.259" end="00:37:08.549" style="s2">threw fucking this at it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.150" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">population control propaganda you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.549" end="00:37:11.430" style="s2">seen this like all the singing people in</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:13.019" style="s2">the earth we got stopped and it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.430" end="00:37:14.700" style="s2">get out of hand you got to do something</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.019" end="00:37:17.009" style="s2">about this so this starts happening all</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.700" end="00:37:20.490" style="s2">of which generates this wonderful little</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.009" end="00:37:23.460" style="s2">line of population growth expected to go</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.490" end="00:37:25.559" style="s2">down this of course is false the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.460" end="00:37:27.329" style="s2">do go up for nations that don&#39;t practice</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.559" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">it only the advanced nations do this</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.329" end="00:37:31.740" style="s2">stuff the self-determination stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:34.049" style="s2">because we&#39;re too busy trying to chase</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.740" end="00:37:35.460" style="s2">Galton we want that perfect society and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.049" end="00:37:37.140" style="s2">if we have to eliminate ourselves to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.460" end="00:37:39.779" style="s2">it Soviet that&#39;s what we&#39;re aiming for</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.140" end="00:37:42.150" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to you gently reach a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.779" end="00:37:43.980" style="s2">eugenic equilibrium and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.150" end="00:37:46.019" style="s2">humans have done without Christmas so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.980" end="00:37:47.759" style="s2">have fucked with population mechanics as</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.019" end="00:37:50.309" style="s2">much as possible throughout most of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.759" end="00:37:52.420" style="s2">20th century and if you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.309" end="00:37:55.600" style="s2">reasons why the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.420" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">so incredibly unstable here you go</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.600" end="00:38:03.580" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at it the holy wars for</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">the evolution of evolution but now</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.580" end="00:38:08.590" style="s2">because of CRISPR it&#39;s not gonna be holy</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:10.150" style="s2">wars anymore it&#39;s gonna be a race it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.590" end="00:38:13.690" style="s2">only a race to control the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.150" end="00:38:15.970" style="s2">evolution so again here&#39;s how CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.690" end="00:38:18.610" style="s2">works lands on a Cell says hey little</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.970" end="00:38:21.190" style="s2">cell squirts in DNA and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.610" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">instead of blown out your DNA I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.190" end="00:38:24.970" style="s2">scan your DNA I wanna I want to replace</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:27.220" style="s2">this look this fuck check it out throw</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.970" end="00:38:29.260" style="s2">this in rookie gun we&#39;re good all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.220" end="00:38:31.390" style="s2">DNA keeps going the new DNA is in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.260" end="00:38:34.810" style="s2">wholesale boost in mitosis and then poof</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.390" end="00:38:36.670" style="s2">you have new DNA which means I could pop</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.810" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">some shittin me and if it spreads</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.670" end="00:38:40.120" style="s2">through all of the virus spreads through</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:41.650" style="s2">me or the virus delivery mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.120" end="00:38:44.200" style="s2">spreads through me I will replace the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.650" end="00:38:45.820" style="s2">DNA and all of my cells eventually so</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.200" end="00:38:50.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like hot swapping my genetic code</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.820" end="00:38:55.420" style="s2">on the fly and by the way this CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.340" end="00:38:58.930" style="s2">$140 that&#39;s it for a test kit so this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.420" end="00:39:01.420" style="s2">cheap it&#39;s only gonna get cheaper so</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.930" end="00:39:05.950" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done is because we no longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.420" end="00:39:08.230" style="s2">need population mechanics to do this</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.950" end="00:39:10.020" style="s2">type of research we can now focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.230" end="00:39:13.810" style="s2">end of the Joule level which gives us</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.020" end="00:39:18.610" style="s2">phylogenetic efficiency as an observed</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.810" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">orient direct decision act so start with</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.610" end="00:39:22.510" style="s2">me observe the sequences we look at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.320" end="00:39:24.040" style="s2">the letters and the distributions we</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.510" end="00:39:25.750" style="s2">reconstruct the evolutionary histories</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.040" end="00:39:27.370" style="s2">from here so we get a timeline so we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.750" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">figure out okay here&#39;s how these things</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.370" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">are going we can learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:32.620" style="s2">evolutionary processes so we can make</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:34.630" style="s2">some theories about if you alter this</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.620" end="00:39:36.220" style="s2">DNA what do we get and then we you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.630" end="00:39:37.840" style="s2">we check our work and then we come back</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.220" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">and we look around around around we go</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.840" end="00:39:41.620" style="s2">right so we go to empirical we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:43.570" style="s2">theoretical bouncing around</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.620" end="00:39:46.540" style="s2">epistemological II was figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.570" end="00:39:49.630" style="s2">we can start modifying the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.540" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">development of these species to species</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.630" end="00:39:56.080" style="s2">trees now we can we have only been bound</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:57.910" style="s2">by population mechanics to do that hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.080" end="00:40:00.490" style="s2">throw CRISPR in the mix now and get down</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.910" end="00:40:02.290" style="s2">to the individual oh and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.490" end="00:40:05.260" style="s2">because we&#39;re talking efficiency now we</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.290" end="00:40:06.190" style="s2">have economics and I&#39;ll be able to walk</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.260" end="00:40:09.040" style="s2">into this and you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.190" end="00:40:10.330" style="s2">well the problems immediately start so</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:13.330" style="s2">the evolution of evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.330" end="00:40:15.340" style="s2">efficiency efficiency will close because</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.330" end="00:40:18.100" style="s2">there are multiple metrics of efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.340" end="00:40:20.200" style="s2">and now what I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.100" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">to present six models of efficiency in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.200" end="00:40:23.230" style="s2">the order in which I believe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:23.800" style="s2">going to play out over the next hundred</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.230" end="00:40:26.770" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.800" end="00:40:29.260" style="s2">so CRISPR should aim from the least</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.770" end="00:40:31.900" style="s2">amount of computational complexity this</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.260" end="00:40:34.510" style="s2">is known as a analysis of algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.900" end="00:40:36.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a big o-notation in computer</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.510" end="00:40:38.740" style="s2">science right so what this is is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.880" end="00:40:42.100" style="s2">trying to create a CRISPR that does the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.740" end="00:40:44.860" style="s2">maximum amount of computation with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.100" end="00:40:47.350" style="s2">least amount of complexity in this case</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.860" end="00:40:49.420" style="s2">and once you select for that you will</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.350" end="00:40:51.640" style="s2">have achieved a level of efficiency from</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.420" end="00:40:53.290" style="s2">the CRISPR delivery system itself so</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.640" end="00:40:55.780" style="s2">you&#39;ll have figured out the easiest way</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.290" end="00:40:57.550" style="s2">to compress it down for mass production</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.780" end="00:41:00.040" style="s2">right so that&#39;s the first thing you want</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.550" end="00:41:01.930" style="s2">to do next thing is you should find the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.040" end="00:41:03.970" style="s2">lowest cost for that production so now</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.930" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">that you have the theoretical means of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.970" end="00:41:08.920" style="s2">the complexity down to its least amount</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:10.900" style="s2">now we want to mass-produce this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.920" end="00:41:11.860" style="s2">so we got to figure out what the prices</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.900" end="00:41:13.870" style="s2">we got to figure out how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.860" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">manufacture that least amount of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.870" end="00:41:17.500" style="s2">complexity how do we mass-produce it one</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.000" end="00:41:19.390" style="s2">of our techniques are materials needed</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.500" end="00:41:21.990" style="s2">trainings needed you know the entire</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.390" end="00:41:25.890" style="s2">price discovery mechanism writ large</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.990" end="00:41:28.330" style="s2">from there you want to do out allative</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.890" end="00:41:31.240" style="s2">efficiencies which means you want to now</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.330" end="00:41:32.950" style="s2">talk about the quality of the crispin as</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.240" end="00:41:34.630" style="s2">now we&#39;re talking about before we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.950" end="00:41:36.100" style="s2">just talking about can we do it yes can</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.630" end="00:41:37.810" style="s2">we get a cheap yes okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.100" end="00:41:39.640" style="s2">now because we can do it cheap there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.810" end="00:41:41.950" style="s2">gonna be a lot of competition what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.640" end="00:41:43.450" style="s2">the quality of my CRISPR what is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.950" end="00:41:45.190" style="s2">marginal benefit I can provide the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.450" end="00:41:46.870" style="s2">consumers relative to the marginal cost</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.190" end="00:41:48.700" style="s2">in production how do I differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.870" end="00:41:50.230" style="s2">myself and say that the CRISPR I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.700" end="00:41:51.580" style="s2">providing is way better than that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.230" end="00:41:53.890" style="s2">assholes CRISPR over there he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.580" end="00:41:56.050" style="s2">fucking moron my shit&#39;s great so now</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.890" end="00:41:59.410" style="s2">we&#39;re playing this this competitive game</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.050" end="00:42:01.990" style="s2">in the economic space so then we</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.410" end="00:42:03.910" style="s2">eventually did we get the Pareto rules</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.990" end="00:42:07.120" style="s2">where we figure out the Pareto frontier</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.910" end="00:42:08.320" style="s2">and we&#39;re saying well um now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.120" end="00:42:10.270" style="s2">shifting into this kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.320" end="00:42:12.370" style="s2">political space where where we want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.270" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">achieve the maximum adoption until no</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.370" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">one else is made worse off so so as this</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">game involves you&#39;re going to discover</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">the Pareto frontier where no more</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:21.830" style="s2">further</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:23.240" style="s2">tinkering - this is actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.830" end="00:42:25.070" style="s2">improve this the pre or frontier will</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.240" end="00:42:26.180" style="s2">just cut it off right there on the spot</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.070" end="00:42:27.590" style="s2">we won&#39;t be able to get any more</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.180" end="00:42:30.140" style="s2">efficiencies so all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.590" end="00:42:32.450" style="s2">combined will draw that Pareto line out</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.140" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">and that will be the end of the game of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.450" end="00:42:36.860" style="s2">proficiency now we go to the game of</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:39.320" style="s2">meta efficiency this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.860" end="00:42:42.130" style="s2">frontier and the scientists and the new</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.320" end="00:42:44.570" style="s2">brilliant thinkers and the real sexy</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.130" end="00:42:46.220" style="s2">marketing of CRISPR has a great</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.570" end="00:42:47.570" style="s2">wonderful discovery is this collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.220" end="00:42:49.310" style="s2">thing we&#39;re all doing the futures</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.570" end="00:42:51.350" style="s2">company so bright as soon as it hits</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.310" end="00:42:54.350" style="s2">this hard frontier the whole narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.350" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">switches pretty much overnight now we</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.350" end="00:42:57.650" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:43:00.980" style="s2">planned obsolescence and rebounding</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.650" end="00:43:03.470" style="s2">demand so now we&#39;re talking about hmm</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.980" end="00:43:05.870" style="s2">I&#39;m already getting my CRISPR down to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.470" end="00:43:07.190" style="s2">price to unit economics I need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.870" end="00:43:10.100" style="s2">maximize the amount of demand</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.190" end="00:43:13.670" style="s2">permanently so how can I put CRISPR in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.100" end="00:43:16.610" style="s2">place to where if if the man for it goes</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.670" end="00:43:18.140" style="s2">down the price still goes up how can I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.610" end="00:43:20.270" style="s2">get it into place where demand goes up</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.140" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">the price still goes up now this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.270" end="00:43:26.180" style="s2">called Jevons paradox and in economics</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:28.100" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea of oil oil is a different</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.180" end="00:43:31.340" style="s2">type of commodity because the more you</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.100" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">consume it the more you need and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.340" end="00:43:35.180" style="s2">reason for that is because without oil</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:37.940" style="s2">you need donkeys and slaves to do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.180" end="00:43:40.760" style="s2">so in order for me to do work I need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.940" end="00:43:43.070" style="s2">excuse me I need to consume oil to drive</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.760" end="00:43:44.990" style="s2">my ass to work which is going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.070" end="00:43:47.840" style="s2">assuming a factory it&#39;s going to need</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.990" end="00:43:49.700" style="s2">oil to run so the more I&#39;m consuming oil</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.840" end="00:43:52.250" style="s2">the more work I can do that requires</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.700" end="00:43:54.230" style="s2">more demand for oil down the line and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.250" end="00:43:56.090" style="s2">this creates this Jevons paradox where</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.230" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">the demand for it goes up the cost goes</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.090" end="00:44:02.420" style="s2">up the demand for it goes down the cost</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:05.120" style="s2">goes up some sneaky terrible human being</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.420" end="00:44:07.190" style="s2">is going to find a way to bind CRISPR to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.120" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">this behavior and when that happens all</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.190" end="00:44:11.150" style="s2">bets are off because then you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:12.890" style="s2">about CRISPR purely returning maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.150" end="00:44:14.510" style="s2">shareholder returns at that point has</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.890" end="00:44:16.700" style="s2">nothing to do with quality has nothing</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.510" end="00:44:18.020" style="s2">to do with public health or anything is</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.700" end="00:44:19.610" style="s2">just all the fucking brown all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.020" end="00:44:23.150" style="s2">fucking wheels are off and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.610" end="00:44:25.970" style="s2">crazy trained forever so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.150" end="00:44:27.560" style="s2">order I think the efficiency pathing</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.970" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">will go it should take about a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.560" end="00:44:32.780" style="s2">years once you get here just try and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:35.150" style="s2">find a way off the planet because it</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.780" end="00:44:38.359" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.150" end="00:44:40.190" style="s2">so what does this look like what does</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.359" end="00:44:43.309" style="s2">the marketing looked like as these</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.190" end="00:44:46.309" style="s2">efficiency games play out what does</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.309" end="00:44:48.200" style="s2">Gucci think about this what is Louis</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.309" end="00:44:50.210" style="s2">Vuitton think about this I think we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.619" end="00:44:54.829" style="s2">let me just give you an example of this</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.059" end="00:45:29.119" style="s2">now we&#39;re talking CRISPR is fully</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.119" end="00:45:32.270" style="s2">at this point so all the artists and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.220" end="00:45:35.470" style="s2">creatives and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.270" end="00:45:37.730" style="s2">experimenting with it I mean I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.470" end="00:45:39.650" style="s2">layer in like a couple years ago I tried</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.730" end="00:45:43.730" style="s2">to start a Kickstarter for this process</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.650" end="00:45:46.940" style="s2">thank God banded like 30 minutes nobody</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.730" end="00:45:48.680" style="s2">would have wanted to allow me to start</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.680" end="00:45:54.529" style="s2">and selling the CRISPR apparently I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.839" end="00:45:55.789" style="s2">way too ahead of my time but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.529" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">type of marketing you&#39;ll definitely be</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.789" end="00:46:00.410" style="s2">saying and think about it from the</p>

<p begin="00:46:12.950" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">well they may look at this and say if I</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.650" end="00:46:19.730" style="s2">was more like these people then I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:21.470" style="s2">have an advantage so there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.730" end="00:46:23.029" style="s2">incentive for these people to them</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.470" end="00:46:24.950" style="s2">don&#39;t CRISPR in themselves and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.029" end="00:46:27.109" style="s2">be the Indian rock it&#39;s gonna make some</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.950" end="00:46:29.270" style="s2">creep beats and looks fly for all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.109" end="00:46:31.069" style="s2">ladies right that&#39;s what I want that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.270" end="00:46:32.390" style="s2">gonna maximize my chances in the game</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.069" end="00:46:34.099" style="s2">yeah but you&#39;re not the only one doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.390" end="00:46:36.349" style="s2">it everybody&#39;s doing it billions of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.099" end="00:46:38.809" style="s2">people are doing it so so any type of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.349" end="00:46:41.539" style="s2">perceived benefit if everybody can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.809" end="00:46:43.039" style="s2">Kanye in less than what Kanye West does</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.539" end="00:46:44.869" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s it&#39;s now a cheap</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.039" end="00:46:46.470" style="s2">commodity cuz everybody can do it if</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.869" end="00:46:48.540" style="s2">it&#39;s genetically you know previous</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.470" end="00:46:49.950" style="s2">position whatever however it expresses</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.540" end="00:46:52.740" style="s2">of course as a question of nature versus</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.950" end="00:46:54.390" style="s2">nurture I get that but for marketing</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.740" end="00:46:55.619" style="s2">reasons I&#39;m stricking and speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.390" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">marketing perception that&#39;s how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.619" end="00:46:57.450" style="s2">gonna be sold and that&#39;s how it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:46:58.950" style="s2">be bought</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.450" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">does that promise is gonna be made</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.950" end="00:47:04.740" style="s2">people about buying bulk whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:07.080" style="s2">true or not doesn&#39;t matter and then from</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.740" end="00:47:08.550" style="s2">the production manufacturing side okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.080" end="00:47:10.250" style="s2">now I can pay back my investors because</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.550" end="00:47:12.450" style="s2">I&#39;m hitting this markets at scale</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.250" end="00:47:14.190" style="s2">eventually people start making policies</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.450" end="00:47:15.750" style="s2">to be of subsidies to these producers</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.190" end="00:47:17.580" style="s2">say hey come to my nation and make some</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.750" end="00:47:20.190" style="s2">you know super humans as you promised</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.580" end="00:47:21.990" style="s2">you can and then we will subsidize when</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.190" end="00:47:26.040" style="s2">we eat some of the risks to incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.990" end="00:47:28.830" style="s2">it further it&#39;s just one example I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.040" end="00:47:35.550" style="s2">we look at Kanye enough moving on what</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.830" end="00:47:39.570" style="s2">about the fashion industry that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.550" end="00:47:42.599" style="s2">tumor that&#39;s a CRISPR fad what I can do</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.570" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">to my skin aren&#39;t I cool kind of status</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.599" end="00:47:46.740" style="s2">games can we play here it&#39;s gonna drive</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:51.960" style="s2">marketing it&#39;s gonna reach here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.740" end="00:47:54.180" style="s2">gonna push the whole thing we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.960" end="00:47:56.780" style="s2">starting to see artists playing around</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.180" end="00:47:59.700" style="s2">the concept this is Patricia Puccini I</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.780" end="00:48:03.030" style="s2">think I&#39;m pronouncing that right night</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.700" end="00:48:04.980" style="s2">times terrible but here is an example of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.030" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">what appears to be obvious animal</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.980" end="00:48:10.170" style="s2">features being grafted onto humanoid</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:12.690" style="s2">types of beings there are this is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.170" end="00:48:14.940" style="s2">favorite artist of very elite people by</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.690" end="00:48:19.740" style="s2">the way if you look up this name I see</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.940" end="00:48:23.790" style="s2">some stuff obviously a bat nose enlarged</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.740" end="00:48:25.800" style="s2">flipper like hands one foot cleft palate</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.790" end="00:48:30.589" style="s2">looks a little bit like a seal because</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.800" end="00:48:33.420" style="s2">the detail obviously dog based features</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.589" end="00:48:36.180" style="s2">some fucking weird me I know that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.420" end="00:48:38.849" style="s2">longs in mortal combat but what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.180" end="00:48:41.550" style="s2">seeing now this is an example of of gene</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.849" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">Punk so you know what cyberpunk is and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.550" end="00:48:45.930" style="s2">you know what steampunk is what&#39;s gene</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">pump gene Punk is just I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.930" end="00:48:49.950" style="s2">intentionally trash my genome now you</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:51.810" style="s2">know you get tattoos you want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.950" end="00:48:53.609" style="s2">badass I&#39;m gonna look like a literal</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.810" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">fucking monster now because yeah cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.609" end="00:48:58.349" style="s2">hate my dad now you&#39;re gonna see that</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.680" end="00:49:00.239" style="s2">and that&#39;s gonna happen and the artists</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.349" end="00:49:02.099" style="s2">are already experimenting with what</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.239" end="00:49:04.259" style="s2">visually looks like that&#39;s some some</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.099" end="00:49:05.849" style="s2">damn good skin tone I gotta say for art</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.259" end="00:49:07.379" style="s2">first time I saw and I thought they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.849" end="00:49:12.419" style="s2">actually real I thought they were actual</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.379" end="00:49:14.999" style="s2">chimera but this is this is on the table</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.419" end="00:49:19.289" style="s2">too it&#39;s not just the sexy stuff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.999" end="00:49:22.109" style="s2">the monsters too so where does all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.289" end="00:49:24.239" style="s2">this art lead us to all of this art and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.109" end="00:49:26.519" style="s2">marketing it goes to memes controlling</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.239" end="00:49:28.859" style="s2">genes instead of natural instead of</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.519" end="00:49:30.569" style="s2">breeding and mating as the primary means</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.859" end="00:49:32.879" style="s2">of getting the maximum amount of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.569" end="00:49:35.189" style="s2">advantage for your distribution whoever</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.879" end="00:49:37.409" style="s2">controls the means the memes will be</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.189" end="00:49:39.059" style="s2">able to control that distribution all</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.409" end="00:49:42.149" style="s2">the same you&#39;ll be reading out of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.059" end="00:49:44.039" style="s2">entirely so you get the little puppies</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.149" end="00:49:49.049" style="s2">around around doing this pepé thing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.039" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">bang right no we&#39;re gonna buy t-shirts</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.049" end="00:49:53.069" style="s2">of Pepe look like tattoos of Pepe some</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:55.019" style="s2">merch and whatever gene edits you got</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.069" end="00:49:57.629" style="s2">bro throw them on top no problem I want</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.019" end="00:49:59.069" style="s2">that fucking frog look so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.629" end="00:50:00.719" style="s2">someone Chris throws up some stuff cuz</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.069" end="00:50:02.489" style="s2">there&#39;s obvious demand for it you get</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.719" end="00:50:05.339" style="s2">the Pepe meme gene from her in two bucks</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.489" end="00:50:07.459" style="s2">whatever and then poof now what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.339" end="00:50:11.729" style="s2">done is we&#39;ve taken the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.459" end="00:50:15.029" style="s2">human fill a genetics or phylogenetics</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.729" end="00:50:17.519" style="s2">and we&#39;ve attached mimetic G markers</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.029" end="00:50:20.669" style="s2">throughout the human species we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.519" end="00:50:25.399" style="s2">able to see the effect of advertising in</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.669" end="00:50:29.519" style="s2">our own genome that&#39;s terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.399" end="00:50:32.069" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely fucking terrifying but</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.519" end="00:50:35.579" style="s2">this will be the primary means in which</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.069" end="00:50:37.769" style="s2">the eugenicist s-- will go this is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.579" end="00:50:39.329" style="s2">cheapest way you can do it because you</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.769" end="00:50:41.549" style="s2">don&#39;t need to control the entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.329" end="00:50:43.259" style="s2">production system of CRISPR that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.549" end="00:50:45.749" style="s2">some eggheads are going to play that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.259" end="00:50:48.059" style="s2">game of efficiency of efficiency it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.749" end="00:50:49.499" style="s2">these guys these are the guys who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.059" end="00:50:51.929" style="s2">going to control the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.499" end="00:50:54.539" style="s2">what humanity&#39;s future is at the genomic</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.929" end="00:50:57.539" style="s2">level and they will do so in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.539" end="00:50:59.369" style="s2">extremely unaccountable manner because</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.539" end="00:51:02.579" style="s2">once hyper consumer practices start</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.369" end="00:51:03.689" style="s2">touching the stuff and I&#39;m walking you</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.579" end="00:51:04.519" style="s2">through it you see what its gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.689" end="00:51:08.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.519" end="00:51:12.700" style="s2">so now aside from making mutants and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.119" end="00:51:14.260" style="s2">more the rock Johnson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.700" end="00:51:16.089" style="s2">we&#39;re going to cross the threshold where</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.260" end="00:51:19.030" style="s2">we start figuring out if we play with</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.089" end="00:51:23.530" style="s2">this gene we can start also changing our</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.030" end="00:51:24.430" style="s2">brains I call this the gene drive of the</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.430" end="00:51:29.730" style="s2">so like the Tower of the Bell but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:33.250" style="s2">the gene drive of about the humanists</p>

<p begin="00:51:35.950" end="00:51:39.670" style="s2">quantizing belief so they can prove that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.390" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">there is no divine they want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.670" end="00:51:44.799" style="s2">oh well I have modified the gene which</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:46.540" style="s2">has changed your connectome and so all</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.799" end="00:51:50.109" style="s2">of your freewill is actually just an</p>

<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:53:02.260" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna explain to you why so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.470" end="00:53:04.869" style="s2">just assume that you and myself and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.260" end="00:53:06.220" style="s2">everyone we know they are baseline Homo</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.869" end="00:53:08.770" style="s2">sapiens right there</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.220" end="00:53:11.790" style="s2">they&#39;re the homo sapiens who derived</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.770" end="00:53:14.920" style="s2">organically from the evolution process</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.790" end="00:53:17.710" style="s2">and now we have what I&#39;m going to call</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.920" end="00:53:19.059" style="s2">neurological derivatives so those</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.710" end="00:53:21.250" style="s2">neurological derivatives that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.059" end="00:53:24.099" style="s2">focus on our emotions let&#39;s start there</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.250" end="00:53:26.560" style="s2">right so I have emotions a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.099" end="00:53:29.890" style="s2">sensitive guy and I feel stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.560" end="00:53:32.650" style="s2">do stuff and it affects my behavior I</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.890" end="00:53:34.150" style="s2">get my hand oh my god fuck or I see</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.650" end="00:53:35.670" style="s2">something sad and I cry whatever I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.150" end="00:53:38.170" style="s2">emotions right I&#39;m gonna start here</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.670" end="00:53:41.680" style="s2">these emotions determine social</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.170" end="00:53:43.720" style="s2">interactions so if I emote to you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:45.850" style="s2">mad it&#39;s gonna change the outcome of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.720" end="00:53:47.290" style="s2">social interaction and if you emote with</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.850" end="00:53:49.240" style="s2">a smile it&#39;s gonna change the outcome of</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.290" end="00:53:52.440" style="s2">the social interactions so these drive</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.240" end="00:53:54.340" style="s2">these these social interactions we</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.440" end="00:53:56.440" style="s2">collaboratively figure out which ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.340" end="00:53:58.240" style="s2">are good and which ones are bad and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.440" end="00:53:59.950" style="s2">come up with a reward system which ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.240" end="00:54:00.940" style="s2">we want to promote and which ones we</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.950" end="00:54:03.790" style="s2">want to get rid of and we call that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.940" end="00:54:05.830" style="s2">culture so these are like efficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.790" end="00:54:07.390" style="s2">we&#39;re building right and this in turn</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.830" end="00:54:09.670" style="s2">leads the morality because culture isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.390" end="00:54:11.770" style="s2">enough culture is just for the present</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.670" end="00:54:13.630" style="s2">for the operational generation</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.770" end="00:54:14.950" style="s2">generation it&#39;s live only I want to take</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.630" end="00:54:17.320" style="s2">my lessons learned here and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.950" end="00:54:19.120" style="s2">preserve them through time I want my</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.320" end="00:54:21.100" style="s2">kids to have some of these cultural</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.120" end="00:54:22.600" style="s2">mores as well because there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.100" end="00:54:24.130" style="s2">pretty good efficiencies here I figured</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.600" end="00:54:26.590" style="s2">out so you don&#39;t have to fall into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.130" end="00:54:29.380" style="s2">common pit traps around it slow so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.590" end="00:54:32.230" style="s2">want to bake this in right which is 10</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.380" end="00:54:33.910" style="s2">leads to ethics which is the exploration</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.230" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">of all of this stuff and how they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.910" end="00:54:38.620" style="s2">related so after that when you get the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:42.070" style="s2">ethics and we keep examining you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.620" end="00:54:43.270" style="s2">what is but if you know so all of these</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.070" end="00:54:45.070" style="s2">things were doing these neurological</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.270" end="00:54:47.800" style="s2">derivatives were engaging in we actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.070" end="00:54:52.360" style="s2">deeply depend upon for our base ability</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.800" end="00:54:54.220" style="s2">to communicate and these arguably lead</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.360" end="00:54:55.990" style="s2">into the civil structures we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.220" end="00:54:58.810" style="s2">designing aid our neurological</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.990" end="00:55:03.100" style="s2">derivatives they absolutely form</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.810" end="00:55:05.380" style="s2">religion legality the system of who owns</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.100" end="00:55:07.980" style="s2">what what is fair what is not fair</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.380" end="00:55:11.110" style="s2">finance - who do I owe can I even</p>

<p begin="00:55:12.910" end="00:55:18.430" style="s2">towards the science itself</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.970" end="00:55:20.680" style="s2">can I a super brain out there trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.430" end="00:55:22.660" style="s2">figure out reality well I mean bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.680" end="00:55:25.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t send rocket ships in the space</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.660" end="00:55:28.150" style="s2">right so so instead of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.720" end="00:55:31.990" style="s2">civilization as a byproduct of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.150" end="00:55:34.660" style="s2">activity which human action homo</p>

<p begin="00:55:34.660" end="00:55:39.510" style="s2">do instead I look at civilization as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.680" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.510" end="00:55:45.510" style="s2">of our neurological derivatives these</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:47.220" style="s2">are the things we come up with and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.510" end="00:55:49.370" style="s2">structure of these things are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.220" end="00:55:53.400" style="s2">dependent upon all of us having the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.370" end="00:55:55.590" style="s2">these because the moment you start</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.400" end="00:55:57.930" style="s2">introducing people who don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.590" end="00:56:00.140" style="s2">same emotions as everyone else the rest</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.930" end="00:56:03.480" style="s2">of this shit doesn&#39;t even make sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.140" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">so if I strike fear from your emotional</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.480" end="00:56:07.950" style="s2">capacity and I apply that to an entire</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:09.690" style="s2">nation you&#39;re gonna come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.950" end="00:56:11.700" style="s2">culture and a morality and an ethic</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.690" end="00:56:13.410" style="s2">system that is fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.700" end="00:56:15.150" style="s2">than everyone else and as a result</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.410" end="00:56:16.890" style="s2">upstream or downstream you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.150" end="00:56:20.580" style="s2">totally different religions and totally</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.890" end="00:56:22.740" style="s2">different legal systems so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.580" end="00:56:26.130" style="s2">baseline we&#39;ve all had the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.740" end="00:56:31.380" style="s2">having this shared part right here we</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.130" end="00:56:33.660" style="s2">all have roughly the same emotions of</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.380" end="00:56:35.460" style="s2">course within here each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.660" end="00:56:37.650" style="s2">develop their own models and assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.460" end="00:56:41.490" style="s2">traditions and projections but it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.650" end="00:56:43.350" style="s2">derivative of this so what happens if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.490" end="00:56:48.230" style="s2">start fucking with this because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.350" end="00:56:50.370" style="s2">making these well let&#39;s find out</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.230" end="00:56:53.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a baseline human that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.370" end="00:56:55.830" style="s2">exploring and oh no it&#39;s the ultra</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.130" end="00:56:58.110" style="s2">humanist eco clave these people are the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.830" end="00:57:01.020" style="s2">that&#39;s let&#39;s imagine a hilarious future</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.110" end="00:57:02.580" style="s2">where the blue church has the shit</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.020" end="00:57:05.520" style="s2">kicked out of them and they lick their</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.580" end="00:57:07.830" style="s2">wounds and run away they realize that</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.520" end="00:57:10.620" style="s2">perhaps trying to teach people about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.830" end="00:57:12.750" style="s2">values of their enlightenment ordeals is</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.620" end="00:57:15.120" style="s2">a bit too expensive and risky so instead</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.750" end="00:57:18.930" style="s2">they just start coding they&#39;re at those</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.120" end="00:57:20.550" style="s2">into people at the genomic level why</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.930" end="00:57:23.820" style="s2">deal with propaganda if I can make</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.550" end="00:57:25.800" style="s2">drones that reflect everything I want so</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.820" end="00:57:27.330" style="s2">now I got these humans who are afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.800" end="00:57:29.130" style="s2">touch trees because they might harm them</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.330" end="00:57:30.330" style="s2">they don&#39;t you know they don&#39;t want to</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.770" end="00:57:42.180" style="s2">so I can then fulfill whatever my</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:45.440" style="s2">ideology is so now I&#39;m taking what the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.180" end="00:57:48.270" style="s2">baseline humans have made by modifying</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.440" end="00:57:50.610" style="s2">the genome and then the connectome and</p>

<p begin="01:00:12.260" end="01:00:19.380" style="s2">22 before us it&#39;s bring the Neanderthals</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.510" end="01:00:22.589" style="s2">back why not now I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.380" end="01:00:24.750" style="s2">successfully made my point here now I</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.589" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">guess all that remains is how true is</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.750" end="01:00:29.460" style="s2">any of this how am I taking this little</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:31.980" style="s2">cast 9 thing and extrapolating all of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.460" end="01:00:34.020" style="s2">these possibilities maybe I just have an</p>

<p begin="01:00:34.020" end="01:00:41.240" style="s2">that&#39;s fair so let&#39;s look at what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.230" end="01:00:43.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing this is the Neanderthals</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.240" end="01:00:43.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve already made them there&#39;s 6,000 of</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.650" end="01:00:48.030" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.950" end="01:00:49.950" style="s2">you brought Neanderthal brains back it</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.030" end="01:00:52.200" style="s2">took a long nap but brought them back</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.950" end="01:00:56.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve all seen Jurassic Park you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.200" end="01:00:58.369" style="s2">you get the it the DNA from the from the</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.730" end="01:01:00.960" style="s2">mosquito right it&#39;s trapped in the amber</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.369" end="01:01:02.849" style="s2">put it in the stem cell no way to go</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.960" end="01:01:05.339" style="s2">right well that&#39;s what we did here we</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.849" end="01:01:08.130" style="s2">went to a went to a Neanderthal exhibit</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.339" end="01:01:11.130" style="s2">scrape some DNA off the bones plug the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.130" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">DNA into human stem cell with the help</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.130" end="01:01:16.230" style="s2">of CRISPR and we were able to then</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:18.630" style="s2">induce stem cell into a neural cell to</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.230" end="01:01:20.550" style="s2">make these brain organoids and oh by the</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.630" end="01:01:24.420" style="s2">way we&#39;ve attached those brain organoids</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.550" end="01:01:28.589" style="s2">to robots and they walk around in their</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.420" end="01:01:31.829" style="s2">little robot chassis so we&#39;re here I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.589" end="01:01:33.119" style="s2">been here since 2018 and I&#39;ll take you</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.829" end="01:01:34.410" style="s2">if anybody ever wants to see the lab</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.119" end="01:01:39.240" style="s2">I&#39;ll take you just let me know I&#39;ll walk</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.410" end="01:01:42.510" style="s2">in there so we&#39;re here all right so we</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.240" end="01:01:46.470" style="s2">have one we have one clave of this wild</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.510" end="01:01:50.730" style="s2">crazy thing I&#39;m talking about this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.470" end="01:01:54.569" style="s2">the sector layout of all of the AI</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.730" end="01:01:57.089" style="s2">startups in Israel which is just one</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.569" end="01:01:59.310" style="s2">country right these are this is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.089" end="01:02:01.290" style="s2">ecosystem AI research and startups that</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.310" end="01:02:03.420" style="s2">are already going down highlighted in</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.290" end="01:02:05.780" style="s2">green is every sector that will</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.420" end="01:02:09.319" style="s2">influence everything I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.780" end="01:02:13.770" style="s2">that&#39;s damn near half if not over half</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.319" end="01:02:17.300" style="s2">so again one country American is way</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.770" end="01:02:19.900" style="s2">bigger euro zone&#39;s much bigger Russia&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.300" end="01:02:21.819" style="s2">they fucked up and then I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.900" end="01:02:23.140" style="s2">they&#39;ll ever recover but the Chinese are</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.819" end="01:02:25.420" style="s2">certainly looking in this stuff too</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.140" end="01:02:27.249" style="s2">because the thing about genomics is</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.420" end="01:02:30.910" style="s2">actually data problem it&#39;s not so much a</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.249" end="01:02:34.299" style="s2">chemistry problem so any advancement</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.910" end="01:02:35.499" style="s2">from here will tip the scales into the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.299" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">future I&#39;m talking about an</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.499" end="01:02:40.329" style="s2">uncontrollable fashion so the instinct</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:42.309" style="s2">is to kind of dig your heels you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.329" end="01:02:44.049" style="s2">say ah this is crazy I want nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.309" end="01:02:46.839" style="s2">do I&#39;m gonna fight it I&#39;m gonna fight</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.049" end="01:02:48.460" style="s2">all this stuff and God do I have a shot</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.839" end="01:02:51.450" style="s2">at it man trying to fight this stuff you</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.460" end="01:02:54.670" style="s2">know fucking lose it&#39;s a tidal wave of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.450" end="01:02:58.079" style="s2">incentives you&#39;re gonna have a good</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.670" end="01:03:02.559" style="s2">flight and make yourself feel good but</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.079" end="01:03:06.779" style="s2">lives are dolphins man what if what are</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.559" end="01:03:09.160" style="s2">you gonna do um kind of defeatist but</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.779" end="01:03:12.880" style="s2">wrap it up don&#39;t let your memes be</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.160" end="01:03:18.099" style="s2">dreams let your memes become jeans and</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.880" end="01:03:27.960" style="s2">you&#39;re all doing that&#39;s it that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.099" end="01:03:31.630" style="s2">got sorry for the nightmare sorcs wow</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.960" end="01:03:36.220" style="s2">thank you so much Pat that was quite the</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.630" end="01:03:38.559" style="s2">journey all right</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.220" end="01:03:41.259" style="s2">it&#39;s 935 right now Pat where you get to</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.559" end="01:03:44.019" style="s2">stay for another half hour in a bit mmm</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.259" end="01:03:46.809" style="s2">cool so this we&#39;re gonna switch over to</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.019" end="01:03:48.339" style="s2">questions now so hopefully you guys have</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.809" end="01:03:50.769" style="s2">prepared some feel free to throw them in</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.339" end="01:03:55.119" style="s2">the chat I&#39;m gonna start by warming Pat</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.769" end="01:03:56.980" style="s2">up with a with a few of my own and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.119" end="01:04:00.009" style="s2">I can start reading the ones in the chat</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.980" end="01:04:02.890" style="s2">so the one that&#39;s top of mind right now</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.009" end="01:04:05.349" style="s2">is can you speak a little bit more to</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.890" end="01:04:08.410" style="s2">what you think the timeline for this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.349" end="01:04:10.180" style="s2">like is there a Moore&#39;s Law equivalent</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.410" end="01:04:13.059" style="s2">for synthetic biology is this gonna hit</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.180" end="01:04:15.130" style="s2">some exponential curve like in the next</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.059" end="01:04:16.660" style="s2">few years and I&#39;m just gonna blow up is</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.130" end="01:04:19.690" style="s2">it a hundred years like he said earlier</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.660" end="01:04:23.440" style="s2">what&#39;s the story it never goes Kerswell</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.690" end="01:04:25.420" style="s2">in the productive forces behind it will</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.440" end="01:04:28.599" style="s2">definitely start going exponential the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.420" end="01:04:33.300" style="s2">demand for it will go exponential but</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.599" end="01:04:38.010" style="s2">once you break the gene drive of Babel</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.300" end="01:04:38.760" style="s2">Plateau everything plateaus over that so</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.010" end="01:04:40.440" style="s2">because you&#39;ll be dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.760" end="01:04:46.680" style="s2">fragmented societies that are no longer</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.440" end="01:04:54.600" style="s2">able to communicate with you have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.680" end="01:04:58.430" style="s2">sense of actual time lengths based on</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.600" end="01:04:58.430" style="s2">the Neanderthal work I&#39;ve to</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.950" end="01:05:06.320" style="s2">improvements in CRISPR are on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.330" end="01:05:09.030" style="s2">timeline the AI is getting better and</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.320" end="01:05:11.460" style="s2">again we&#39;re actually able to use the</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.030" end="01:05:13.590" style="s2">brains we grow to make the AI better too</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.460" end="01:05:15.420" style="s2">which is enhancing things pretty</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.590" end="01:05:19.170" style="s2">significantly as I I&#39;d look after the</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.420" end="01:05:22.530" style="s2">years easy 50 years okay so this this</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.170" end="01:05:25.530" style="s2">segues to another question it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.530" end="01:05:26.610" style="s2">a central assumption for at least the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.530" end="01:05:29.030" style="s2">section where you were talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.610" end="01:05:31.500" style="s2">economic efficiency curves was</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.030" end="01:05:33.330" style="s2">assumptions that the economy is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.500" end="01:05:37.230" style="s2">fundamentally similar to the way it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.330" end="01:05:40.220" style="s2">today do you think we could enter some</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.230" end="01:05:42.810" style="s2">sort of post capitalist realm that might</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.220" end="01:05:47.940" style="s2">change your projections based on that</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.810" end="01:05:50.070" style="s2">assumption so many years I mean if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.940" end="01:05:53.190" style="s2">if we&#39;re okay with lining signs this up</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.070" end="01:05:57.720" style="s2">and chaining them and beating them then</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.190" end="01:06:01.380" style="s2">yeah you don&#39;t have to pay but if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.720" end="01:06:02.040" style="s2">need to if you need to recoup from your</p>

<p begin="01:08:38.530" end="01:08:42.010" style="s2">which was a relief to look at history</p>

<p begin="01:09:05.710" end="01:09:11.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the only answer I have there all</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.700" end="01:09:13.670" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.740" end="01:09:16.760" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna start reading some of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.670" end="01:09:21.170" style="s2">questions in the chat we have one from</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.760" end="01:09:25.100" style="s2">Marshall that I was asked to read is it</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.170" end="01:09:30.790" style="s2">possible to aerosolize CRISPR yes right</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.100" end="01:09:35.480" style="s2">now it is currently the the transmission</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.790" end="01:09:41.180" style="s2">vehicle is very unstable but it can be</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.480" end="01:09:42.530" style="s2">aerosolized the instability of it it</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.180" end="01:09:43.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get you the results you&#39;re one</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.530" end="01:09:45.470" style="s2">however that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.850" end="01:09:46.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t really go for aerosolized</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.470" end="01:09:51.860" style="s2">approaches unless you&#39;re like super</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.970" end="01:09:53.390" style="s2">close to single Rachel do you want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.860" end="01:09:56.510" style="s2">unmute yourself and read your question</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.390" end="01:09:59.270" style="s2">yes I&#39;m what you&#39;re talking about a few</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.510" end="01:10:02.510" style="s2">minutes ago do you think about all</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.270" end="01:10:05.390" style="s2">battles start with petty conflicts of</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.510" end="01:10:07.540" style="s2">Belcher bridge and then triple down and</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.390" end="01:10:10.910" style="s2">that we&#39;re all just kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.540" end="01:10:14.660" style="s2">mechanisms and there are bears when they</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.910" end="01:10:16.280" style="s2">invite yes I think I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.660" end="01:10:19.850" style="s2">primarily in competition with one</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.280" end="01:10:22.670" style="s2">another and they are iterating their</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.850" end="01:10:24.230" style="s2">knowledge of humanity to rope in more</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.670" end="01:10:26.480" style="s2">and more people with or without their</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.230" end="01:10:29.420" style="s2">permission I think that&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.480" end="01:10:32.210" style="s2">most accurate description of their</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.420" end="01:10:34.480" style="s2">behavior of that particular task of</p>

<p begin="01:10:39.330" end="01:10:48.220" style="s2">alright key do you want to meet yourself</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.910" end="01:10:50.140" style="s2">and read your question no I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.220" end="01:10:51.090" style="s2">scared to but I&#39;ll do it anyways I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.140" end="01:10:53.860" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.090" end="01:10:56.350" style="s2">no it&#39;s great it&#39;s actually a lot of fun</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.860" end="01:10:58.060" style="s2">when you add four timelines I&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.350" end="01:11:00.100" style="s2">maybe it already happened I&#39;m kidding</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.060" end="01:11:06.790" style="s2">I&#39;m joking I&#39;m totally joking I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.100" end="01:11:08.650" style="s2">really joking thank you so can you I</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.790" end="01:11:10.390" style="s2">just wrote can you speculate on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.650" end="01:11:14.740" style="s2">reversal of entropy and I only ask that</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.390" end="01:11:16.480" style="s2">because I&#39;m always fascinated by Isaac</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.740" end="01:11:20.920" style="s2">Asimov&#39;s really short story called the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.480" end="01:11:22.090" style="s2">last question um so I just I would love</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.920" end="01:11:23.410" style="s2">to hear your thoughts on because there</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.090" end="01:11:24.970" style="s2">was someone else who spoke about like</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.410" end="01:11:29.080" style="s2">gods of chaos somewhere and I was like</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.970" end="01:11:31.000" style="s2">that&#39;s hilarious um so yeah I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.080" end="01:11:33.760" style="s2">hear your thoughts that is certainly the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.000" end="01:11:36.280" style="s2">heart of the matter yes we are certainly</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.760" end="01:11:38.170" style="s2">enslaved to entropy and it&#39;s the only uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.280" end="01:11:40.540" style="s2">people ask me all the time do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.170" end="01:11:43.840" style="s2">believe in the God and I&#39;m like entropy</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.540" end="01:11:46.120" style="s2">has all the properties that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.840" end="01:11:48.040" style="s2">divine so accurately it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.120" end="01:11:49.480" style="s2">only thing that the British Victorians</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.040" end="01:11:53.410" style="s2">actually put out there that was so</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.480" end="01:11:55.060" style="s2">goddamn predictive entropy and reversing</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.410" end="01:11:57.430" style="s2">it that is the Holy Grail</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.060" end="01:12:00.010" style="s2">that&#39;s basically whatever was looking</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.430" end="01:12:01.600" style="s2">for that kind of unaccountable future</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.010" end="01:12:03.220" style="s2">where you get free everything you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.600" end="01:12:05.770" style="s2">have to be you know you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.220" end="01:12:08.590" style="s2">resolve your conflict at all that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.770" end="01:12:14.470" style="s2">dream of reversing entropy at least from</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.590" end="01:12:18.400" style="s2">the human standpoint scientifically I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.470" end="01:12:21.310" style="s2">struggled in it for a long time the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.400" end="01:12:25.690" style="s2">arrow of time for example being so</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.310" end="01:12:27.340" style="s2">predominant is it&#39;s indicative of I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.690" end="01:12:29.190" style="s2">think of just running a thought</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.340" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">experiment if enter people is reversible</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.190" end="01:12:32.620" style="s2">so what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:34.390" style="s2">symmetrical time that&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.620" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">you&#39;re saying you&#39;re saying I can take</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.390" end="01:12:39.190" style="s2">time in the positive and now I can make</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:41.650" style="s2">it go back to the negative I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.190" end="01:12:43.030" style="s2">about purely symmetrical time so if you</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.650" end="01:12:45.330" style="s2">have a symmetrical time then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.030" end="01:12:47.440" style="s2">talking equilibriums so any type of</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.330" end="01:12:48.610" style="s2">positive time event that would happen</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:50.830" style="s2">there would be in a corresponding</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.610" end="01:12:51.070" style="s2">negative eventual time and eventually</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.830" end="01:13:01.770" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.070" end="01:13:04.210" style="s2">hit zero entropy it looks like nothing</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.770" end="01:13:06.130" style="s2">there&#39;s an absolute nothingness because</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.210" end="01:13:08.409" style="s2">there is no energy all energy that can</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.130" end="01:13:10.599" style="s2">happen gets reversed so you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.409" end="01:13:12.989" style="s2">about any possible universe that can</p>

<p begin="01:15:07.390" end="01:15:11.550" style="s2">about going into a desert turns out we</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.070" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">have historical examples to look at</p>

<p begin="01:15:52.090" end="01:15:55.150" style="s2">going to fundamentally change our</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.530" end="01:16:14.710" style="s2">so I believe if you solve the the Astro</p>

<p begin="01:16:14.710" end="01:16:18.520" style="s2">necessary incentives for people to give</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.390" end="01:16:22.320" style="s2">a shit about space and the easiest way</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.520" end="01:16:25.000" style="s2">to do that is to make space labor cheap</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.320" end="01:16:27.700" style="s2">but when a space leavin look like well</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.000" end="01:16:29.770" style="s2">we could be space labor if zero-gravity</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.700" end="01:16:32.170" style="s2">didn&#39;t trash us every five seconds we</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.770" end="01:16:32.970" style="s2">were up there but I already showed you</p>

<p begin="01:16:32.970" end="01:16:40.060" style="s2">those are real 6,000 of them oh we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.820" end="01:16:42.250" style="s2">already sent some into space why we send</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.060" end="01:16:44.860" style="s2">him into space because we want to evolve</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.250" end="01:16:48.420" style="s2">them to survive space so that they can</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.860" end="01:16:51.150" style="s2">be the processing units for space labor</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.420" end="01:16:54.900" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re sending them up there</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.150" end="01:16:57.670" style="s2">we&#39;ll see how the research goes but I</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.900" end="01:17:01.900" style="s2">intend to build a very large fleet I</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.670" end="01:17:04.090" style="s2">need at least to 3 million to 3 million</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.900" end="01:17:06.700" style="s2">of these goddamn robots and I will be</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.090" end="01:17:08.230" style="s2">able to start grabbing these asteroids</p>

<p begin="01:17:10.390" end="01:17:14.560" style="s2">to get the you got to get the incentives</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.430" end="01:17:16.210" style="s2">all lined up it&#39;s it&#39;s about it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.560" end="01:17:17.749" style="s2">at this point it&#39;s still about tricking</p>

<p begin="01:17:17.749" end="01:17:22.009" style="s2">them into a place where their incentives</p>

<p begin="01:18:04.959" end="01:18:12.829" style="s2">earlier you mentioned getting off the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.609" end="01:18:14.239" style="s2">planet immediately is the way to well I</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.829" end="01:18:16.789" style="s2">don&#39;t even know why you were telling</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.239" end="01:18:20.449" style="s2">people to go see me but that was the</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.789" end="01:18:24.589" style="s2">advice yeah so my question is so you get</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.449" end="01:18:26.599" style="s2">off the planet how does that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.589" end="01:18:30.979" style="s2">hearing an echo in my own voice I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.599" end="01:18:32.149" style="s2">gonna take that off the societal</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.979" end="01:18:33.379" style="s2">patterns the humans of SCYTL patterns</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.149" end="01:18:35.629" style="s2">are gonna follow that right we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.379" end="01:18:37.789" style="s2">we&#39;re just gonna continue going into</p>

<p begin="01:18:37.789" end="01:18:41.539" style="s2">to be us and we&#39;re not gonna change</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.619" end="01:18:42.739" style="s2">well CRISPR is gonna change like how you</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.539" end="01:18:44.689" style="s2">are and we can survive space and all</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.739" end="01:18:46.369" style="s2">that kind of stuff like we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.689" end="01:18:48.559" style="s2">gonna be humans those patterns are</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.369" end="01:18:51.799" style="s2">something to be there um what&#39;s the end</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.559" end="01:18:53.809" style="s2">goal right so the the reason why the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.799" end="01:18:57.079" style="s2">space domain is so important is because</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.809" end="01:18:59.119" style="s2">if we do not do this all of our genomes</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.079" end="01:19:02.739" style="s2">will be homogenized for the sake of</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.119" end="01:19:05.689" style="s2">hyper consumerism we will have either</p>

<p begin="01:19:05.689" end="01:19:09.529" style="s2">capabilities and then we&#39;ll have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.999" end="01:19:11.839" style="s2">rest of the consumer base will have a</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.529" end="01:19:15.169" style="s2">very specific genome to maximize their</p>

<p begin="01:19:15.169" end="01:19:20.659" style="s2">point there is no humans there&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="01:21:55.900" end="01:21:59.949" style="s2">certainly painted a very horrifying</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.610" end="01:22:01.809" style="s2">picture this entire time and I tried to</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.949" end="01:22:07.840" style="s2">spice it up with occasional bits of</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.809" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">black humor but the it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.840" end="01:22:12.010" style="s2">initially sold in the horror that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.480" end="01:22:14.260" style="s2">presenting it&#39;s going to be sold as the</p>

<p begin="01:22:35.710" end="01:22:41.469" style="s2">you&#39;ll see horror stories which are</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.809" end="01:22:43.510" style="s2">happening now because it is unknown to</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.469" end="01:22:45.400" style="s2">us and eventually those horror stories</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.510" end="01:22:47.590" style="s2">will go away they&#39;ll be antiques and</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.400" end="01:22:49.780" style="s2">you&#39;ll have the right side a history</p>

<p begin="01:22:49.780" end="01:22:52.690" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.230" end="01:22:54.670" style="s2">horror stories come back but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.690" end="01:22:56.469" style="s2">much more informed and they&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="01:22:56.469" end="01:22:59.800" style="s2">actually gone through so you won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.239" end="01:23:01.780" style="s2">you will be trying to put a boundary</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.800" end="01:23:04.150" style="s2">around the unknown you&#39;ll be saying hey</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.780" end="01:23:06.429" style="s2">man this crispr thing kind of fucked up</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.150" end="01:23:09.159" style="s2">this person I know and then those who</p>

<p begin="01:23:09.159" end="01:23:13.690" style="s2">political fuel the future effectively so</p>

<p begin="01:23:13.690" end="01:23:18.320" style="s2">does it misunderstand the complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.429" end="01:23:21.890" style="s2">the genome that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.320" end="01:23:23.980" style="s2">the genome is the byproduct of four</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.890" end="01:23:29.750" style="s2">billion years of winner-take-all</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.980" end="01:23:32.900" style="s2">selection and the level of complexity</p>

<p begin="01:23:44.030" end="01:23:49.340" style="s2">so much so that a lot of the early</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.739" end="01:23:52.070" style="s2">CRISPR bio hackers are getting terrible</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.340" end="01:23:54.410" style="s2">forms of cancer because it&#39;s so goddamn</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.070" end="01:23:56.180" style="s2">complicated you mess up your gene once</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.410" end="01:23:58.489" style="s2">and there he goes Stage five Auto cancer</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.180" end="01:23:59.870" style="s2">you&#39;re fuckin done for and those those</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.489" end="01:24:02.750" style="s2">reports are being suppressed by the way</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.870" end="01:24:05.870" style="s2">if you dig you&#39;ll find them so the early</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.750" end="01:24:07.969" style="s2">adopters just like again I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.870" end="01:24:10.100" style="s2">CRISPR as a selection mechanism the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.969" end="01:24:14.000" style="s2">way breeding is a selection mechanism so</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.100" end="01:24:16.790" style="s2">early adopters breeding is bloody stuff</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.000" end="01:24:19.130" style="s2">brutal birthing process is painful the</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.790" end="01:24:21.469" style="s2">the mating competition is brutal every</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.130" end="01:24:23.570" style="s2">part of it is a very carnal experience</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.469" end="01:24:25.960" style="s2">and this will be no different the the</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.570" end="01:24:29.630" style="s2">early adopters will most certainly</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.960" end="01:24:32.510" style="s2">experience their fair share of being a</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.630" end="01:24:34.550" style="s2">loser in the selection game and some of</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.510" end="01:24:37.310" style="s2">them will win but there&#39;s gonna be a big</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.550" end="01:24:38.989" style="s2">body count for sure and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.310" end="01:24:41.680" style="s2">purely rooted in ignorance of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.989" end="01:24:41.680" style="s2">complexity of it</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.710" end="01:24:55.309" style="s2">all right or approach being the end of</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.500" end="01:24:57.429" style="s2">the hour now I just want to thank Pat</p>

<p begin="01:24:57.429" end="01:25:03.530" style="s2">I guess one kind of open question for</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.349" end="01:25:06.289" style="s2">you now is what&#39;s part two what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:25:06.289" end="01:25:11.539" style="s2">like the entropy thing because that goes</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.269" end="01:25:12.949" style="s2">into my other pet projects of quantum</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.539" end="01:25:14.659" style="s2">gravity that I&#39;ve been tinkering with</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.949" end="01:25:17.960" style="s2">way too long</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.690" end="01:25:26.329" style="s2">concluded something along those lines so</p>

<p begin="01:25:26.329" end="01:25:29.449" style="s2">I think I&#39;ll talk about that that might</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.769" end="01:25:32.650" style="s2">be relevant sooner rather than later</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.449" end="01:25:34.369" style="s2">I don&#39;t know throw some suggestions uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.650" end="01:25:35.929" style="s2">pretty good on my feet</p>
