<p begin="00:00:10.030" end="00:00:14.620" style="s2">notion of thinking about this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.680" end="00:00:18.670" style="s2">faith as being groundedness being</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.620" end="00:00:21.450" style="s2">solidity as being oriented the word the</p>

<p begin="00:00:21.450" end="00:00:27.759" style="s2">agentic yeah like turning in the word</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.689" end="00:00:30.340" style="s2">meaning like the move moving it from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.759" end="00:00:33.130" style="s2">semantic domain into the nursing of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.340" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">means to an end right into the faith has</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.130" end="00:00:42.399" style="s2">something about that which is has a as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:47.109" style="s2">well-founded reliable means to an end</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.399" end="00:00:48.370" style="s2">mmm-hmm yeah it&#39;s so funny maybe think</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.109" end="00:00:53.949" style="s2">about it like if you if you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.370" end="00:00:56.649" style="s2">transposition in that direction a like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.949" end="00:00:58.089" style="s2">basketball player mmm a truly masterful</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.649" end="00:00:59.859" style="s2">basketball player you&#39;ve seen certain</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.089" end="00:01:02.190" style="s2">circumstances when they shoot a shot and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.859" end="00:01:04.180" style="s2">they just turn around and walk away</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.190" end="00:01:06.100" style="s2">because they know well before the ball</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.180" end="00:01:09.040" style="s2">is hit the hoop that it&#39;s going in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.100" end="00:01:10.600" style="s2">that&#39;s faith yeah it&#39;s the faith of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.040" end="00:01:11.770" style="s2">master knowing that their tool will do</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.600" end="00:01:13.149" style="s2">with the tool is intended that their</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.770" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">will will carry itself out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.149" end="00:01:20.890" style="s2">with artistry and a certain elegance</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:23.140" style="s2">because the competence is just there</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.890" end="00:01:24.070" style="s2">like they just know that feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.140" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">like that&#39;s getting in the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.070" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">direction how&#39;s that landing for you I</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.740" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">like parts of it and I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.229" end="00:01:38.590" style="s2">sort of open up other parts of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:40.149" style="s2">because the thing that concerns me and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.590" end="00:01:42.009" style="s2">what you said let me say what concerns</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.149" end="00:01:47.320" style="s2">me and then let me say what I liked what</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.009" end="00:01:48.729" style="s2">landed for me what concerns me is part</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.320" end="00:01:52.180" style="s2">of that historical narrative was also</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.729" end="00:01:56.649" style="s2">the shift with Luther right and you get</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.180" end="00:02:02.590" style="s2">the shift towards sort of willful</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.649" end="00:02:05.469" style="s2">assertion that and that God is also a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.590" end="00:02:07.869" style="s2">purely willing agent willing in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.469" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">sense not of wanting but of actively</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.869" end="00:02:13.540" style="s2">enforcing his will on the world the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:16.510" style="s2">imposition position notion mmm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.540" end="00:02:19.480" style="s2">and so and and we know some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.510" end="00:02:21.090" style="s2">dangerous offshoots of this which is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.480" end="00:02:22.530" style="s2">idea of faith has sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.090" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">you know almost a magical will</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.530" end="00:02:26.580" style="s2">imposition of your will on the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:29.099" style="s2">you&#39;ll just sort of will the world to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.580" end="00:02:30.420" style="s2">what you want it to be and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.099" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">think you want to put your finger on</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.420" end="00:02:33.870" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think you want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">because I know what we discussed before</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.870" end="00:02:38.970" style="s2">yeah so so there&#39;s so let me be thrown</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">in front of the Met where that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.970" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">my mind as you&#39;re talking and they both</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:43.799" style="s2">have to do with water so one has to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:45.180" style="s2">with the notion of a kayak in the river</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.799" end="00:02:47.819" style="s2">the other one is a surfer on a surfboard</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.180" end="00:02:51.870" style="s2">yeah yeah and I think there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.819" end="00:02:54.510" style="s2">big distinction between a surfer who</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.870" end="00:02:57.269" style="s2">really has this sense that he is going</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.510" end="00:02:59.549" style="s2">to out paddled the ocean you know his</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.269" end="00:03:02.190" style="s2">will is the thing right that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.549" end="00:03:03.989" style="s2">matter of almost like a brutal forcing</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.190" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">of mastery on the natural environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.989" end="00:03:07.170" style="s2">the ocean is a great example because in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">most cases this just straight up isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.170" end="00:03:09.900" style="s2">gonna happen to be a good surfer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:13.739" style="s2">first and foremost you&#39;ve learned that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.900" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">lesson that primarily your</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.739" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">responsibility is sensitivity to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">aware of the flows that you&#39;re enmeshed</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">in right right and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.790" style="s2">about your choice he&#39;s like a trim tab</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">in the in the Bucky fuller sense there</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.790" end="00:03:28.139" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an opening as a pun</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a place where your choice makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.139" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">a difference that you&#39;re your will has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:36.450" style="s2">place in the larger context and that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:38.880" style="s2">then then faith is this sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.450" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">being held in surfing it literally is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.880" end="00:03:43.319" style="s2">called being in the pocket right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:44.519" style="s2">yeah literally be to know how to sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.319" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">what&#39;s happening around you and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.519" end="00:03:47.430" style="s2">respond to what&#39;s happening in a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:50.609" style="s2">that you are held in the pocket it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.430" end="00:03:51.959" style="s2">very wu-wei sensibility right right</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.609" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.959" end="00:03:56.549" style="s2">direction okay that&#39;s very much in line</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:03:59.450" style="s2">with what I was thinking when I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.549" end="00:04:02.639" style="s2">trying to propose this idea of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.450" end="00:04:04.650" style="s2">dynamic sense of continuity of contact</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.639" end="00:04:06.389" style="s2">with an unfolding process which of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.650" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">course is exactly what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.389" end="00:04:09.959" style="s2">the surf law and then there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:11.549" style="s2">brought in an extra dimension which you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.959" end="00:04:13.769" style="s2">often do wonderfully with your with your</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.549" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">visualizations I love the way you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.769" end="00:04:17.340" style="s2">that by the way you will be articulating</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">something conceptually you&#39;ll bring it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.340" end="00:04:21.720" style="s2">into a visual metaphor and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:23.550" style="s2">visual metaphor unfolds unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.720" end="00:04:25.620" style="s2">something in the phenomenology that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.550" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t immediately referenced in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:29.430" style="s2">concept because you brought up this idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.320" style="s2">of like the pocket and finding the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.430" end="00:04:33.180" style="s2">spot right it&#39;s nice to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.320" end="00:04:35.010" style="s2">again by the way it&#39;s been too long yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.180" end="00:04:38.370" style="s2">I agree</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.010" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">I like it a lot too and so I like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.370" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">I&#39;d like iiiii cuz you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:49.170" style="s2">being a martial artist Tai Chi Chuan and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:04:50.460" style="s2">stuff like that they&#39;re like it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.170" end="00:04:51.720" style="s2">of its of course getting into a flow</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.460" end="00:04:54.210" style="s2">State</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.720" end="00:04:56.670" style="s2">but part of its also getting into like</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.210" end="00:04:59.060" style="s2">you said getting into the pocket so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.670" end="00:05:02.100" style="s2">take it that like there&#39;s there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.060" end="00:05:03.720" style="s2">a there&#39;s a normativity to faith if</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.100" end="00:05:05.640" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me like you can do it you</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.720" end="00:05:08.700" style="s2">can do it better or worse you can think</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.640" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">of the surfer you know maintaining sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.700" end="00:05:13.800" style="s2">of a continuity of contact with the wave</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:16.350" style="s2">but they&#39;re sort of clumsy right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.800" end="00:05:17.670" style="s2">then you the one who gets if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.350" end="00:05:19.170" style="s2">allow me a tournament been working on</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.670" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">you know gets an optimal grip on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.170" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">situation right and they find that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:25.920" style="s2">reciprocity with the worlds right</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:28.920" style="s2">there&#39;s that deep sort about one minute</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.920" end="00:05:30.330" style="s2">and then they have a sense of right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.920" end="00:05:32.580" style="s2">it&#39;s not something you know even with</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.330" end="00:05:33.810" style="s2">the power of a skill I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.580" end="00:05:36.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a knowing at a much deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.810" end="00:05:38.190" style="s2">you you know that you you you have this</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.330" end="00:05:41.550" style="s2">sense of a deep kind of conformity and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.190" end="00:05:44.640" style="s2">at one MIT with things that yeah gives</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.550" end="00:05:47.640" style="s2">you the sense that you&#39;re in you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.640" end="00:05:50.940" style="s2">that sweet spot with respect to how</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.640" end="00:05:52.290" style="s2">something is unfolded is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.940" end="00:05:53.790" style="s2">what you&#39;re putting your finger on yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.290" end="00:05:55.230" style="s2">absolutely I really like the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.790" end="00:05:57.060" style="s2">you highlight that notion of n1 men</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.230" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">because it is different my first-person</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.060" end="00:06:01.170" style="s2">experience when I&#39;m in the circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:03.570" style="s2">I guess that sense that sense of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.170" end="00:06:07.710" style="s2">being and dropping away and an extension</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.570" end="00:06:09.210" style="s2">and a sensitivity and you know and of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.710" end="00:06:10.710" style="s2">course the classic example is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.210" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">moment that you are aware of it or</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.710" end="00:06:14.340" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about it or you get in</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:17.310" style="s2">your head you&#39;re not in it anymore right</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.340" end="00:06:19.290" style="s2">and that&#39;s important right in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.310" end="00:06:21.480" style="s2">context of this notion of propositional</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.290" end="00:06:23.910" style="s2">well that&#39;s exactly right so there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.480" end="00:06:24.870" style="s2">things I want to talk about there one is</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.910" end="00:06:27.540" style="s2">exactly that because I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.870" end="00:06:29.910" style="s2">interested as you know and dialectic and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.540" end="00:06:33.090" style="s2">how it affords deal logos I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.910" end="00:06:35.430" style="s2">in about this this you know this</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.090" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">interplay between dropping in I&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.430" end="00:06:39.030" style="s2">your metaphor it&#39;s it&#39;s a good one and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:41.490" style="s2">then maybe I&#39;ll use my metaphor stepping</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.030" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">back and looking at and right and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.490" end="00:06:46.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of higher order place you</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:48.660" style="s2">can get there - yes that&#39;s got its own</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.440" end="00:06:50.430" style="s2">sweet spot right absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.660" end="00:06:52.170" style="s2">absolutely completely in fact you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.430" end="00:06:53.910" style="s2">again I just had the first-person</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.170" end="00:06:56.070" style="s2">experience so there&#39;s like a middle spot</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.910" end="00:06:57.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a bad place the drop shot of both</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.070" end="00:06:58.980" style="s2">and there&#39;s this really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.660" end="00:07:00.420" style="s2">thing where you&#39;re like actually in both</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.980" end="00:07:02.730" style="s2">of those places and they really do</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.420" end="00:07:08.940" style="s2">support each other yes yes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.730" end="00:07:10.920" style="s2">the kind of faith in dialectic that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.940" end="00:07:12.570" style="s2">see in the Platonic dialogues I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.920" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">reading a really good book I kept naming</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.570" end="00:07:16.980" style="s2">the name of the author&#39;s name starts</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:18.210" style="s2">with an R I&#39;ll call Sookie I think I</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.980" end="00:07:20.340" style="s2">might be getting it wrong it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.210" end="00:07:23.640" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s Platonism guy sent it to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.340" end="00:07:26.330" style="s2">and he&#39;s unpacking this whole thing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.640" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">because Plato thought that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.330" end="00:07:31.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep kind of faith in</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:32.910" style="s2">dialectic and Plato because and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.080" end="00:07:35.490" style="s2">confederal argues that when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.910" end="00:07:37.800" style="s2">this process you altima can&#39;t put it</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.490" end="00:07:40.020" style="s2">into words which sounds odd for</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.800" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">dialectic right but his whole point is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.020" end="00:07:44.610" style="s2">you you do this so something catches</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:47.460" style="s2">fire right that is ultimately non</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.610" end="00:07:48.570" style="s2">propositional but nevertheless that</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.460" end="00:07:50.910" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you can just do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.570" end="00:07:52.710" style="s2">you want there is a normativity there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.910" end="00:07:56.490" style="s2">there is this there is this guiding</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:57.780" style="s2">massive a yeah yeah yeah yeah again</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.490" end="00:07:59.010" style="s2">Haig&#39;s absolutely disputed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.780" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">beautiful it&#39;s like you could say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.010" end="00:08:04.530" style="s2">even like am hmm this new ship of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:06.600" style="s2">conformity that there&#39;s a shape there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.530" end="00:08:08.490" style="s2">a shape to it there is a shape that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.600" end="00:08:11.310" style="s2">all there is to it maybe if you know if</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.490" end="00:08:12.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t grab a ball like this then you</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.310" end="00:08:13.830" style="s2">were not going to be successful in</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.600" end="00:08:15.390" style="s2">holding the ball like if you hold it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.830" end="00:08:18.510" style="s2">like this it&#39;s gonna slide up your hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.390" end="00:08:20.460" style="s2">was that yeah that&#39;s the optimum of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.510" end="00:08:25.169" style="s2">gripping again the dynamic yeah the more</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.460" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">gripping so that brings me to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.169" end="00:08:29.160" style="s2">the other other point I wanted to we</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">don&#39;t have to get to it immediately but</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.160" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">I want to try and situate that in terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:39.510" style="s2">of again the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:42.419" style="s2">religion this idea because I want to add</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.510" end="00:08:44.400" style="s2">one more dance to it absolutely very</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.419" end="00:08:46.860" style="s2">powerful and I&#39;m seeing it unfold in</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.400" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">real time actually okay great because</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.860" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">the one more thing I would want to add</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:53.220" style="s2">to that which i think is implicit</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:55.560" style="s2">especially if the surfer right is</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.220" end="00:08:58.589" style="s2">getting an optimal grip on a continually</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.560" end="00:09:00.930" style="s2">shifting situation is the surfer is also</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.589" end="00:09:03.149" style="s2">going through some kind of transfer</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.930" end="00:09:05.220" style="s2">process now in the surfing situations</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.149" end="00:09:07.740" style="s2">its transformation of theirs but their</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.220" end="00:09:09.240" style="s2">skillset in their sensitivity but what</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.740" end="00:09:10.290" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about I think when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.240" end="00:09:12.089" style="s2">talking about the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.290" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">religion is a much more profound and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.089" end="00:09:19.410" style="s2">comprehensive transformation and so what</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:21.620" style="s2">I mean is for discussion is taking this</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.410" end="00:09:24.510" style="s2">notion we&#39;re starting to craft of faith</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.620" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">but then saying but what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.510" end="00:09:28.860" style="s2">like when it&#39;s a faith that&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:31.950" style="s2">you through this much more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.860" end="00:09:33.630" style="s2">and profound transformation does it does</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.950" end="00:09:34.890" style="s2">that make sense as a question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.630" end="00:09:37.230" style="s2">absolutely let me just try throw</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.890" end="00:09:38.610" style="s2">something out that occurs to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.230" end="00:09:40.440" style="s2">apologize that this is a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.610" end="00:09:43.260" style="s2">topical but yeah I&#39;m gonna use the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.440" end="00:09:45.270" style="s2">coronaviruses or the no that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.260" end="00:09:46.230" style="s2">unfolding medic crisis as I&#39;m referring</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.270" end="00:09:48.870" style="s2">to it because you have to think about a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.230" end="00:09:51.540" style="s2">lot of stuff besides just a virus yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.870" end="00:09:54.180" style="s2">in this context of faith in this context</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.540" end="00:09:55.740" style="s2">of religion yeah and it&#39;s really quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.180" end="00:09:57.660" style="s2">fascinating actually it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.740" end="00:09:59.370" style="s2">mirror reflection of the Black Plague</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.660" end="00:10:06.180" style="s2">yes you and I talked about this last</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.370" end="00:10:08.220" style="s2">time yeah yeah so here&#39;s here&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.180" end="00:10:11.100" style="s2">going to happen at least in some places</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.220" end="00:10:12.450" style="s2">in some context is that some people will</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.100" end="00:10:14.610" style="s2">take faith in this sense that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.450" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">talking about that&#39;s just to say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.610" end="00:10:22.529" style="s2">they will find a way to come into a how</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:25.410" style="s2">do you say it a dynamic conformity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.529" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">yeah with what is really unfolded yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.410" end="00:10:29.520" style="s2">which we should say that they will make</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:31.380" style="s2">good choices they will they will make</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.520" end="00:10:32.910" style="s2">choices that are right in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.380" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">to the reality that they find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.910" end="00:10:38.790" style="s2">in and to who they are aren&#39;t the place</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:41.160" style="s2">that they are at in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.790" end="00:10:42.600" style="s2">themselves to their own bodies to to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.160" end="00:10:44.730" style="s2">people who they are with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.600" end="00:10:46.890" style="s2">relationships that they are near and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.730" end="00:10:47.850" style="s2">in fact in extending it and if you find</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.890" end="00:10:48.870" style="s2">out whether this is happening in real</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.850" end="00:10:50.579" style="s2">time for example in many many</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.870" end="00:10:51.930" style="s2">communities around the world or the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.579" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">beginning to realize that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.930" end="00:10:56.279" style="s2">help that they need we&#39;ll only in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:59.339" style="s2">candolyn be found among the people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.279" end="00:11:00.750" style="s2">they are nearby right and to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.339" end="00:11:01.980" style="s2">to which you and what I&#39;m saying is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.750" end="00:11:04.740" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a discovery of what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.980" end="00:11:06.270" style="s2">in fact actually real mm-hmm that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.740" end="00:11:09.450" style="s2">reality it is simply the reality that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.270" end="00:11:12.450" style="s2">a context like this to be able to rely</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.450" end="00:11:14.490" style="s2">on your neighbors is a very a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.450" end="00:11:16.110" style="s2">strategy it&#39;s a good place to be yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.490" end="00:11:19.589" style="s2">and to be able to be relied on by your</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.110" end="00:11:22.110" style="s2">neighbors is a good place to be yes just</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.589" end="00:11:24.209" style="s2">remember we&#39;re not trivial yet all these</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.110" end="00:11:25.649" style="s2">things exactly good faith competence</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.209" end="00:11:26.910" style="s2">integrity trustworthiness all these sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.649" end="00:11:30.330" style="s2">of things that are old-school virtues</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.910" end="00:11:32.100" style="s2">for good reasons as our friend Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.330" end="00:11:35.700" style="s2">Peterson sort of famously tried to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.100" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">hammer into the consciousness hmm that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.700" end="00:11:40.050" style="s2">is a coming to faith thread that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:41.279" style="s2">building of an actual capacity to do so</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.050" end="00:11:43.050" style="s2">all right now it&#39;s not the hope that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:45.089" style="s2">exists but the learning the relearning</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.050" end="00:11:47.459" style="s2">and the many ways does the rediscovery</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.089" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">of what it means to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.459" end="00:11:51.959" style="s2">integrity and what it means to be able</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:53.370" style="s2">to have trustworthiness and and and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.959" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">to do so across a larger group of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.370" end="00:11:57.300" style="s2">how to be how to be a neighbor to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:11:59.459" style="s2">neighborly and to be a good neighbor in</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.300" end="00:12:01.800" style="s2">the context of crisis is an embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.459" end="00:12:05.160" style="s2">of this faith that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.800" end="00:12:09.390" style="s2">in in a larger fashion I&#39;m on a larger</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.160" end="00:12:10.950" style="s2">body and the the beautiful thing about</p>
