<p begin="00:00:00.949" end="00:00:06.240" style="s2">all right today&#39;s video today I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.810" end="00:00:08.460" style="s2">to talk about information I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:09.929" style="s2">talk about something more complex and</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.460" end="00:00:11.250" style="s2">I&#39;m like okay we need to break this down</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">so that I don&#39;t want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.250" end="00:00:17.640" style="s2">something for 15 minutes information is</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.740" end="00:00:21.330" style="s2">very powerful it&#39;s why we have in need</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.640" end="00:00:23.789" style="s2">the want to say media that&#39;s wrong the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.330" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">like news papers and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.789" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">report the news reporters that but that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:30.119" style="s2">even that has of course become an</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.560" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">entertainment industry and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.119" end="00:00:33.899" style="s2">trust it less and less and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">that Trump is in all this all this fake</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.899" end="00:00:41.100" style="s2">news business and but he has a point</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:42.989" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to know what is true and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.100" end="00:00:44.789" style="s2">is not but that&#39;s not exactly what he</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.989" end="00:00:48.390" style="s2">say and he&#39;s like anything against me is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.789" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">false we need to be able to have access</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.390" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">to information that we can trust where</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:55.020" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to have the same debate</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:56.910" style="s2">over and over and over again because we</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.020" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">can look at it and say is it true or is</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.910" end="00:01:02.520" style="s2">it not true because even if you research</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:04.650" style="s2">everything even if you&#39;re the best</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.520" end="00:01:07.020" style="s2">researcher on the planet when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.650" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">talking to somebody else policymakers</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.020" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">your cousin it Thanksgiving unless they</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">know the information it&#39;s not helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">argue with them like you&#39;re because they</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily trust your information</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">so having one database of information</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">that we can trust empowers us and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">unleashes humanity&#39;s potential in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:34.170" style="s2">of areas so what we need from</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:36.420" style="s2">information as everyday citizens and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.170" end="00:01:38.009" style="s2">people is trust for the information we</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.420" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">need to know be able to know is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.009" end="00:01:42.290" style="s2">trustworthy or not is it frumpy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be different for different</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.290" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">areas study like peer reviewed for like</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">science but also okay well why aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">these things peer reviewed what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">missing from the peer reviewed journals</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">is also really important because that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">brings the politics into it but as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">able to understand and organize the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">information I&#39;m realizing I&#39;m two</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">minutes in and haven&#39;t gotten very far</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:05.310" style="s2">on this list of things to talk about we</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:08.599" style="s2">need it to be organized the information</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.310" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">so that it&#39;s usable we need it to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.599" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">available to anyone who needs it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">that means it also needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.840" end="00:02:17.490" style="s2">understandable</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:20.190" style="s2">so if it&#39;s just a big database crap of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.490" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">numbers that nobody wants to use then I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.190" end="00:02:23.130" style="s2">mean that can still empower people if</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">they know they have access to it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.130" end="00:02:27.510" style="s2">it&#39;s trustworthy but it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:30.840" style="s2">as having infographics and having things</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.510" end="00:02:34.050" style="s2">that can make it actually accessible to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.840" end="00:02:36.750" style="s2">everyone and we all benefit from that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.050" end="00:02:38.880" style="s2">the areas that I want to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.750" end="00:02:40.350" style="s2">information this isn&#39;t one big project</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.880" end="00:02:42.090" style="s2">these would all be individual and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.350" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">possibly dozens of individuals under</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.090" end="00:02:46.740" style="s2">every heading health and science is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">huge one that&#39;s my area economics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.740" end="00:02:53.100" style="s2">understanding the system of of trade and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">and all of that history it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.100" end="00:02:57.420" style="s2">strong point but I like storytelling and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:03:01.800" style="s2">time liens and to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.420" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">visually what is happening politics what</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">our politicians say and do these things</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:07.170" style="s2">are all out there they&#39;re public</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">knowledge but they&#39;re not organized so</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.170" end="00:03:11.070" style="s2">we can&#39;t use it because we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:12.630" style="s2">the same like Trump himself is like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.070" end="00:03:14.190" style="s2">said this I didn&#39;t say he argues with</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.630" end="00:03:17.100" style="s2">himself like he&#39;ll say one thing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.190" end="00:03:18.780" style="s2">then unsay it the next time the law</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.100" end="00:03:20.430" style="s2">which I had actually looked that far</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.780" end="00:03:21.990" style="s2">into like that&#39;s that we&#39;re wrong right</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.430" end="00:03:23.640" style="s2">and goes because the laws can be change</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.990" end="00:03:26.670" style="s2">but understanding the law the law is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.640" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">written having that and then what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.670" end="00:03:32.730" style="s2">means so that it&#39;s accessible to people</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">with the information available ready to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.730" end="00:03:37.800" style="s2">go that we&#39;ve we have it you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">ten years in the future we have access</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.800" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">to these things people can invent and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:46.800" style="s2">create and discover new things much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">efficiently when we&#39;re not having to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.800" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">read design that wheel every time you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.620" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">don&#39;t have to start with ok so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.540" end="00:03:53.880" style="s2">all the information that&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:55.250" style="s2">because no matter what it is someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.880" end="00:03:57.450" style="s2">already compiled and if they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.250" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">then you can compile it make it</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.450" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">available for future people that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:05.190" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have it and making that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:07.800" style="s2">process easy and hopefully enjoyable so</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.190" end="00:04:09.210" style="s2">that it&#39;s not a slog to get through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.800" end="00:04:11.160" style="s2">information it&#39;s on a slog if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.210" end="00:04:12.570" style="s2">first person there table to add - you</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.160" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">don&#39;t have to add absolutely everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.570" end="00:04:16.920" style="s2">you have to add what you would need in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:19.799" style="s2">way the algorithms help you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.920" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">is it trustworthy is it because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.799" end="00:04:27.570" style="s2">decided on those older video one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:28.030" style="s2">biggest things it does is release this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.570" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.030" end="00:04:35.020" style="s2">debate back before the internet was so</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">prevalent and IMDB was a thing although</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.020" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">I just looked it up and it&#39;s the 90s and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:39.820" style="s2">it was the thing so I was definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">still having those debates but you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.820" end="00:04:43.690" style="s2">have a debate with someone about like</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:47.500" style="s2">who starred in what movie what movie</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:49.570" style="s2">came out when and try it now any party</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.500" end="00:04:50.890" style="s2">you&#39;re at two minutes in someone&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.570" end="00:04:53.650" style="s2">google it someone&#39;s gonna get to IMDB</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.890" end="00:04:55.960" style="s2">and be like oh yeah like the there is no</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.650" end="00:04:57.610" style="s2">debate it solves and that&#39;s what I want</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.960" end="00:05:01.690" style="s2">to have access to for science for</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.610" end="00:05:02.950" style="s2">climate change for health and like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.690" end="00:05:03.880" style="s2">never going to be that easy to look it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.950" end="00:05:06.550" style="s2">up because you&#39;re looking at all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.880" end="00:05:08.410" style="s2">cancer research but like yes all of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.550" end="00:05:10.150" style="s2">cancer research says that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.410" end="00:05:11.980" style="s2">best course of treatment to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.150" end="00:05:13.000" style="s2">have access to that same level where</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.980" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be a big debate</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.000" end="00:05:20.950" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s right before you in</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">black and white and obvious grace the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.950" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">things we can create with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:26.410" style="s2">information once it&#39;s there or infinite</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:29.470" style="s2">because it&#39;s up to the individual so</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.410" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">once if you&#39;re a writer and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.470" end="00:05:33.130" style="s2">writing during a period of history you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:34.870" style="s2">have access to everything that would</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.130" end="00:05:37.770" style="s2">have been available at that time you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.870" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">even have it so that it will scan your</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.770" end="00:05:42.700" style="s2">writing and say wait you put a clock in</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">here like a alarm clock that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.700" end="00:05:49.419" style="s2">available so till this time period and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:51.220" style="s2">the biggest thing is is that work done</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.419" end="00:05:52.630" style="s2">by we don&#39;t have to keep reinventing it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.220" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to every person doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.630" end="00:05:57.220" style="s2">and have to go and research everything</p>
