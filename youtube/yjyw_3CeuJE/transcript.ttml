<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:30.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve never been to Burning Man but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:34.260" style="s2">I think I&#39;ve of course talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.390" end="00:03:37.260" style="s2">have come back with really really mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:40.590" style="s2">of zapped by it so yeah I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.260" end="00:03:44.280" style="s2">interested to hear your take on what</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.590" end="00:03:47.630" style="s2">Burning Man is it&#39;s a phenomena that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.280" end="00:03:51.270" style="s2">think actually if you experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.630" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">given all of the the frames that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.270" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">set up right and the distinctions that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:58.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve made especially given the sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:03:59.880" style="s2">that you know because basically you look</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.320" end="00:04:02.300" style="s2">at it what&#39;s Burning Man</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.880" end="00:04:07.050" style="s2">well first there&#39;s nothing literally</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.300" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">where no trees or anything and then for</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.050" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">no any no particular solid reason a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:20.850" style="s2">hundred and fifty thousand people show</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:23.130" style="s2">up and build a city and burn a man right</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.850" end="00:04:24.660" style="s2">at the end of that week and really they</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">have different themes about what the man</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.660" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">means but actually the man part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:30.360" style="s2">what makes it Burning Man is the man</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:33.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really mean anything in</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:39.090" style="s2">particular right in so many ways it</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.960" end="00:04:42.599" style="s2">seems to be this full enactment right a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.090" end="00:04:45.419" style="s2">pattern like participatory knowing right</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.599" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">right that doesn&#39;t actually have a it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.419" end="00:04:50.430" style="s2">person it&#39;s precisely what it is because</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have any propositional great</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.430" end="00:04:55.279" style="s2">right right that&#39;s cool all right</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:57.659" style="s2">there&#39;s no no sort of paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.279" end="00:05:00.029" style="s2">assertions that people have to adhere to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.659" end="00:05:02.279" style="s2">or anything like that and that&#39;s it you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.029" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">woven into the fabric of it and people</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.279" end="00:05:09.449" style="s2">show up in my in my view it&#39;s changed I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:11.610" style="s2">first went to in 1995 right and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.449" end="00:05:13.500" style="s2">I went to it I didn&#39;t even know until I</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.610" end="00:05:17.069" style="s2">went back to it four years later that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.500" end="00:05:20.909" style="s2">that&#39;s where I was um a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.069" end="00:05:22.439" style="s2">and I think now it&#39;s gotten a quiet</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.909" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">it&#39;s gotten pretty commercialized in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.439" end="00:05:26.219" style="s2">lot of different ways so it&#39;s it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:27.539" style="s2">of its luster for a lot of people if</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.219" end="00:05:29.490" style="s2">there&#39;s really broken down I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.539" end="00:05:32.669" style="s2">been there since 2012 but I was already</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.490" end="00:05:35.189" style="s2">seeing that a little bit right however I</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.669" end="00:05:38.219" style="s2">think it really does speak a lot to what</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.189" end="00:05:40.949" style="s2">you&#39;re highlighting yeah I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.219" end="00:05:43.229" style="s2">that it may it would even be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.949" end="00:05:44.789" style="s2">going there as sort of a participant</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.229" end="00:05:49.889" style="s2">observer kind of thing almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.789" end="00:05:54.149" style="s2">anthropologically to see that maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.889" end="00:05:56.490" style="s2">I mean it like so after I do the after</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.149" end="00:05:59.099" style="s2">socrates theory I have another series on</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.490" end="00:06:01.500" style="s2">the god beyond God and reinventing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.099" end="00:06:07.909" style="s2">sacred and so that might be a good</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.500" end="00:06:07.909" style="s2">excuse to go there and and and film that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.270" end="00:06:14.669" style="s2">the God beyond God and the reinvention</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.449" end="00:06:17.930" style="s2">of the sacred and the reinvention of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.669" end="00:06:21.449" style="s2">sacred yeah is that are those are those</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.440" end="00:07:03.030" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and the work I see Peter</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:05.640" style="s2">doing and this work all this for you the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.030" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">stuff I even saw it stoic on on Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.640" end="00:07:12.470" style="s2">you know with this there&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:16.500" style="s2">authentic discourse movement and I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.470" end="00:07:18.900" style="s2">it is so Socratic in a lot of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.500" end="00:07:22.440" style="s2">its functioning and in the ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.900" end="00:07:24.210" style="s2">starting to represent itself and what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.440" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">want to do is I want to take that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.210" end="00:07:28.620" style="s2">put it into dialogue with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:31.490" style="s2">really really excellent work that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.620" end="00:07:34.610" style="s2">coming out now on re understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.490" end="00:07:37.530" style="s2">diatonic dialectic we understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.610" end="00:07:39.870" style="s2">Socratic and linkus and set up a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.530" end="00:07:41.790" style="s2">dialogue between those and as I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.870" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">mentioned to you this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.790" end="00:07:46.020" style="s2">originally was sparked for a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:48.330" style="s2">I had with Jordan Hall that that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.020" end="00:07:50.940" style="s2">that&#39;s where I see something like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.330" end="00:07:54.090" style="s2">meta psycho technology that Shepherds</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.940" end="00:07:55.860" style="s2">the ecology of practices for responding</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.090" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">to the meeting crisis and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.860" end="00:08:01.320" style="s2">want to explore because that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:03.450" style="s2">the function that dialectic had and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.320" end="00:08:06.120" style="s2">whole Neoplatonic the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.450" end="00:08:08.520" style="s2">practices right dialectic was always</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.120" end="00:08:10.650" style="s2">these the sort of meta psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.520" end="00:08:14.970" style="s2">for coordinating all the other practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.650" end="00:08:17.880" style="s2">and so it&#39;s always talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.970" end="00:08:20.640" style="s2">simultaneously with the highest regard</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.880" end="00:08:22.320" style="s2">and the most frustrating lack of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.640" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">like when you&#39;re reading the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.320" end="00:08:27.240" style="s2">literature it&#39;s like they&#39;re all but of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:30.030" style="s2">course dialectic and then what but what</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.240" end="00:08:32.370" style="s2">is it how do I do it</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.030" end="00:08:34.950" style="s2">and so I&#39;m trying to get very clear on</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.370" end="00:08:37.770" style="s2">all of that and then of course put that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.950" end="00:08:39.810" style="s2">all into dialogue with all the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.770" end="00:08:41.849" style="s2">cognitive science about cognition sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.810" end="00:08:44.580" style="s2">making meaning making distributed</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.849" end="00:08:46.410" style="s2">cognition flow states within distributed</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.580" end="00:08:47.910" style="s2">cognition you know a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.410" end="00:08:50.850" style="s2">that you and I have been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.910" end="00:08:52.440" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be at the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.850" end="00:08:54.600" style="s2">new series</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.440" end="00:08:57.500" style="s2">like I said I really want to focus it in</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.600" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">also on the figure of Socrates because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.500" end="00:09:04.110" style="s2">want I want to try and tap into up here</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">hadou talked about how you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.110" end="00:09:09.500" style="s2">figure of Socrates serves this symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:12.629" style="s2">function that you don&#39;t get just with</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.500" end="00:09:14.870" style="s2">you know a theoretical representation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.629" end="00:09:18.029" style="s2">these ideas configuring it around a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.870" end="00:09:19.649" style="s2">figure who you can then interact with at</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.029" end="00:09:22.889" style="s2">least within the fictional world of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.649" end="00:09:25.019" style="s2">dialogues and other like that that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.889" end="00:09:28.139" style="s2">gives it a kind of presence and power</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.019" end="00:09:30.290" style="s2">that a purely theoretical representation</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.139" end="00:09:32.370" style="s2">won&#39;t do so that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.290" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do that and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.370" end="00:09:37.529" style="s2">the third reason is my personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:40.410" style="s2">commitment to Socrates as the hero and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.529" end="00:09:43.350" style="s2">the way I see for example on Sunday his</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.410" end="00:09:46.470" style="s2">stoicism is all about internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.350" end="00:09:48.300" style="s2">Socrates as the sage you internalize as</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.470" end="00:09:52.319" style="s2">a fundamental way of life and so again</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.300" end="00:09:55.199" style="s2">what the way this is taking off as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.319" end="00:09:57.149" style="s2">movement is again something I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.199" end="00:09:59.850" style="s2">bring in so I can also speak to it from</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.149" end="00:10:01.889" style="s2">my my own personal you know commitment</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.850" end="00:10:03.720" style="s2">and will and what the figure of Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.889" end="00:10:07.230" style="s2">has meant to me so those are sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.720" end="00:10:10.079" style="s2">three things I&#39;m going to bring in so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.230" end="00:10:12.329" style="s2">mean your work maybe we&#39;ll even have you</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.769" end="00:10:24.660" style="s2">the stuff I see with the stoic movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.569" end="00:10:27.029" style="s2">other practices though I hope to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.660" end="00:10:30.860" style="s2">some of the people who are you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.029" end="00:10:33.240" style="s2">involved with authentic relating and</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.490" end="00:14:15.570" style="s2">I know it&#39;s often translated as</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.410" end="00:14:17.070" style="s2">friendship love and that&#39;s a word that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.570" end="00:14:19.050" style="s2">comes to mind but it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.070" end="00:14:23.880" style="s2">thing as friendship there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.050" end="00:14:25.470" style="s2">else you and I were sort of talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.880" end="00:14:28.290" style="s2">about that and that text conversation I</p>

<p begin="00:14:28.290" end="00:14:32.580" style="s2">was trying to say it&#39;s it I see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.690" end="00:14:34.230" style="s2">going on and circling but when you and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.580" end="00:14:36.779" style="s2">are talking sometimes it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.230" end="00:14:38.120" style="s2">circling it&#39;s it&#39;s the folia that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.779" end="00:14:40.770" style="s2">also being there&#39;s a share</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.750" end="00:14:51.990" style="s2">want a different metaphor for rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.400" end="00:14:54.870" style="s2">than the circling metaphor I wanna I</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.990" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">wanna this metaphor right that were you</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.870" end="00:14:59.190" style="s2">know there&#39;s we&#39;re caught up in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:01.050" style="s2">dream together that&#39;s what Lee said</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.190" end="00:15:06.600" style="s2">that&#39;s how that&#39;s how it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.050" end="00:15:08.520" style="s2">that&#39;s very well said you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.600" end="00:15:10.640" style="s2">interesting for me is there&#39;s a quality</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.520" end="00:15:12.470" style="s2">to it right</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.640" end="00:15:14.450" style="s2">and like what you&#39;re saying it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.470" end="00:15:15.650" style="s2">not just you and I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.450" end="00:15:17.630" style="s2">and thoughts and feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.650" end="00:15:19.690" style="s2">experiences of just each other in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.630" end="00:15:22.460" style="s2">kind of circular</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.690" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">interaction it&#39;s not just personal</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.460" end="00:15:28.760" style="s2">intimacy that&#39;s right there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:31.280" style="s2">which we&#39;re sharing the horizon yes but</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.760" end="00:15:36.640" style="s2">part of the sharing I think is something</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.280" end="00:15:41.210" style="s2">like the experience of the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.640" end="00:15:43.400" style="s2">realizing that we&#39;re sharing yes in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.210" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">and that in that real realization is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.400" end="00:15:49.670" style="s2">like as if we kind of come to aware that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:52.250" style="s2">we&#39;re walking together facing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.670" end="00:15:53.660" style="s2">that we can&#39;t quite put words to well</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.250" end="00:15:55.670" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s it right there</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.660" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">comes down back and that&#39;s where I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.670" end="00:15:59.990" style="s2">it for me hermetically circles</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:03.410" style="s2">background because it reveals the ground</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.990" end="00:16:06.110" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly I was gonna say I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.410" end="00:16:08.210" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s a third partner right</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.110" end="00:16:10.910" style="s2">where the space of intelligibility is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.210" end="00:16:12.740" style="s2">also like it&#39;s it&#39;s playing a vital role</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.910" end="00:16:15.020" style="s2">it&#39;s disclosing itself and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.740" end="00:16:17.030" style="s2">affording right the dialogue in an</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.020" end="00:16:19.130" style="s2">important way and right so it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.030" end="00:16:20.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s this reciprocal realization</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.130" end="00:16:22.790" style="s2">happening between you and I there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.960" end="00:16:24.920" style="s2">logos that&#39;s happening between you and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.790" end="00:16:26.540" style="s2">that&#39;s in reciprocal relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.920" end="00:16:30.110" style="s2">this sort of field of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.540" end="00:16:32.360" style="s2">because it feels it feels more you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.110" end="00:16:34.820" style="s2">the the there&#39;s a great Latin word for</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.360" end="00:16:36.920" style="s2">this invent fiora inventio which covers</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.820" end="00:16:38.150" style="s2">both invention and discovery it feels</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.920" end="00:16:41.060" style="s2">like that it&#39;s not something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.150" end="00:16:42.650" style="s2">inventing it&#39;s we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.060" end="00:16:44.030" style="s2">discovering it the way you discover that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.650" end="00:16:46.190" style="s2">your table is five feet long or</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.030" end="00:16:48.740" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s more like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.190" end="00:16:51.080" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s hangs between being an</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.740" end="00:16:52.840" style="s2">invention and a discovery but at but</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.080" end="00:16:55.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what I also see in the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.840" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">dialogues right the the deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.340" end="00:17:01.100" style="s2">there&#39;s the way of the logos by means of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:03.470" style="s2">the logos right and so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.100" end="00:17:05.780" style="s2">that&#39;s again what I&#39;m trying to what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.470" end="00:17:08.660" style="s2">want to I want to get clearer on and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.780" end="00:17:10.010" style="s2">that&#39;s why I feel like burdened you last</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.660" end="00:17:12.050" style="s2">time I was just sending you these long</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.010" end="00:17:14.919" style="s2">long texts because I was struggling to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.050" end="00:17:16.659" style="s2">try and articulate this together</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.919" end="00:17:19.929" style="s2">there you go once again I just got I</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.659" end="00:17:27.789" style="s2">just wear my plugger bed I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.929" end="00:17:31.690" style="s2">we you know and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.789" end="00:17:33.460" style="s2">where I kind of got something the impact</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.690" end="00:17:36.580" style="s2">you know so on one level we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.460" end="00:17:38.140" style="s2">about you know our connection yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.580" end="00:17:41.070" style="s2">think at the same time you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.140" end="00:17:44.140" style="s2">hear this horizon of where we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.070" end="00:17:47.110" style="s2">talking about something that happens a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.140" end="00:17:49.240" style="s2">phenomenon happens right yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.110" end="00:17:51.909" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a coming into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.240" end="00:17:54.250" style="s2">dialogue from I mean the spatial</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.909" end="00:17:56.110" style="s2">metaphors can be very misleading so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.250" end="00:17:57.549" style="s2">depending on your charity here but</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.110" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of something coming into</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.549" end="00:18:03.100" style="s2">the dialogue from outside the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:05.019" style="s2">right it&#39;s coming in right and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.100" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">that&#39;s why I like the horizon in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.019" end="00:18:09.639" style="s2">sense that the horizon is also connected</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.110" end="00:18:11.380" style="s2">to the affordance of the ground that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.639" end="00:18:13.779" style="s2">suddenly opens up in front of you so</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.380" end="00:18:15.730" style="s2">that you can walk forward right and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.779" end="00:18:17.019" style="s2">reminds me again of course of Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.730" end="00:18:19.240" style="s2">idea if you&#39;re coming out of the cave</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.019" end="00:18:20.889" style="s2">right you you take a step forward you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.240" end="00:18:23.470" style="s2">blinded by the light but then your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.889" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">adjust and then you can see ground that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.470" end="00:18:27.100" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t see before so you can move</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:29.620" style="s2">forward then something that hits you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.100" end="00:18:31.210" style="s2">again and you&#39;re blinded again your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.620" end="00:18:32.950" style="s2">accommodate you can now see new ground</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.210" end="00:18:34.929" style="s2">again and that&#39;s how you do the Anegada</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.950" end="00:18:36.279" style="s2">how that&#39;s how you move out and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.929" end="00:18:38.019" style="s2">like that&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s happening when</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.279" end="00:18:39.490" style="s2">we&#39;re in this discourse right you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.019" end="00:18:42.159" style="s2">there&#39;s something happens and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.490" end="00:18:44.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a a light comes in right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.159" end="00:18:45.789" style="s2">sort of then we accommodate to it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.200" end="00:18:47.559" style="s2">that accommodation is what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.789" end="00:18:49.690" style="s2">convey by that it&#39;s coming from outside</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.559" end="00:18:52.899" style="s2">the dialogue and then as we accommodate</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.690" end="00:18:55.779" style="s2">we both simultaneously right see how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.899" end="00:18:59.049" style="s2">go forward how to move forward and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.779" end="00:19:01.990" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s a very that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.049" end="00:19:04.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a very I think central aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.990" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">the platonic dialogue that we have lost</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.500" end="00:19:10.360" style="s2">in the note we&#39;ve lost in this new more</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:12.519" style="s2">modern notion of the debate right</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.360" end="00:19:16.389" style="s2">especially that the debate and insofar</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.519" end="00:19:19.750" style="s2">as the debate has moved into right you</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.389" end="00:19:21.960" style="s2">know the the adversarial thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.750" end="00:19:24.460" style="s2">it&#39;s important for people to disagree</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.960" end="00:19:26.889" style="s2">you watched the video with Paul and I we</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.460" end="00:19:28.870" style="s2">disagree on a lot but nevertheless there</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.889" end="00:19:33.309" style="s2">was there was still that sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.870" end="00:19:35.110" style="s2">right that sense of you know it like</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.309" end="00:19:37.270" style="s2">he&#39;d have an insight have it an insight</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.110" end="00:19:39.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a sharing and then things open</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.270" end="00:19:42.130" style="s2">up and you move forward and and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.160" end="00:19:44.200" style="s2">that I this is why I&#39;m so excited right</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.860" end="00:20:23.530" style="s2">conversation you you you have a you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.050" end="00:20:28.030" style="s2">a technical yeah very technical so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.530" end="00:20:31.540" style="s2">sense I have and is deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.030" end="00:20:34.600" style="s2">Frankfurt and then some of my own work</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.540" end="00:20:36.460" style="s2">so Frankfurt distinguishes distinguishes</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.600" end="00:20:39.460" style="s2">between the lawyer and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.460" end="00:20:41.530" style="s2">artist the liar depends on your</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.460" end="00:20:43.750" style="s2">commitment to the truth that you care</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.530" end="00:20:45.400" style="s2">about the truth to affect your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.750" end="00:20:47.110" style="s2">so the lawyer gets you to believe</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.400" end="00:20:49.179" style="s2">something Susan loves you that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.110" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">true because if you believe it to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.179" end="00:20:53.470" style="s2">true that will change your behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">very predictable reliable way so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.470" end="00:20:57.340" style="s2">how the lie that&#39;s why the lie are lies</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:59.350" style="s2">because it&#39;s depending on your your</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.340" end="00:21:00.490" style="s2">commitment to the truth the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.350" end="00:21:01.990" style="s2">artist doesn&#39;t work that way the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.490" end="00:21:04.270" style="s2"> artist tries to get you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.990" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">disinterested into whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.270" end="00:21:09.010" style="s2">something is true or false and instead</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:11.080" style="s2">and this is where I sort of move be I</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.010" end="00:21:13.660" style="s2">try and draw what I think was implied by</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.080" end="00:21:16.390" style="s2">Frankfurt what I argue is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.660" end="00:21:19.000" style="s2">artist depends on the salience of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.390" end="00:21:21.910" style="s2">information how catchy it is how much it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.000" end="00:21:24.520" style="s2">sort of like will earworm and weave its</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.910" end="00:21:26.950" style="s2">way in and so the classic example I give</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.520" end="00:21:29.770" style="s2">of this is like a commercial right in</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.950" end="00:21:31.660" style="s2">which you know you&#39;re watching somebody</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.770" end="00:21:33.250" style="s2">drinking alcohol and there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.660" end="00:21:35.559" style="s2">attractive people around them and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.250" end="00:21:37.570" style="s2">know that&#39;s not true you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.559" end="00:21:39.310" style="s2">true you go into a bar you see desolate</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.570" end="00:21:41.800" style="s2">people right but but that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.310" end="00:21:42.610" style="s2">in fact they are depending on you smugly</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.800" end="00:21:44.620" style="s2">saying to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.610" end="00:21:46.900" style="s2">I know that&#39;s not true because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.620" end="00:21:50.890" style="s2">where you put aside the question of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.900" end="00:21:53.380" style="s2">truth but then what happens is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.890" end="00:21:54.760" style="s2">stimuli are still super salient to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.380" end="00:21:57.460" style="s2">there&#39;s all these attractive people</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.760" end="00:21:59.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a liquid being drunk right the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.460" end="00:22:02.620" style="s2">the lighting is beautiful and so you end</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.470" end="00:22:05.799" style="s2">up buying the alcohol precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.620" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">it was salient and salient in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.799" end="00:22:10.690" style="s2">has been disconnected from the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:13.630" style="s2">of you know your understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.690" end="00:22:16.330" style="s2">truth and so that and what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.630" end="00:22:18.910" style="s2">important for for me guy about that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.330" end="00:22:21.250" style="s2">what I see how I see that relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.910" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">the Socratic project is right</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.250" end="00:22:24.429" style="s2">constructed ease was involved with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:26.770" style="s2">natural philosophers have cared about</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.429" end="00:22:28.600" style="s2">the truth but didn&#39;t really get into you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.770" end="00:22:30.340" style="s2">know the transformative aspects of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.600" end="00:22:32.470" style="s2">and then the Sophists who were really</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.340" end="00:22:35.049" style="s2">good at manipulating salience but seem</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.470" end="00:22:37.419" style="s2">to were sort of disconnected from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.049" end="00:22:41.140" style="s2">question of truth I see Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.419" end="00:22:44.160" style="s2">trying to always keep those together so</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.140" end="00:22:48.360" style="s2">that we get transformative truth right</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.160" end="00:22:50.290" style="s2">and why that&#39;s crucial is because you</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.360" end="00:22:52.360" style="s2">well this gets into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.290" end="00:22:53.860" style="s2">philosophical enquiries but you you you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.360" end="00:22:56.110" style="s2">can&#39;t lie to yourself we use that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.860" end="00:22:57.460" style="s2">metaphor and I&#39;m kind of very critical</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.110" end="00:22:59.530" style="s2">of that metaphor because it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.460" end="00:23:00.820" style="s2">misleading metaphor because first of all</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.530" end="00:23:02.830" style="s2">you can&#39;t lie to yourself because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.820" end="00:23:04.750" style="s2">can&#39;t know some things not the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.830" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">secondly beliefs aren&#39;t things you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.750" end="00:23:09.490" style="s2">right if they&#39;re not voluntary actions</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:10.929" style="s2">so you can&#39;t lie to yourself you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.490" end="00:23:13.390" style="s2">what you can do you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.929" end="00:23:15.309" style="s2">yourself because your attention you</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.390" end="00:23:17.049" style="s2">write can be directed by you you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.309" end="00:23:19.900" style="s2">direct your attention to something and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.049" end="00:23:21.880" style="s2">make it salient but the thing is once</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.900" end="00:23:24.610" style="s2">something has been salient it then tends</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.880" end="00:23:27.340" style="s2">to catch your attention and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.610" end="00:23:29.650" style="s2">create this loop you can participate in</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.340" end="00:23:32.020" style="s2">the self-organizing nature of attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.650" end="00:23:35.890" style="s2">and how it alter salience so that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.020" end="00:23:39.040" style="s2">get dragged into right buying that</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.890" end="00:23:41.590" style="s2">particular brand of alcohol voting for</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.040" end="00:23:43.720" style="s2">this particular politician right all</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.590" end="00:23:47.290" style="s2">that kind of stuff and so I see</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.720" end="00:23:49.809" style="s2">bullshitting as anathema to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.290" end="00:23:52.030" style="s2">trying to do here and I see Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.809" end="00:23:54.160" style="s2">precisely because he explicitly rejects</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.030" end="00:23:56.470" style="s2">both the natural scientists and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.160" end="00:23:58.929" style="s2">Sophists as wanting to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.470" end="00:24:02.049" style="s2">in which the salient seeking and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.929" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">and the truth-seeking are wedded</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.049" end="00:24:06.309" style="s2">together and that&#39;s what that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:09.630" style="s2">see all the authentic discourse they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.309" end="00:24:12.360" style="s2">trying to provide an on-the-ground</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.630" end="00:24:15.490" style="s2">antidote response to the ever increasing</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.360" end="00:24:17.710" style="s2">pervasive bullshitting in our society</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.490" end="00:24:20.620" style="s2">and in our psyches and authentic</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.710" end="00:24:22.059" style="s2">discourse is a Socratic way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.620" end="00:24:23.409" style="s2">address that sorry that was a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.059" end="00:24:26.200" style="s2">speech but that&#39;s like that this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.409" end="00:24:28.299" style="s2">really central I think to too much to my</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.200" end="00:24:31.539" style="s2">to my understanding appreciation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.299" end="00:24:32.830" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in things like circling</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.539" end="00:24:35.380" style="s2">and the other authentic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.830" end="00:24:39.640" style="s2">practices wouldn&#39;t you say that you were</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.380" end="00:24:41.640" style="s2">in a certain sense and you&#39;re just for</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.640" end="00:24:45.010" style="s2">even just right now like when you said</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.640" end="00:24:47.409" style="s2">forgive my speech yeah you were I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.010" end="00:24:49.929" style="s2">you were highlighting that hey I just</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.409" end="00:24:53.020" style="s2">gave you a lot of salience Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.929" end="00:24:54.580" style="s2">however the the context in which you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.020" end="00:24:58.360" style="s2">were giving that salines from was to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.580" end="00:24:59.740" style="s2">highlight something in reality that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.360" end="00:25:02.740" style="s2">true that was important</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.740" end="00:25:07.690" style="s2">well yes I mean that&#39;s exactly right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.740" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">trying to get wet the the salience of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.690" end="00:25:16.630" style="s2">the of how I&#39;m presenting the material</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:20.890" style="s2">to what I think what is an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.630" end="00:25:21.970" style="s2">of an important aspect of the way human</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.890" end="00:25:24.520" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.970" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">human communication human communing even</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.520" end="00:25:28.120" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.549" style="s2">fraudulent communing going on between</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.120" end="00:25:33.010" style="s2">you and the people in in the alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.549" end="00:25:34.570" style="s2">commercial it&#39;s like you&#39;re sharing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.010" end="00:25:37.240" style="s2">world but you&#39;re not it&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.570" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">real world there that you&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.240" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">together and so I&#39;m trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:44.230" style="s2">salience of our discourse glued back</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:46.570" style="s2">together towards this sort of Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.230" end="00:25:48.970" style="s2">insight about you know a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.570" end="00:25:53.169" style="s2">understanding of what what dialogue can</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.970" end="00:25:58.049" style="s2">be doing for us Frank Wow okay so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.169" end="00:25:58.049" style="s2">really well a couple a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:03.940" style="s2">one is I&#39;m understanding the text even</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.299" end="00:26:05.799" style="s2">more the text that you had sent me where</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.940" end="00:26:06.130" style="s2">we were talking about are you saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.799" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.130" end="00:26:13.000" style="s2">yeah maybe what what circling is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:17.380" style="s2">right it&#39;s possibly pointing to this</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.000" end="00:26:19.630" style="s2">meta this meta psycho technology for</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.380" end="00:26:21.820" style="s2">psycho technologies yeah something</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.630" end="00:26:23.410" style="s2">essential that that in your</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.820" end="00:26:25.950" style="s2">understanding of circling and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.410" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">hearing is also that is also very much</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.950" end="00:26:31.540" style="s2">similar to your understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:32.380" style="s2">experience of Socratic dialogue exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.540" end="00:26:35.770" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.380" end="00:26:39.850" style="s2">at any any downstream psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.770" end="00:26:41.770" style="s2">that&#39;s developed if it&#39;s upstream from</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.850" end="00:26:45.010" style="s2">these two things where reality and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.770" end="00:26:48.270" style="s2">salience are me we&#39;ve fitted towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.010" end="00:26:52.590" style="s2">each other in a way that reveals more</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.270" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">reality that can be salient to us yes</p>

<p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:34.600" style="s2">if we understand it as self-realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.400" end="00:28:37.030" style="s2">and I want to hear something deeper than</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.530" end="00:29:26.620" style="s2">very much really appreciated what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.409" end="00:29:28.780" style="s2">said in our first interview and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.620" end="00:29:31.030" style="s2">been noticing myself kind of from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.780" end="00:29:33.549" style="s2">bottom up using a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.030" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">pathologies and then recognizing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.549" end="00:29:36.820" style="s2">after the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:38.669" style="s2">which I which I want to talk all about a</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.820" end="00:29:41.260" style="s2">little bit because I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.669" end="00:29:43.450" style="s2">demonstrates the impact of these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.260" end="00:29:45.940" style="s2">of conversations that are more than just</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.450" end="00:29:47.650" style="s2">figuring something intellectually out</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.940" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">though that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.650" end="00:29:56.350" style="s2">demonstrates a kind of in some way my</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:30:00.659" style="s2">term our dialogues together I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.350" end="00:30:06.549" style="s2">that in a pre reflective way I am</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.659" end="00:30:08.950" style="s2">putting things in terms that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.549" end="00:30:11.260" style="s2">used before without recognizing it until</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.950" end="00:30:13.510" style="s2">after the fact well I was keyed on</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.260" end="00:30:16.390" style="s2">something you said once and you used you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.510" end="00:30:18.340" style="s2">paused and you and you sort of unpacked</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.390" end="00:30:19.780" style="s2">it a bit then and then you moved on and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.340" end="00:30:21.340" style="s2">I can&#39;t maybe it was with David or</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.780" end="00:30:23.799" style="s2">something I&#39;ve watched some of your</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.340" end="00:30:27.250" style="s2">circling but you pause on the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.799" end="00:30:29.080" style="s2">coming to terms which which carries with</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.250" end="00:30:31.990" style="s2">it exactly what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.080" end="00:30:34.360" style="s2">like the coming to terms you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.990" end="00:30:36.760" style="s2">things to terms to intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.360" end="00:30:38.920" style="s2">discourse but there&#39;s also the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.760" end="00:30:40.330" style="s2">essential confrontation and you and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.920" end="00:30:42.520" style="s2">you need to go through a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.330" end="00:30:44.380" style="s2">to like when people say well you need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.520" end="00:30:46.780" style="s2">come to terms with this means well</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.380" end="00:30:49.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to change how you&#39;re relating</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.780" end="00:30:52.260" style="s2">and responding to this so I really</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.240" end="00:30:55.060" style="s2">enjoyed that little thing you did around</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.260" end="00:30:57.220" style="s2">May is coming to terms because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.060" end="00:31:00.330" style="s2">oh wow that&#39;s really really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.220" end="00:31:04.420" style="s2">really that&#39;s a really succinct way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.330" end="00:31:05.800" style="s2">demonstrating in you know in that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.420" end="00:31:08.070" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about I really</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.800" end="00:31:11.560" style="s2">appreciate it I like that a lot actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.070" end="00:31:15.550" style="s2">so glad I what&#39;s one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.560" end="00:31:17.170" style="s2">noticing in these and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.550" end="00:31:22.740" style="s2">get some some interesting things about</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.170" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">open enough about the the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.740" end="00:31:29.140" style="s2">in the medium that they&#39;re taking place</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:31.360" style="s2">in and in how I actually am wondering</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.140" end="00:31:33.160" style="s2">about if the way is you say our little</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:35.620" style="s2">corner of the internet yeah that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:54.670" end="00:31:58.930" style="s2">that was really great we know but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.560" end="00:32:00.250" style="s2">think I I think she would get well I</p>

<p begin="00:32:12.010" end="00:32:17.830" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.280" end="00:32:21.670" style="s2">Heidegger is really profoundly revealed</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.830" end="00:32:23.410" style="s2">which it&#39;s stunning that it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.670" end="00:32:27.580" style="s2">those things about and I noticed I like</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.410" end="00:32:30.130" style="s2">I&#39;m attracted to thinkers that have this</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.580" end="00:32:34.840" style="s2">I have this quality but would you which</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.130" end="00:32:37.480" style="s2">is they don&#39;t stop yielding that horizon</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.160" end="00:32:46.780" style="s2">appreciate about the way that tight a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.010" end="00:32:49.330" style="s2">girl talked about the age this being an</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.780" end="00:32:52.150" style="s2">age of technology</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.890" end="00:32:56.950" style="s2">understanding it&#39;s kind of to mistreat</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:33:00.040" style="s2">Heidegger if you think that he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.950" end="00:33:03.220" style="s2">about technological objects you know</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.140" end="00:34:15.730" style="s2">for something like the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.669" end="00:34:18.700" style="s2">happened right any and I think did that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.730" end="00:34:20.790" style="s2">really struck him and he he&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.700" end="00:34:23.380" style="s2">is a different understanding of being</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.790" end="00:34:24.580" style="s2">right that&#39;s going on there and maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.380" end="00:34:26.590" style="s2">was connected to that and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.580" end="00:34:28.150" style="s2">other things and where he started to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.590" end="00:34:30.610" style="s2">realize oh we are in the age of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.150" end="00:34:33.990" style="s2">technique in the age of techne</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.610" end="00:34:37.450" style="s2">our understanding of that which is is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.990" end="00:34:39.400" style="s2">being is a standing and reserved yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.450" end="00:34:42.760" style="s2">other standing reserve you very much a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.400" end="00:34:45.790" style="s2">waiting awaiting endless calculation and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.760" end="00:34:47.919" style="s2">optimization of of everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.790" end="00:34:49.690" style="s2">and one of the things that he what he</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.919" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">talks about it and this is really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.690" end="00:34:56.200" style="s2">really eerie to wake up to this in what</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:35:00.730" style="s2">because part of the waking up to it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.200" end="00:35:01.960" style="s2">to be horrified that you that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.730" end="00:35:04.230" style="s2">weren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.960" end="00:35:12.130" style="s2">sleep - and it was so concealed to you</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.230" end="00:35:15.130" style="s2">and so so a lot of our current age you</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.130" end="00:35:18.250" style="s2">could say is you know endless shopping</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.130" end="00:35:20.170" style="s2">malls Internet&#39;s right the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.250" end="00:35:23.490" style="s2">sense in which the only thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.170" end="00:35:26.710" style="s2">can wage being show themselves to us now</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.490" end="00:35:29.560" style="s2">are just things for further optimization</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.710" end="00:35:35.170" style="s2">for their own sake right yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.560" end="00:35:38.020" style="s2">and this the the the the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.170" end="00:35:40.660" style="s2">standing reserve is that their</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.020" end="00:35:44.070" style="s2">relationship to us is always one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.660" end="00:35:46.330" style="s2">service right there they&#39;re always there</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.070" end="00:35:49.180" style="s2">and we get this even on the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.330" end="00:35:50.920" style="s2">things being Natural Resources right</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.180" end="00:35:54.010" style="s2">that they&#39;re far they&#39;re fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.920" end="00:35:56.080" style="s2">ontology is how they stand in service to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.010" end="00:35:58.540" style="s2">us and I think Heidegger was right that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.080" end="00:36:00.490" style="s2">that is part of the UH the the problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.540" end="00:36:03.670" style="s2">with the Anto theological because the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.490" end="00:36:06.099" style="s2">idea of nature of fuzzers ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.670" end="00:36:08.170" style="s2">being understood in its in its</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.099" end="00:36:10.390" style="s2">relationship of being in service to us</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.170" end="00:36:13.810" style="s2">the only it exists only insofar as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.390" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">in service to us I think that&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.810" end="00:36:18.060" style="s2">fundamental because the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:20.920" style="s2">we see everything that way and that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.060" end="00:36:22.780" style="s2">like I like Harmons point about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.920" end="00:36:25.390" style="s2">right why should we think that half of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.780" end="00:36:28.420" style="s2">ontology is us right that&#39;s great like</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.390" end="00:36:31.930" style="s2">you there that&#39;s such an arrogant a sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.420" end="00:36:33.099" style="s2">of thing right and then until you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.930" end="00:36:35.680" style="s2">you know you get Heidegger&#39;s whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.099" end="00:36:37.630" style="s2">exploration of foods this is that which</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:39.220" style="s2">blooms without a purpose without a why</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.630" end="00:36:41.650" style="s2">that has no teleological</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.220" end="00:36:44.470" style="s2">and we it precisely has its being</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.650" end="00:36:46.810" style="s2">because it has no use for us right we</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.470" end="00:36:49.020" style="s2">can&#39;t find well how is that going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.810" end="00:36:51.940" style="s2">serve me and his it&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.020" end="00:36:54.790" style="s2">disclosing its being in how it is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.940" end="00:36:59.310" style="s2">going to serve you and this is why I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.790" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">sort of been trying to get to you know I</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.310" end="00:37:05.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know IIIi want to tread very</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:07.300" style="s2">lightly here but yet that there is you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.080" end="00:37:09.220" style="s2">know there&#39;s not we&#39;ve got to give up</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.300" end="00:37:12.760" style="s2">that but there&#39;s got to be a grand</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.220" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">cosmic TD ology that everything is in</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.760" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">some sir in some sense service to us</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:19.420" style="s2">personal I just think that does not</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:22.510" style="s2">comport well with the way the cosmos is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.420" end="00:37:24.550" style="s2">clearly laid out with 99.9% of it having</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.510" end="00:37:27.310" style="s2">absolutely nothing to do with us both in</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.550" end="00:37:29.050" style="s2">time and in space right so I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.310" end="00:37:31.090" style="s2">that&#39;s a ridiculous claim to make</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.050" end="00:37:34.630" style="s2">ontological II but also because of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.090" end="00:37:36.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve just said the implicit idea that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.630" end="00:37:40.390" style="s2">think that the being of things is their</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.670" end="00:37:43.270" style="s2">being in service to us is to lose is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.390" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">lose the mystery the depth the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.270" end="00:37:48.940" style="s2">things withdraw their autonomy from us</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:50.860" style="s2">right I think that&#39;s for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.940" end="00:37:54.250" style="s2">the crucial message on getting out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.860" end="00:37:56.590" style="s2">this and so too I&#39;m even I&#39;m even trying</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.250" end="00:37:57.970" style="s2">to challenge gently because I respect</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.590" end="00:38:00.160" style="s2">the people and I&#39;m in discourse with I</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.970" end="00:38:02.200" style="s2">really do but I&#39;m trying to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:05.590" style="s2">the idea of understanding meaning as</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.200" end="00:38:08.650" style="s2">purpose where purpose is this service</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.590" end="00:38:10.930" style="s2">right their service to our t loss our</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.650" end="00:38:14.340" style="s2">goal our projects</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.930" end="00:38:17.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like know if connectedness to being</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.340" end="00:38:19.570" style="s2">right and ultimately to the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.080" end="00:38:22.750" style="s2">being to sacredness can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.570" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">relationship of just how does that sing</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.750" end="00:38:28.900" style="s2">serve my goals yes sorry but that I feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:31.690" style="s2">very strongly about this because I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.900" end="00:38:33.610" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a I think that&#39;s this for</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.690" end="00:38:35.740" style="s2">me that&#39;s what I took that&#39;s what I take</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.610" end="00:38:37.660" style="s2">from heidegger&#39;s notion the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.740" end="00:38:41.500" style="s2">the being of something is it&#39;s being in</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.660" end="00:38:43.300" style="s2">service to me right totally and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.500" end="00:38:47.250" style="s2">saying about like a couple of things is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.300" end="00:38:49.780" style="s2">like I have a in in the years of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.250" end="00:38:51.130" style="s2">circling and doing it and cultivating it</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.780" end="00:38:55.030" style="s2">and trying to figure out how to teach it</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.130" end="00:38:59.530" style="s2">which is all of it has been I would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.030" end="00:38:59.740" style="s2">an experience of the opposite yes very</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.530" end="00:39:04.680" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.740" end="00:39:07.390" style="s2">yeah the collapsing of all distances</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.680" end="00:39:09.550" style="s2">right which is if you look at like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.390" end="00:39:12.460" style="s2">more technological something it is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.550" end="00:39:13.570" style="s2">more collapses distances so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.460" end="00:39:15.490" style="s2">things that Heidegger I think really</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.570" end="00:39:17.710" style="s2">points out is this interesting paradox</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.490" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">which that which is most concealed is</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.710" end="00:39:22.900" style="s2">that which is most near right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.320" end="00:39:24.670" style="s2">technology and if you notice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.900" end="00:39:27.990" style="s2">literally getting nearer and nearer and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.670" end="00:39:31.290" style="s2">nearer right like was it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.990" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">you know mascara to the chips yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.290" end="00:39:37.710" style="s2">can kind of understand what made it</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:39.720" style="s2">possible to disclose have things appear</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.710" end="00:39:42.570" style="s2">in such a way that like even my brain</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.720" end="00:39:45.060" style="s2">right become something that I can see it</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.570" end="00:39:48.589" style="s2">how how can we collapse the distance</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.060" end="00:39:51.270" style="s2">between my brain and my brain basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.589" end="00:39:53.580" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s interesting about that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.270" end="00:39:55.020" style="s2">that what did what that and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.580" end="00:40:01.080" style="s2">you&#39;re what you&#39;re talking about is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.020" end="00:40:04.140" style="s2">what that ends up concealing is one is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.080" end="00:40:07.890" style="s2">the notion of concealed miss itself yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.140" end="00:40:09.780" style="s2">a as we identify with our technology</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.890" end="00:40:11.820" style="s2">like if you touch my clothing I get</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.780" end="00:40:14.460" style="s2">offended because I&#39;m so identified with</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.820" end="00:40:16.200" style="s2">it so please continue yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.460" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">well it&#39;s kind of like if you just get</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.200" end="00:40:21.349" style="s2">another like concrete analogy imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:25.230" style="s2">imagine tomorrow you woke up and like</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.349" end="00:40:27.420" style="s2">imagine it was 1970s right this is 1970</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.230" end="00:40:30.630" style="s2">and you woke up and he still thought it</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.420" end="00:40:33.330" style="s2">was 1970 and then you went to the BART</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.630" end="00:40:37.220" style="s2">station or the bus stop and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.330" end="00:40:37.220" style="s2">watched everybody at the bus stop just</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.790" end="00:40:44.040" style="s2">look in not looking up and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.250" end="00:40:46.080" style="s2">passing each other and everyone doing it</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.040" end="00:40:47.700" style="s2">and then no one having here&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.080" end="00:40:54.570" style="s2">here&#39;s the eerie part is that no one</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.700" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">having a conversation about you probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.570" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">have thoughts like oh my god it got us</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">right yeah there&#39;s some totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:05.010" style="s2">regime that is somehow inseminated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:07.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s wiretapping and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.010" end="00:41:09.800" style="s2">around us and who we we&#39;ve some we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.080" end="00:41:14.670" style="s2">succumbed yeah that&#39;s very much the case</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.800" end="00:41:20.010" style="s2">yeah so I get that I get that so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.670" end="00:41:22.290" style="s2">very much to use a plane you term it the</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.650" end="00:41:39.119" style="s2">here I am and you know in my apartment</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.839" end="00:41:40.770" style="s2">and you know all of the objects around</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:41.369" style="s2">me are here because they&#39;re in service</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.369" end="00:41:48.180" style="s2">Yeah right and and so uh and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.569" end="00:41:50.190" style="s2">even if I hadn&#39;t but you know reading</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.180" end="00:41:55.799" style="s2">Heidegger or in this discourse would I</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.190" end="00:41:58.319" style="s2">even notice how much I&#39;ve lost the sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.799" end="00:41:59.910" style="s2">right because the only way I tend to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.319" end="00:42:03.930" style="s2">experience things not being in service</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.910" end="00:42:06.839" style="s2">and with what to me is frustration this</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.930" end="00:42:09.930" style="s2">is why this is why again why Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.839" end="00:42:12.989" style="s2">again philosophy begins in wonder wonder</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.930" end="00:42:16.380" style="s2">is the sense of oh wow that that has an</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.989" end="00:42:18.839" style="s2">existence above and beyond me and but</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.380" end="00:42:20.819" style="s2">I&#39;m not experiencing that as frustration</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.839" end="00:42:23.369" style="s2">the things aren&#39;t serving me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.819" end="00:42:26.789" style="s2">experienced it is a no-no ultimately I</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.369" end="00:42:31.079" style="s2">have to fit into this I have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.789" end="00:42:36.450" style="s2">resituated I have to hum it to this it</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.079" end="00:42:39.269" style="s2">puts a demand on me right yeah and our</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.450" end="00:42:46.049" style="s2">demand that it be immediately</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.269" end="00:42:50.989" style="s2">intelligible for it to be valid is is I</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.049" end="00:42:53.969" style="s2">think is is it starting to define a</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.989" end="00:42:56.759" style="s2">whole age I mean we now have we now have</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.969" end="00:42:57.210" style="s2">kids that this is really interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.759" end="00:43:01.049" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.210" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">we now have like a whole generation it</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.049" end="00:43:04.229" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a memory before the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:09.269" style="s2">internet yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.229" end="00:43:11.549" style="s2">and so the the I mean the internet the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.269" end="00:43:15.380" style="s2">internet by every standards of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.549" end="00:43:19.609" style="s2">ancient world as a god it&#39;s omnipresent</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.380" end="00:43:22.019" style="s2">it it it gives advice it provides</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.609" end="00:43:24.269" style="s2">massive amounts of information it</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.019" end="00:43:26.009" style="s2">directs you it gives all these normative</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.269" end="00:43:28.289" style="s2">standards because you&#39;re judged by the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.009" end="00:43:31.460" style="s2">community of the Internet if you say or</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.289" end="00:43:34.440" style="s2">do the wrong thing and yet right</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.460" end="00:43:37.499" style="s2">although that&#39;s the case that in it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.440" end="00:43:41.219" style="s2">very much a God for us the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.499" end="00:43:43.410" style="s2">idea for idolatry the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.219" end="00:43:45.539" style="s2">narcissism because that&#39;s again when</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.410" end="00:43:47.609" style="s2">everything&#39;s in if God is ultimately in</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.539" end="00:43:51.660" style="s2">service to you that&#39;s the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.609" end="00:43:53.950" style="s2">narcissism right and so all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.660" end="00:43:57.869" style="s2">transparent to us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.950" end="00:44:01.720" style="s2">in a really telling fashion so I I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.869" end="00:44:03.970" style="s2">you mean if you can see how you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.720" end="00:44:05.710" style="s2">there&#39;s all these feet well not all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.970" end="00:44:07.059" style="s2">them that&#39;s that&#39;s too grandiose but</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.710" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">many of the themes were touching upon</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.059" end="00:44:12.309" style="s2">now here they&#39;re right in that Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.000" end="00:44:15.900" style="s2">milieu right Socrates is bringing them</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.309" end="00:44:19.809" style="s2">all up right he&#39;s fact he actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.900" end="00:44:23.230" style="s2">frustrates when he actually like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.809" end="00:44:26.440" style="s2">thought yeah like he actually frustrates</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.230" end="00:44:30.069" style="s2">the people in the dialogue who command</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.440" end="00:44:32.109" style="s2">easy or demand or pretend to have you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.069" end="00:44:34.510" style="s2">know readily ready-made intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.109" end="00:44:36.040" style="s2">so I mean if you look at the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.510" end="00:44:37.960" style="s2">that are often pitched that way those</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.040" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">often be two people Gonzalez does a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.960" end="00:44:42.369" style="s2">really great job of this in his book</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:43.780" style="s2">right there&#39;s like you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.369" end="00:44:45.940" style="s2">Lyceus where he&#39;s talking to the two</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.780" end="00:44:47.980" style="s2">generals and so what you get is you get</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.940" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">one person who represents the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.980" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">authority of intuition I just know it</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:54.819" style="s2">Courage&#39;s I just know it I can just</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:57.309" style="s2">speak it right and then and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.819" end="00:44:59.290" style="s2">on the other side you you get the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.309" end="00:45:02.410" style="s2">the the student of the sophist who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.290" end="00:45:03.970" style="s2">captured some dialogue so not something</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.410" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">like that&#39;s exactly the wrong word who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.970" end="00:45:08.410" style="s2">captured some slogan or phrase not</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:10.180" style="s2">within dialogue he&#39;s just heard it from</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.410" end="00:45:12.940" style="s2">the sophist and now he has the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.180" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">definition and so Socrates is rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.940" end="00:45:17.859" style="s2">both the intuitive I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:19.750" style="s2">and the I&#39;ve defined it a gothic I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.859" end="00:45:22.630" style="s2">got the final definition and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.750" end="00:45:25.780" style="s2">frustrating both of those claims to an</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:30.700" style="s2">easy lis accessible intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.780" end="00:45:33.010" style="s2">right right and that process of enduring</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.700" end="00:45:35.920" style="s2">that frustration and returning to that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.010" end="00:45:39.790" style="s2">know in Socrates is continuing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.920" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">returning to that to the not knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.790" end="00:45:44.260" style="s2">aporia the aporia I mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:47.020" style="s2">Socrates induces and he&#39;s compared to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.260" end="00:45:49.450" style="s2">like he&#39;s compared to a stingray or a</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.020" end="00:45:51.700" style="s2">magician because you get caught up and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.450" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">you and you don&#39;t know to think about</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.700" end="00:45:54.940" style="s2">what holy what we talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:57.339" style="s2">you don&#39;t know how to go forward because</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.940" end="00:45:59.230" style="s2">you can&#39;t go forward until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.339" end="00:46:03.250" style="s2">willing to commit to a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.230" end="00:46:06.710" style="s2">yes and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.250" end="00:46:10.120" style="s2">that which you can commit to right that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.710" end="00:46:12.170" style="s2">which if you commit to it can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.120" end="00:46:12.770" style="s2">transformative in the act of committing</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.170" end="00:46:18.470" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.770" end="00:46:23.240" style="s2">I think whatever that is hmm cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.470" end="00:46:26.180" style="s2">optimized by in other words it cannot it</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.240" end="00:46:30.410" style="s2">does not reveal itself as as standing in</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.180" end="00:46:33.380" style="s2">reserve ah awaiting awaiting my</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.410" end="00:46:37.790" style="s2">calculation because and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.380" end="00:46:40.730" style="s2">the things I think that that that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.790" end="00:46:44.120" style="s2">are talking about I believe which is and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.730" end="00:46:46.100" style="s2">and it brings us back to the medium that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.120" end="00:46:46.670" style="s2">we&#39;re in right now rarely heard of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.100" end="00:46:49.640" style="s2">Internet</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.670" end="00:46:52.220" style="s2">I think it&#39;s unique and I think Reverend</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.640" end="00:46:53.720" style="s2">was wisdoms doing this I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.220" end="00:46:55.850" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this with your series I</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.720" end="00:46:59.450" style="s2">think this is an example of this is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.850" end="00:47:04.840" style="s2">place where actually technology is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.450" end="00:47:08.680" style="s2">be is not it is offering not something</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.840" end="00:47:11.630" style="s2">that leads to further enhance technology</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.680" end="00:47:16.570" style="s2">but rather its delivering something</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.630" end="00:47:20.080" style="s2">inherently untechnical right called</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.570" end="00:47:23.090" style="s2">conversations that are difficult right</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.080" end="00:47:28.010" style="s2">that that&#39;s conversations that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.090" end="00:47:31.910" style="s2">collapse distances and I would add are</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.010" end="00:47:34.130" style="s2">viewed as useless by a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.910" end="00:47:36.200" style="s2">because where&#39;s the bottom line what</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.130" end="00:47:39.170" style="s2">like where is the conclusion like who</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.200" end="00:47:40.850" style="s2">won all of those questions are I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.170" end="00:47:42.290" style="s2">they&#39;re being so deeply frustrated that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.850" end="00:47:44.570" style="s2">they&#39;re even being marginalized and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.290" end="00:47:47.540" style="s2">what&#39;s happening between us right now we</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.570" end="00:47:49.190" style="s2">I mean there is a joint file eeeh in us</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.540" end="00:47:51.260" style="s2">in that they are not going to be the</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.260" end="00:47:56.150" style="s2">are governed in our discourse right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.780" end="00:47:58.610" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s really important yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.150" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s something about that win that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.610" end="00:48:09.210" style="s2">mutual recognition of that we&#39;re both</p>

<p begin="00:48:12.840" end="00:48:18.860" style="s2">right as we&#39;re walking to it that gives</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.910" end="00:48:21.840" style="s2">the ground lies we recognize that Oh</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.920" end="00:48:40.620" style="s2">unknowingness that like that sense of</p>

<p begin="00:48:57.840" end="00:49:02.310" style="s2">on the qualitative more honest not just</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.210" end="00:49:04.560" style="s2">a quantitative more Ness all right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.310" end="00:49:06.690" style="s2">the quantitative morna&#39;s is you know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.560" end="00:49:09.150" style="s2">gather more information and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.690" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">that&#39;s more what curiosity is about</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.150" end="00:49:15.360" style="s2">whereas wonder it opens me up to new</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:17.130" style="s2">kinds of information new kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.360" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">intelligibility that&#39;s why I wonder is</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.130" end="00:49:22.710" style="s2">so much more associated with awe and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:25.650" style="s2">with insight and so the way I try to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.710" end="00:49:27.300" style="s2">this because what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.650" end="00:49:29.220" style="s2">think about it think about the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.300" end="00:49:33.390" style="s2">of this for somebody who&#39;s a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.220" end="00:49:35.190" style="s2">right because so how I try to do this as</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.390" end="00:49:36.420" style="s2">I try to make it to stick what can we</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.190" end="00:49:38.490" style="s2">have scientific theories about and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.420" end="00:49:39.540" style="s2">can we not have scientific theories</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.490" end="00:49:41.880" style="s2">about and I try to do this very</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.540" end="00:49:43.230" style="s2">carefully and so I try to make an</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.880" end="00:49:45.030" style="s2">argument I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.230" end="00:49:47.490" style="s2">episode or not that we we cannot have</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.030" end="00:49:49.470" style="s2">there is no and I mean this in</p>

<p begin="00:49:49.470" end="00:49:55.950" style="s2">to relevance there is no final</p>

<p begin="00:49:57.930" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">shocking there is no final solution to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.020" end="00:50:07.020" style="s2">what is relevant right what cause</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.180" end="00:50:37.770" style="s2">there is no essence to other then you</p>

<p begin="00:51:15.180" end="00:51:22.470" style="s2">well then explicitly arguing that there</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.630" end="00:51:25.650" style="s2">can be no definition no essence no final</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.240" end="00:51:37.020" style="s2">around I think that&#39;s also part of the</p>

<p begin="00:52:12.300" end="00:52:16.770" style="s2">I try to put that together because the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.340" end="00:52:20.370" style="s2">issue you&#39;re bringing up guy is it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:52:23.460" end="00:52:28.680" style="s2">ultimately a scientist because like how</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.850" end="00:52:31.230" style="s2">do you work how do you work in</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.680" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">sorry my phone thinks I&#39;m gay</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:40.380" style="s2">it yeah the challenge of what can I</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.589" end="00:52:42.270" style="s2">bring what can i what is it I&#39;ll use a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.380" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">stronger language what is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.270" end="00:52:46.589" style="s2">for me to bring the scientific project</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.589" end="00:52:51.420" style="s2">intelligible what sits well what is it</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.420" end="00:52:57.569" style="s2">does that very same framework tell me no</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.940" end="00:53:00.750" style="s2">this is something that right we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.569" end="00:53:06.510" style="s2">talk about as not being capturable like</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.750" end="00:53:07.980" style="s2">I I so I I resist a me like I say and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.510" end="00:53:10.920" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna use this phrase again to be</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.920" end="00:53:17.690" style="s2">like this this is this is the absence</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.890" end="00:53:22.619" style="s2">right there I want to I want to decouple</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.690" end="00:53:24.599" style="s2">the notion of sacredness from perfection</p>

<p begin="00:53:30.599" end="00:53:37.200" style="s2">of relevance and say no sacredness is</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.990" end="00:53:40.349" style="s2">about the the ongoing inexhaustible</p>

<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:53.010" style="s2">well that we use but we can never use up</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.970" end="00:53:55.530" style="s2">and that never being able to use it up</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.010" end="00:53:57.630" style="s2">it&#39;s precisely at sacredness right</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.530" end="00:54:00.089" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an aspect of it that was</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.210" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">machinery right yeah science right the</p>

<p begin="00:54:39.420" end="00:54:46.049" style="s2">supports and is even in some way</p>

<p begin="00:54:52.210" end="00:54:59.559" style="s2">so this is where I am trying to argue</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.599" end="00:55:02.499" style="s2">that there is a way of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.559" end="00:55:05.079" style="s2">sacredness by sacredness I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.499" end="00:55:07.539" style="s2">experience and then the sacred is</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.079" end="00:55:09.999" style="s2">whatever the ontological ground of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.539" end="00:55:11.440" style="s2">experience is right so that science of</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.999" end="00:55:13.210" style="s2">course can talk about sacredness in</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:16.749" style="s2">terms of this relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.210" end="00:55:20.489" style="s2">machinery and but it can also talk it</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.749" end="00:55:22.989" style="s2">could tell us right that that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.489" end="00:55:25.329" style="s2">puts us into a participatory</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.989" end="00:55:27.819" style="s2">relationship with the sacred where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.329" end="00:55:29.829" style="s2">sacred is something that I think is</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.910" end="00:56:09.700" style="s2">let&#39;s get this new notion of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.299" end="00:56:12.519" style="s2">as right as I put it as the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.700" end="00:56:15.069" style="s2">inexhaustible ground that is a perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.519" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">fount of intelligibility and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.069" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">I like the Neoplatonic notion of the one</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:22.359" style="s2">because the one is not itself</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:25.150" style="s2">intelligible it is the it is the never</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.359" end="00:56:27.369" style="s2">failing source of intelligibility but it</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.150" end="00:56:30.069" style="s2">itself resists all of our project for</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.369" end="00:56:31.099" style="s2">intelligibility price precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.069" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the ground of an</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.099" end="00:56:42.410" style="s2">eligibility right right now so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.440" end="00:56:44.210" style="s2">this one I&#39;m really getting this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.410" end="00:56:51.950" style="s2">really getting like now as we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.210" end="00:56:54.859" style="s2">is the the orientation to that which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.950" end="00:56:57.979" style="s2">worthy of orienting to yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.859" end="00:57:02.029" style="s2">she looks ultimate concern right the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.979" end="00:57:07.130" style="s2">ultimate concern is can&#39;t ever be summed</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.029" end="00:57:09.289" style="s2">up and grab the whole love in some final</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.130" end="00:57:11.930" style="s2">way but that yet it is the source of</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.289" end="00:57:15.140" style="s2">inexhaustible intelligibility right</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.930" end="00:57:19.789" style="s2">that&#39;s in and that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.140" end="00:57:22.789" style="s2">innately healthy and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.789" end="00:57:27.259" style="s2">would imagine being human in particular</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.789" end="00:57:29.630" style="s2">right this is brought you here what you</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.259" end="00:57:32.499" style="s2">think about this there&#39;s a way that the</p>

<p begin="00:57:32.499" end="00:57:42.469" style="s2">opens to reality seems to be inherently</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.349" end="00:57:46.460" style="s2">that there&#39;s something very healthy</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.469" end="00:57:50.150" style="s2">about being oriented to that which you</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.460" end="00:57:54.109" style="s2">can&#39;t completely grasp I think so like</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.150" end="00:57:58.069" style="s2">something about that sense of I know who</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.109" end="00:58:02.779" style="s2">is it Maximus the Confessor he said</p>

<p begin="00:58:13.969" end="00:58:17.960" style="s2">a coated maximus and i&#39;ve been thinking</p>

<p begin="00:58:20.719" end="00:58:28.789" style="s2">a hero in like the 700 AD sound and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.029" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">believe so yeah well maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.789" end="00:58:32.779" style="s2">earlier i&#39;m not sure</p>

<p begin="01:01:18.840" end="01:01:22.530" style="s2">and I would go and I would go to say</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.820" end="01:01:24.900" style="s2">towards your notion of health right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.530" end="01:01:27.300" style="s2">so this is and I got to talk about this</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.900" end="01:01:29.820" style="s2">later when I in the series when I talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.300" end="01:01:31.530" style="s2">about the divine double in work like</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.820" end="01:01:33.660" style="s2">Corbin and young and people like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.530" end="01:01:35.369" style="s2">until like the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.660" end="01:01:38.010" style="s2">essential self and the existential self</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.369" end="01:01:40.619" style="s2">right so I just call it has written a</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.010" end="01:01:44.700" style="s2">really beautiful book called aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.619" end="01:01:47.490" style="s2">and she talks about aspiration is when</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.700" end="01:01:49.170" style="s2">you want to acquire an identity and a</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.490" end="01:01:52.350" style="s2">set of values that you currently do not</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.170" end="01:01:54.450" style="s2">have which means those values and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.350" end="01:01:56.190" style="s2">identity can&#39;t be motivating and driving</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.450" end="01:01:57.900" style="s2">you she gives the example of someone who</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.190" end="01:02:00.570" style="s2">wants to come to love classical music</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.900" end="01:02:02.250" style="s2">who does not currently love classical</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.570" end="01:02:04.470" style="s2">music right she uses that as their</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.250" end="01:02:06.840" style="s2">thought experiment and so she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.470" end="01:02:08.490" style="s2">motivated by a love of classical music</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.840" end="01:02:09.660" style="s2">and she&#39;s not motivated by an identity</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.490" end="01:02:11.510" style="s2">that is bound to classical music</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.660" end="01:02:14.670" style="s2">precisely because that is what she lacks</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.510" end="01:02:16.530" style="s2">but she wants to become to have that</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.670" end="01:02:18.330" style="s2">identity so this is the process of that</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.530" end="01:02:19.830" style="s2">of aspiration and you can&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.330" end="01:02:21.930" style="s2">compute your way through it and infer</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.830" end="01:02:23.760" style="s2">your way through it but but then she</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.930" end="01:02:26.490" style="s2">makes an astonishingly what I think is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.760" end="01:02:29.190" style="s2">neo platonic point she says notice that</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.490" end="01:02:31.680" style="s2">if you say I can&#39;t infer my way through</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.190" end="01:02:34.770" style="s2">that I can&#39;t use you sort of standard</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:37.050" style="s2">decision metric measures right because</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.770" end="01:02:38.430" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to acquire our value I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.050" end="01:02:39.869" style="s2">have I&#39;m trying to acquire right an</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.430" end="01:02:40.890" style="s2">identity I don&#39;t have I&#39;m trying to go</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.869" end="01:02:44.400" style="s2">through some kind of transformative</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.890" end="01:02:46.500" style="s2">experience right she says if you say</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.400" end="01:02:48.270" style="s2">that&#39;s not rational precisely because</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.500" end="01:02:50.550" style="s2">you can&#39;t reason your way through it</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.270" end="01:02:52.770" style="s2">right and then I do a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.550" end="01:02:54.869" style="s2">riff on her work but here&#39;s the riff I</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.770" end="01:02:57.270" style="s2">do though I think bring out her argument</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.869" end="01:02:59.609" style="s2">if you say that the ass but that</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.270" end="01:03:02.040" style="s2">aspiration is not itself a rationally</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.609" end="01:03:03.390" style="s2">justifiable process notice what a bind</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.040" end="01:03:04.680" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get into because you</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.390" end="01:03:07.950" style="s2">know one of the things we should aspire</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.680" end="01:03:09.810" style="s2">to being more rational and if the</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.950" end="01:03:11.310" style="s2">aspiration to rationality is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.810" end="01:03:12.810" style="s2">something that it is itself can be</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.310" end="01:03:14.820" style="s2">rationally justified</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.810" end="01:03:17.490" style="s2">then rationality becomes this self</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.820" end="01:03:19.260" style="s2">undermining process right it&#39;s becomes</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.490" end="01:03:22.080" style="s2">the self undermining demand on you</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.260" end="01:03:25.020" style="s2">so she says we have to extend the notion</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.080" end="01:03:27.240" style="s2">of rationality to include this</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.020" end="01:03:29.940" style="s2">aspiration now here&#39;s why that comes</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.240" end="01:03:33.660" style="s2">back to your point we have to be in</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.940" end="01:03:35.850" style="s2">relationship that has a demand on us is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.660" end="01:03:38.840" style="s2">something that currently exceeds our</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.850" end="01:03:42.390" style="s2">value and identity in order to afford</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.840" end="01:03:46.950" style="s2">aspiration we have this when you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.390" end="01:03:52.940" style="s2">get so we have to have a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.950" end="01:03:55.950" style="s2">that has a demand on us yes okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.940" end="01:03:58.890" style="s2">that comes from something that we that</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.950" end="01:04:01.020" style="s2">does not fit into our current value</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.890" end="01:04:04.110" style="s2">structure and identity precisely because</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.020" end="01:04:06.540" style="s2">it can challenge us beyond our current</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.110" end="01:04:09.060" style="s2">values and identity to become something</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.540" end="01:04:11.700" style="s2">other than what we are it is the only</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.060" end="01:04:15.630" style="s2">real affordance of real self</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.700" end="01:04:17.730" style="s2">transcendence so there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.630" end="01:04:20.360" style="s2">like even just now in athlete ending</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.730" end="01:04:23.100" style="s2">that and I notice as you&#39;re speaking it</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.360" end="01:04:24.900" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting I can kind of feel this</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.100" end="01:04:31.230" style="s2">sense of I&#39;m right at the tip of</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.900" end="01:04:35.070" style="s2">something yes and I am not like that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.230" end="01:04:39.420" style="s2">there&#39;s some way in which what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.070" end="01:04:43.350" style="s2">speaking to is just to simply get closer</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.420" end="01:04:45.720" style="s2">to that which is we can&#39;t say in some</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.350" end="01:04:47.790" style="s2">final way yes exactly</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.720" end="01:04:49.320" style="s2">does have a call like if you look at pop</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.790" end="01:04:55.020" style="s2">I said if you just look at this as two</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.320" end="01:04:57.180" style="s2">Apes and you watch what they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.020" end="01:04:58.980" style="s2">they&#39;re really after something and what</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.180" end="01:05:03.690" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing is that there is that in</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.980" end="01:05:08.880" style="s2">some way my ID is it fair to say that</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.690" end="01:05:14.120" style="s2">like what what I how I develop right as</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.880" end="01:05:17.790" style="s2">a person as a human as a individual is</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.120" end="01:05:21.090" style="s2">is one is it is it&#39;s it&#39;s an unending</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.790" end="01:05:24.450" style="s2">project mm-hmm right and precisely</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.090" end="01:05:26.260" style="s2">because because it&#39;s the kind of project</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.450" end="01:05:32.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.260" end="01:05:37.300" style="s2">that that in its project nests in its</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.200" end="01:05:41.290" style="s2">project nests is is is to constantly be</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.300" end="01:05:43.930" style="s2">open to being called upon by that which</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.290" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">you are not yet ready to be yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.930" end="01:05:50.830" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m trying to deepen I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:53.170" style="s2">to use color to deepens on Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.830" end="01:05:56.800" style="s2">notion of that stasis right standing</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.170" end="01:05:59.590" style="s2">beyond yourself and and I think the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.800" end="01:06:01.960" style="s2">the moments where the ex stasis becomes</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.590" end="01:06:03.490" style="s2">really clear to us is when we are going</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.960" end="01:06:05.350" style="s2">through while the qualitative</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.490" end="01:06:07.420" style="s2">development the pure self transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.350" end="01:06:09.670" style="s2">look when people have when they have</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.420" end="01:06:11.470" style="s2">these the awakening experiences when</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.670" end="01:06:13.330" style="s2">they experience what I call the when</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.470" end="01:06:14.770" style="s2">they talk about like these mystical</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.330" end="01:06:16.840" style="s2">transformative experiences and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.770" end="01:06:18.880" style="s2">encounter they&#39;re really real the term</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.840" end="01:06:20.470" style="s2">I&#39;ve picked up the term I&#39;ve coined for</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.880" end="01:06:24.070" style="s2">talking about that is on to normativity</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.470" end="01:06:25.990" style="s2">right it&#39;s what happens is from known as</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.070" end="01:06:27.700" style="s2">this is the opposite notice notice how</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.990" end="01:06:29.590" style="s2">it&#39;s the opposite of everything normally</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.700" end="01:06:31.570" style="s2">this is what we do all of this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.590" end="01:06:33.220" style="s2">intelligible to me and I have an altered</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.570" end="01:06:34.990" style="s2">state of consciousness like a dream and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.220" end="01:06:35.859" style="s2">I say oh that&#39;s not real because it</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.990" end="01:06:36.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit into all this</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.859" end="01:06:38.619" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.820" end="01:06:41.050" style="s2">but notice what these experienced</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.619" end="01:06:42.730" style="s2">exactly the opposite happens they have</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.050" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">this experience and they come back and</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.730" end="01:06:50.980" style="s2">say that was real and all of this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:52.990" style="s2">real and I have to there&#39;s a demand on</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.980" end="01:06:55.510" style="s2">me because of the really real I have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.990" end="01:06:58.180" style="s2">transform myself my world my</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.510" end="01:07:01.060" style="s2">relationship so that I can come form I</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.180" end="01:07:03.400" style="s2">can conform to that really real more</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.060" end="01:07:06.609" style="s2">than I am conforming right now yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.400" end="01:07:08.380" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens and you know what 30</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.609" end="01:07:11.230" style="s2">to 40 percent of the population have</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.380" end="01:07:14.440" style="s2">these experiences and we do not have the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.230" end="01:07:16.780" style="s2">language the tradition that guides that</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.440" end="01:07:19.210" style="s2">discourse the communication patterns</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.780" end="01:07:21.340" style="s2">that give them any way to articulate in</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.210" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">both senses of that word these</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.340" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:30.300" style="s2">so they happen like portions totally and</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:33.080" style="s2">then the best how you and what they end</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.300" end="01:07:36.890" style="s2">up being is I think this is Jamie wheels</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.080" end="01:07:41.460" style="s2">latest kind of criticism of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.890" end="01:07:43.170" style="s2">psychedelic movement is I would imagine</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.460" end="01:07:45.900" style="s2">it is it fair to say that because we</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.170" end="01:07:49.110" style="s2">don&#39;t have a shared language anymore</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.900" end="01:07:52.770" style="s2">that&#39;s that where it word sensible to</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.110" end="01:07:54.990" style="s2">open up to the mystery as is is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.770" end="01:07:58.500" style="s2">which is most true right</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.990" end="01:08:02.580" style="s2">most most determinate and worthy of</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.500" end="01:08:05.400" style="s2">moving towards yeah language around it</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.580" end="01:08:09.020" style="s2">right and instead what we&#39;re inside of</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.400" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">is something like things being</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.020" end="01:08:16.109" style="s2">immediately intelligible to us based on</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:18.450" style="s2">service can you take this experience and</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.109" end="01:08:20.990" style="s2">it becomes a jewel for your narcissism</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.450" end="01:08:23.220" style="s2">and what you do is you place it on your</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.990" end="01:08:26.400" style="s2">autobiographical shelf and you point to</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.220" end="01:08:29.330" style="s2">it as evidence for the your uniqueness</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.400" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">and why you are deserving of attention</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.330" end="01:08:34.140" style="s2">because you have a uniqueness that</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:36.330" style="s2">nothing else has right and so you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.140" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">put up clothes saying like right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.330" end="01:08:40.680" style="s2">thank you my shaman just went to this</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:43.650" style="s2">earth yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.680" end="01:08:47.160" style="s2">exactly and so it gets it takes that</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.650" end="01:08:50.250" style="s2">real that real experience and it brings</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.160" end="01:08:53.759" style="s2">it into and it in frames it exactly and</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.250" end="01:08:57.180" style="s2">so what we&#39;re what what what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.759" end="01:09:02.609" style="s2">pointing to here is okay how do we I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.180" end="01:09:09.319" style="s2">hearing both both restore rejuvenate and</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.609" end="01:09:09.319" style="s2">and create and reveal the grammar that</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.799" end="01:09:16.200" style="s2">that that allows not like allows for us</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.759" end="01:09:18.299" style="s2">to one open to those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.200" end="01:09:26.040" style="s2">experiences but in a way that actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.299" end="01:09:28.560" style="s2">um they actually deepen like deepens me</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.040" end="01:09:30.990" style="s2">deepens me in the ground that I am and</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.560" end="01:09:35.390" style="s2">this I can share about it in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.990" end="01:09:35.390" style="s2">like does it in frame it and</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.350" end="01:09:42.050" style="s2">calls to you yes it costs so it</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.230" end="01:09:44.780" style="s2">increases the call right picking up on</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.050" end="01:09:46.820" style="s2">your sense of harkening yeah that also</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.780" end="01:09:49.250" style="s2">was I think an excellent thing that came</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.820" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">out in the I believe is discussion area</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.250" end="01:09:54.380" style="s2">of a David David fuller that notion of</p>

<p begin="01:10:22.190" end="01:10:26.960" style="s2">prey to narcissistically clutching to</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.710" end="01:10:29.120" style="s2">them but can we communicate with each</p>
