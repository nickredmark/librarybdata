<p begin="00:02:17.420" end="00:02:21.799" style="s2">others approach States more as</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.100" end="00:02:40.760" style="s2">relates to bigger differences I noticed</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.760" end="00:02:44.300" style="s2">stayed very experienced new and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.530" end="00:02:46.250" style="s2">emphasized phenomenology without</p>

<p begin="00:02:46.250" end="00:02:49.970" style="s2">others ventured more into abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.350" end="00:02:51.709" style="s2">were more metaphysical in your</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.970" end="00:02:53.180" style="s2">discussions across most of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.709" end="00:02:55.459" style="s2">presentations I also noticed</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.180" end="00:02:57.290" style="s2">acknowledgement of the desirability of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.459" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">more naturalistic scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.290" end="00:03:01.480" style="s2">informed post metaphysical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:03.800" style="s2">of states whether drawing from cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.480" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">neuroscience or quantum theory there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.800" end="00:03:07.640" style="s2">an emphasis on not straying too far from</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:08.900" style="s2">what can be empirically verified and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.640" end="00:03:10.610" style="s2">related to that there was also a</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.900" end="00:03:12.410" style="s2">recognition of the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.610" end="00:03:14.690" style="s2">settings from epistemological boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.410" end="00:03:16.760" style="s2">of not sliding too easily or</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.690" end="00:03:18.650" style="s2">uncritically from phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.760" end="00:03:21.170" style="s2">experience into ontological claims about</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.650" end="00:03:22.970" style="s2">reality itself so those are some primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.170" end="00:03:25.100" style="s2">takeaways that I had from listening to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.970" end="00:03:26.690" style="s2">all of you and I&#39;d like to hear what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.100" end="00:03:28.370" style="s2">have to say about that and what other</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.690" end="00:03:30.290" style="s2">distinctions you&#39;d like to make or</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.370" end="00:03:33.020" style="s2">commonalities that you noticed one thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.290" end="00:03:35.390" style="s2">I wrote down that is just a reiteration</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.020" end="00:03:38.630" style="s2">of what you said first was just to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.390" end="00:03:41.140" style="s2">sure we&#39;re talking about States or state</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.630" end="00:03:42.290" style="s2">experience I think that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.140" end="00:03:44.420" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.290" end="00:03:46.220" style="s2">gets into conflict attention because</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.420" end="00:03:47.900" style="s2">someone&#39;s talking about States and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.220" end="00:03:50.660" style="s2">someone may be talking about state</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.900" end="00:03:52.180" style="s2">experiences I think most of us spend</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.660" end="00:03:55.160" style="s2">more time talking about state</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.180" end="00:03:58.790" style="s2">experiences but if we get into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.160" end="00:04:01.870" style="s2">conversation just notice when we do if</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.790" end="00:04:05.660" style="s2">we do slip into the context of states</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.870" end="00:04:09.110" style="s2">versus state experience so for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.660" end="00:04:11.420" style="s2">by metaphor analogy I can see myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.110" end="00:04:13.850" style="s2">switching in first person second person</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.420" end="00:04:16.510" style="s2">or third person perspective that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.850" end="00:04:19.130" style="s2">experience I&#39;m having as I navigate</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.510" end="00:04:21.500" style="s2">perspectives but I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.130" end="00:04:23.900" style="s2">having I&#39;m accessing a first-person</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.500" end="00:04:25.820" style="s2">perspective state you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.900" end="00:04:28.070" style="s2">accessing a first-person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.820" end="00:04:31.430" style="s2">that would be to think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.070" end="00:04:36.370" style="s2">perspective out there so their stakes</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.430" end="00:04:40.340" style="s2">are more alike ontological fields or</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.370" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">patterns or things like things and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.340" end="00:04:44.780" style="s2">there&#39;s an experience I mean I can have</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:47.230" style="s2">the experience of being a joyful state</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.780" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s all I mean nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.230" end="00:04:51.170" style="s2">yeah I think the term state experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:52.790" style="s2">is a good one for making that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.170" end="00:04:55.130" style="s2">distinction I usually do it the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.790" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">way and say state domain when I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.130" end="00:04:59.660" style="s2">to talk about an ontological style as</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:01.340" style="s2">opposed to an experienced but state</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.660" end="00:05:02.840" style="s2">domain and State experience works pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.340" end="00:05:05.180" style="s2">good for me to make that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.840" end="00:05:07.040" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s a good point too it</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.180" end="00:05:09.470" style="s2">would have been good to have Lex here</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.040" end="00:05:11.660" style="s2">because I would have liked to ask him</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.470" end="00:05:14.600" style="s2">about that because out of all of us I</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.660" end="00:05:17.420" style="s2">think maybe he might be more prone to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.600" end="00:05:19.370" style="s2">disagree with us on that and I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.420" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">have liked to have heard what he says</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.370" end="00:05:22.390" style="s2">about some of that stuff because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:25.190" style="s2">talking about things like accessing</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.390" end="00:05:26.570" style="s2">Universal memory and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.190" end="00:05:28.520" style="s2">so I don&#39;t really know where he&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.570" end="00:05:33.070" style="s2">from on that does anyone have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.520" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">about that I&#39;m still chewing on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.070" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">distinctions that Bonnie made and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:40.280" style="s2">clearly were we can use different words</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:43.220" style="s2">for different things so it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.280" end="00:05:45.290" style="s2">important to talk about what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.220" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">distinctions are without getting caught</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.290" end="00:05:48.860" style="s2">up in what we&#39;re naming them but I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.240" end="00:05:51.020" style="s2">to ask Bonnie so you brought up for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.860" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">second third person perspective as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.020" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">state experience for me there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:58.970" style="s2">difference between I guess you would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:01.070" style="s2">the cognitive aspect of a state and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.970" end="00:06:04.130" style="s2">sort of embodied almost you could call</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.070" end="00:06:06.710" style="s2">it a view it&#39;s almost about perceptually</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.130" end="00:06:09.080" style="s2">what&#39;s turned on and off and so I can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.710" end="00:06:11.630" style="s2">an embodied way in a first-person</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.080" end="00:06:14.030" style="s2">perspective which means I can&#39;t take a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.630" end="00:06:17.210" style="s2">second person perspective like fully in</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.030" end="00:06:19.640" style="s2">that and then I can also be a normal</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.210" end="00:06:21.380" style="s2">waking state of an adult and take</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.640" end="00:06:23.060" style="s2">different perspectives cognitively but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.380" end="00:06:24.950" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m still in the same space so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.060" end="00:06:27.860" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to parse parse out the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.950" end="00:06:29.780" style="s2">two and again for me that&#39;s we said a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.860" end="00:06:32.630" style="s2">stripped of cognitive out and try to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.780" end="00:06:35.900" style="s2">more to that perceptual embodied place</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.630" end="00:06:38.540" style="s2">yeah you misunderstand that I was just</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.900" end="00:06:41.240" style="s2">using the perspectival language as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.540" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">metaphor like saying like an experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.240" end="00:06:47.810" style="s2">of being in a perspective but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.340" end="00:06:49.820" style="s2">call that a state right but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.810" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">telling it I&#39;m still trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.820" end="00:06:54.260" style="s2">distinction between state and state</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:55.400" style="s2">experience also you said takes taking</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.260" end="00:06:57.560" style="s2">the different perspectives where</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.400" end="00:06:59.150" style="s2">different state experiences to me there</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.560" end="00:07:00.590" style="s2">may be different experiences but not</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.150" end="00:07:03.740" style="s2">different yeah I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.590" end="00:07:06.169" style="s2">I&#39;m just referencing the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.740" end="00:07:09.380" style="s2">tendency to say there are states you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.169" end="00:07:11.510" style="s2">access they&#39;re out there right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.380" end="00:07:14.210" style="s2">I&#39;m saying that&#39;s different than talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.510" end="00:07:18.139" style="s2">about state experiences and to me the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.210" end="00:07:20.510" style="s2">analogy is just as a metaphor analogy is</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.139" end="00:07:23.090" style="s2">to say there are perspectives out there</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.510" end="00:07:25.240" style="s2">that you can access even if nobody has</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.090" end="00:07:28.010" style="s2">those perspectives versus having</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.240" end="00:07:31.430" style="s2">variants of taking a perspective I</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.010" end="00:07:33.470" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so much trying to define what</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.430" end="00:07:36.410" style="s2">those differences were but just to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.470" end="00:07:40.669" style="s2">aware when we&#39;re talking which one we</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.410" end="00:07:44.840" style="s2">mean so like if nobody ever dreamt would</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.669" end="00:07:47.330" style="s2">there be a dream state oh yeah yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.840" end="00:07:51.350" style="s2">just call it the dream state as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.330" end="00:07:53.180" style="s2">placeholder to abstract from all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.350" end="00:07:56.660" style="s2">times people actually experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.180" end="00:07:59.900" style="s2">dreaming and yeah the traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.660" end="00:08:06.669" style="s2">other people tend to talk about States</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.900" end="00:08:09.580" style="s2">as if they persist or are available or</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.669" end="00:08:13.100" style="s2">reified or something and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.580" end="00:08:15.760" style="s2">sometimes that method or that language</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.100" end="00:08:18.680" style="s2">game is useful but we should just be</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.760" end="00:08:20.930" style="s2">cognizant when we slid into one</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.680" end="00:08:22.070" style="s2">framework of language or the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.930" end="00:08:24.380" style="s2">that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.070" end="00:08:25.970" style="s2">yeah right right and this is kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.380" end="00:08:28.789" style="s2">of the distinctions that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.970" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">make when I am reframing the states for</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.789" end="00:08:32.270" style="s2">more and emergentist perspective like</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:35.419" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s not like I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.270" end="00:08:37.729" style="s2">we&#39;re accessing like the Bardo realm or</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.419" end="00:08:39.650" style="s2">some kind of thing that&#39;s out there some</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.729" end="00:08:42.289" style="s2">kind of dimension that it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.650" end="00:08:44.450" style="s2">accessing your own interior dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.289" end="00:08:46.250" style="s2">of like archetypes and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.450" end="00:08:48.830" style="s2">yeah those are like some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.250" end="00:08:51.230" style="s2">different metaphysical perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.830" end="00:08:53.390" style="s2">Bruce was describing around how we think</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.230" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">about States and that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.390" end="00:08:57.350" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is that these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:59.209" style="s2">states are like loose metaphorical ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.350" end="00:09:01.540" style="s2">of talking about what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.209" end="00:09:01.540" style="s2">dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:10.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a metaphor it&#39;s like talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.730" end="00:09:13.010" style="s2">the noosphere metaphor is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.220" end="00:09:14.310" style="s2">different experiences or areas of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.010" end="00:09:15.990" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.310" end="00:09:18.510" style="s2">the other hand I mean I&#39;m gonna throw</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.990" end="00:09:21.540" style="s2">the sticky wicket in there any theory of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.510" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">states as experiential needs to account</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.540" end="00:09:26.460" style="s2">for the fact that there are entrained</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">patterns so the dream state seems to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.460" end="00:09:30.870" style="s2">have a pattern in this state seems to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.710" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">have a pattern and we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.870" end="00:09:36.060" style="s2">account for that so I would propose</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:38.779" style="s2">something see how this lands that kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.060" end="00:09:41.370" style="s2">of to get away from the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.779" end="00:09:43.800" style="s2">aspect of it for a moment to say that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.370" end="00:09:46.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain set of possible states</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.800" end="00:09:48.900" style="s2">that people can have very large set of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.410" end="00:09:51.029" style="s2">possibilities and that set of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.900" end="00:09:54.029" style="s2">possibilities has different properties</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.029" end="00:09:57.089" style="s2">one of the properties has to do with how</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.029" end="00:09:59.370" style="s2">you consider the boundaries between self</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.089" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">and world and another property might be</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.370" end="00:10:03.570" style="s2">whether you have self reflective</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:05.010" style="s2">metacognitive access to your own state</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.570" end="00:10:07.740" style="s2">that there are all these different</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.010" end="00:10:10.279" style="s2">properties and some of them seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.740" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">more important for certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.279" end="00:10:14.700" style="s2">spiritual purposes or endeavors in other</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:17.010" style="s2">words you could take any set of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.700" end="00:10:19.470" style="s2">important properties and cash out these</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.010" end="00:10:21.330" style="s2">categories that are only referenced</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.470" end="00:10:23.430" style="s2">because you thought that property was</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.330" end="00:10:25.260" style="s2">important so when you look at the basser</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.430" end="00:10:28.260" style="s2">old estates and you come up with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.260" end="00:10:30.120" style="s2">classic eastern states that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.260" end="00:10:32.580" style="s2">you&#39;re focusing on certain properties of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.120" end="00:10:34.680" style="s2">states and that kind of collapses it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.580" end="00:10:36.690" style="s2">into four categories so when in fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.680" end="00:10:38.790" style="s2">those aren&#39;t ontological areal</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.690" end="00:10:41.370" style="s2">categories they point to what properties</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.790" end="00:10:44.790" style="s2">are important to you and be they point</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.370" end="00:10:47.520" style="s2">to the fact that our experience tends to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.790" end="00:10:49.710" style="s2">group around a certain set of properties</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.520" end="00:10:52.140" style="s2">about infinite sets so it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.710" end="00:10:54.330" style="s2">smooth distribution it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.140" end="00:10:56.010" style="s2">usually either awake or dreaming but</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.330" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a place in between and so when</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.010" end="00:11:00.540" style="s2">you put things into those categories you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:02.220" style="s2">miss what&#39;s in between the categories</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.540" end="00:11:04.740" style="s2">themselves are useful tools but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:07.080" style="s2">no ontological force States when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.740" end="00:11:09.000" style="s2">give an example of what you mean by in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.080" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">between yeah that liminal place of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.000" end="00:11:13.320" style="s2">waking up when you&#39;re in between waking</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:15.570" style="s2">and dreaming if we spent a lot more time</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.320" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">in that state it might show up as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.570" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">fifth state just because it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">prominent and highlighted in life well I</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:24.870" style="s2">would also say that for my definition</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:26.870" style="s2">when you&#39;re dreaming you don&#39;t usually</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.870" end="00:11:29.450" style="s2">have access to your body</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.870" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2">like body paralysis but in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.450" end="00:11:33.620" style="s2">you did also have body drop you have no</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:35.630" style="s2">access to your body but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.620" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">dreaming so there&#39;s many many different</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.630" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">combinations of what dreaming is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.230" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">dreaming your body is dropped and other</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.570" end="00:11:53.750" style="s2">things so there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:55.850" style="s2">combinations right so even dream state</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.750" end="00:11:57.890" style="s2">is kind of too broad of a category</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.850" end="00:12:00.650" style="s2">because a lot of times we&#39;re doing like</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.890" end="00:12:02.990" style="s2">imaginal type meditations or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.650" end="00:12:04.820" style="s2">and we could be closing our eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.990" end="00:12:06.830" style="s2">visualizing things but like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.820" end="00:12:09.350" style="s2">saying we&#39;re still basically awake and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.830" end="00:12:11.720" style="s2">we have access to our body and so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.350" end="00:12:13.490" style="s2">might be dreaming and the body drop is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.720" end="00:12:17.710" style="s2">not happening and your perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.490" end="00:12:17.710" style="s2">systems on so there&#39;s many many comedy</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.980" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a good distinction yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.779" end="00:12:25.490" style="s2">more of like a blanket term for a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">of different kinds of experiences then</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.490" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">like a very useful particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:35.300" style="s2">category or whatever yeah I mean people</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:37.430" style="s2">can do are you&#39;re like painting on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.300" end="00:12:40.450" style="s2">canvas a very dreamlike it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.430" end="00:12:43.580" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with something and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.450" end="00:12:45.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a dream it&#39;s yeah flow</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.580" end="00:12:48.380" style="s2">state can be like a different state than</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.800" end="00:12:54.860" style="s2">the waking state but it is technically</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.380" end="00:12:56.930" style="s2">in the waking state or whatever yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.860" end="00:12:59.089" style="s2">I think kind of what we&#39;ve done here is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.930" end="00:13:00.670" style="s2">talked about how we can see these states</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.089" end="00:13:03.050" style="s2">through the perspective of different</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.670" end="00:13:04.760" style="s2">metaphysical lenses that we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.050" end="00:13:07.190" style="s2">kind of trying to figure out a good way</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.760" end="00:13:09.410" style="s2">to talk about it and it seems like Tom</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.190" end="00:13:11.450" style="s2">pointed us in the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.410" end="00:13:13.459" style="s2">importance of these states and how we</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.450" end="00:13:15.890" style="s2">see them and how we value them in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.459" end="00:13:18.500" style="s2">relation to different projects given our</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.890" end="00:13:22.040" style="s2">metaphysical assumptions yeah there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.500" end="00:13:24.950" style="s2">no real ontological States out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.040" end="00:13:26.750" style="s2">each categorization scheme is a tool</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.950" end="00:13:28.279" style="s2">that we bring to bear and I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.750" end="00:13:30.140" style="s2">important there is don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.279" end="00:13:31.880" style="s2">vocabulary that&#39;s got 12 parts if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.140" end="00:13:33.800" style="s2">got one that has four parts that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.880" end="00:13:35.930" style="s2">usable and more understandable and more</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.800" end="00:13:37.690" style="s2">shareable so I think the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.930" end="00:13:40.130" style="s2">is when you use a particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.690" end="00:13:40.860" style="s2">classification scheme it&#39;s got four</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.130" end="00:13:43.710" style="s2">parts</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.860" end="00:13:46.380" style="s2">you kind of know on the side that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.710" end="00:13:48.660" style="s2">are ignoring everything that falls in</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.380" end="00:13:50.730" style="s2">between or outside of those four</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.660" end="00:13:52.350" style="s2">categories and if everybody can agree to</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.730" end="00:13:53.640" style="s2">that then you can move forward with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.350" end="00:13:55.560" style="s2">conversation but every once in a while</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.640" end="00:13:57.390" style="s2">you bump into something an example state</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.560" end="00:13:59.280" style="s2">that&#39;s in between and that&#39;s when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.390" end="00:14:01.530" style="s2">good to highlight the fact that you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.280" end="00:14:03.270" style="s2">using a particular vocabulary I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.530" end="00:14:09.930" style="s2">that&#39;s very useful that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.270" end="00:14:11.970" style="s2">set of distinctions it seems to me and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.930" end="00:14:14.010" style="s2">that is like why do these things matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.970" end="00:14:16.020" style="s2">like why does it matter that we talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.010" end="00:14:17.910" style="s2">about States I think people know why we</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.020" end="00:14:19.860" style="s2">it matters that we talked about stages</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.910" end="00:14:22.230" style="s2">of development the world gets complex we</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.860" end="00:14:25.470" style="s2">have to get more complex but what is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.230" end="00:14:28.050" style="s2">matter that we train ourself just be</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.470" end="00:14:30.120" style="s2">aware of States and train ourselves why</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.050" end="00:14:31.890" style="s2">does it matter that we dream and why</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.120" end="00:14:34.590" style="s2">does it matter that we know we dream and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.890" end="00:14:37.710" style="s2">why does it matter that we get into</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.590" end="00:14:40.080" style="s2">mindfulness states where we drop certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.710" end="00:14:43.320" style="s2">things and highlight other things and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.080" end="00:14:45.180" style="s2">why does it matter so maybe Michael and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.320" end="00:14:48.450" style="s2">layman can talk about this what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.180" end="00:14:50.790" style="s2">big deal why does it matter yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.450" end="00:14:53.010" style="s2">wanted to step in since Michael hen</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.790" end="00:14:54.570" style="s2">layman hadn&#39;t spoken yet and asked if</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.010" end="00:14:56.640" style="s2">there was anything that they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.570" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">add in relationship to the initial</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.640" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">sharing but then also yes I do want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:02.130" style="s2">move towards our first question which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">very much in line with exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.130" end="00:15:06.120" style="s2">Bonnie&#39;s asking for so before we move</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:07.800" style="s2">into that just briefly is there anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.120" end="00:15:09.540" style="s2">in relationship to what was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.800" end="00:15:11.250" style="s2">discussed Michael or blaming that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.540" end="00:15:15.090" style="s2">would like to add I think these are very</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.250" end="00:15:17.250" style="s2">19th century issues very modern issues</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.090" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">and they really go to the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.250" end="00:15:22.680" style="s2">of knowing to be and the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:24.930" style="s2">confidence being part of inherently</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.680" end="00:15:27.900" style="s2">meaningful universe that&#39;s a big topic</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.930" end="00:15:31.350" style="s2">but I think States really become a crux</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.900" end="00:15:33.420" style="s2">for human beings to explore where there</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.350" end="00:15:35.340" style="s2">are realms that have something to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.420" end="00:15:37.530" style="s2">with these expanded States or not so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.340" end="00:15:39.380" style="s2">have a lot more I could say on it but</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.530" end="00:15:42.360" style="s2">that would be my concern is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.380" end="00:15:44.790" style="s2">inheriting this disenchanted universe</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.360" end="00:15:46.710" style="s2">which has all kinds of implications for</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.790" end="00:15:49.260" style="s2">identity how we relate to one another</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.710" end="00:15:51.030" style="s2">where we access meaning where we seek</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.260" end="00:15:52.890" style="s2">the status of truth and how we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.030" end="00:15:54.230" style="s2">conditions of truth it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.890" end="00:15:56.390" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.230" end="00:15:57.860" style="s2">is often under underground it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.390" end="00:16:00.050" style="s2">unconscious or sort of a pre</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.860" end="00:16:03.140" style="s2">understanding that people carry various</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.050" end="00:16:05.510" style="s2">ways I think States accessing the state</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.140" end="00:16:07.130" style="s2">certain kinds of states and what degree</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.510" end="00:16:08.960" style="s2">their interest objective into your</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.130" end="00:16:11.180" style="s2">objective what are the causalities</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.960" end="00:16:13.700" style="s2">involved with them what degree they go</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.180" end="00:16:15.560" style="s2">beyond into something like a realm we</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.700" end="00:16:17.960" style="s2">move from epistemology to something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.560" end="00:16:20.540" style="s2">ontology I think that&#39;s the crux of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.960" end="00:16:22.310" style="s2">and why they&#39;re really important to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.540" end="00:16:24.290" style="s2">really explore I like the distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.310" end="00:16:25.880" style="s2">that were being made before and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.290" end="00:16:28.400" style="s2">very attentive to something like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.880" end="00:16:30.740" style="s2">difference between immersion and just</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.400" end="00:16:32.600" style="s2">focusing on a facet of reality that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.740" end="00:16:35.390" style="s2">comes up there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.600" end="00:16:37.180" style="s2">being in a state seemingly where it</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.390" end="00:16:40.400" style="s2">comes around you like I&#39;m in dreams</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.180" end="00:16:42.500" style="s2">versus I&#39;m picking out that element of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.400" end="00:16:44.360" style="s2">my blended experience that I might</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.500" end="00:16:46.820" style="s2">associate with particular dreamlike</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.360" end="00:16:51.350" style="s2">qualities for me it seems like all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.820" end="00:16:53.830" style="s2">the four sets of types of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.350" end="00:16:56.090" style="s2">things you need to have for reality are</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.830" end="00:16:58.700" style="s2">omnipresent all the time and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.090" end="00:17:00.950" style="s2">it feels like you go inside them in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.700" end="00:17:03.230" style="s2">various different ways and at various</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.950" end="00:17:05.030" style="s2">different combinations and when we say</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.230" end="00:17:07.490" style="s2">just maybe for people watching and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.030" end="00:17:10.220" style="s2">listening if we say it&#39;s not like there</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.490" end="00:17:12.320" style="s2">really are these other realms that also</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.220" end="00:17:14.330" style="s2">means the gross realms not like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.320" end="00:17:16.520" style="s2">saying there is just the gross realm and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.330" end="00:17:19.550" style="s2">these other ones are metaphorical this</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.520" end="00:17:22.070" style="s2">physical one is of that same nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.550" end="00:17:24.140" style="s2">a partial interpretation of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.070" end="00:17:26.660" style="s2">on that is a much more complex affair</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.140" end="00:17:29.030" style="s2">and so why is that meaningful why am i</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.660" end="00:17:30.830" style="s2">interested in that well the higher our</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.030" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">answer is I just love it and I love the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.830" end="00:17:34.730" style="s2">people that are involved in it but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:37.850" style="s2">lower order answers are something like I</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.730" end="00:17:40.190" style="s2">feel that any kind of well-being depends</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.850" end="00:17:42.350" style="s2">on the fidelity of how well we</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.190" end="00:17:44.900" style="s2">personally socially and even</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.350" end="00:17:46.850" style="s2">technologically map to reality and if</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.900" end="00:17:49.160" style="s2">reality consists of these sets of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.850" end="00:17:51.800" style="s2">experiences these other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.160" end="00:17:53.960" style="s2">experiences included in the map or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.800" end="00:17:56.120" style="s2">map will consistently fail to provide</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.960" end="00:17:58.280" style="s2">richness of experience I think Whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.120" end="00:18:00.800" style="s2">said something like if reality is only</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.280" end="00:18:03.260" style="s2">that which we put together based on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.800" end="00:18:04.970" style="s2">waking experiences of sober Europeans</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.260" end="00:18:07.310" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be very narrow model that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.970" end="00:18:07.879" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason not to sample every</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.310" end="00:18:10.339" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.879" end="00:18:12.169" style="s2">of state in order to form a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.339" end="00:18:13.579" style="s2">image of what reality consists of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.169" end="00:18:16.099" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.579" end="00:18:18.079" style="s2">justification for sampling only one type</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.099" end="00:18:20.149" style="s2">of state experience in order to form a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.079" end="00:18:22.609" style="s2">reality model and we seem to have done</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.149" end="00:18:24.379" style="s2">that at least publicly over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.609" end="00:18:26.539" style="s2">hundred years even though in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.379" end="00:18:28.399" style="s2">actual lives they never stopped having</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.539" end="00:18:31.089" style="s2">an enchanted experience personally I</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.399" end="00:18:34.399" style="s2">feel like it&#39;s a significant driver of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.089" end="00:18:37.249" style="s2">beingness and overall development even</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.399" end="00:18:40.119" style="s2">development through stages to produce</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.249" end="00:18:43.309" style="s2">and reproduce balanced and harmonized</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.119" end="00:18:45.619" style="s2">experiences between different subjective</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.309" end="00:18:47.959" style="s2">subsets of your possibilities those</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.619" end="00:18:49.849" style="s2">subsets might be quadrants they might be</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.959" end="00:18:51.619" style="s2">States they might be different lines of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.849" end="00:18:53.569" style="s2">intelligence or however when we language</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.619" end="00:18:56.619" style="s2">those things but I think that the states</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.569" end="00:18:58.609" style="s2">are a very common very accessible</p>

<p begin="00:19:30.829" end="00:19:34.849" style="s2">for anyone responding let&#39;s try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.629" end="00:19:37.309" style="s2">it within about three minutes and just</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.759" end="00:19:49.399" style="s2">more general experiential field the</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.399" end="00:19:57.109" style="s2">people to create discernment around are</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.149" end="00:19:58.989" style="s2">things like curiosity and love and state</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.109" end="00:20:02.089" style="s2">of like tension or contraction</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.989" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">dissociation between yourself between</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.979" end="00:20:14.629" style="s2">guess that one&#39;s more like dream dream</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.139" end="00:20:17.869" style="s2">states where judgment and certain kinds</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.629" end="00:20:19.129" style="s2">of processing fall away so for me when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.869" end="00:20:21.620" style="s2">think of like what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.129" end="00:20:24.380" style="s2">conversations about States are important</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.620" end="00:20:25.700" style="s2">for my health well-being and the health</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.380" end="00:20:28.370" style="s2">about being of the world there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.700" end="00:20:30.110" style="s2">things like that how do we identify when</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.370" end="00:20:31.580" style="s2">this is happening here that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.110" end="00:20:34.309" style="s2">and how do we support the kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:20:34.309" end="00:20:39.559" style="s2">and I&#39;ll add as a teaser to see what</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.470" end="00:20:41.180" style="s2">other people think is that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.559" end="00:20:43.130" style="s2">states that we&#39;re talking about in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.180" end="00:20:46.970" style="s2">ones that I think are important are</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.130" end="00:20:49.100" style="s2">about letting go of certain aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.970" end="00:20:51.080" style="s2">waking it almost seems to me that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.100" end="00:20:52.730" style="s2">about turning off certain systems so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.080" end="00:20:56.090" style="s2">that we can live more fully within</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.730" end="00:20:58.790" style="s2">others more foundational parts of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.940" end="00:21:12.530" style="s2">states really matter because getting it</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.490" end="00:21:14.300" style="s2">right matters understanding what&#39;s going</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.300" end="00:21:18.980" style="s2">understand what&#39;s up with states then we</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.980" end="00:21:24.890" style="s2">in the ways that I see a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.590" end="00:21:26.660" style="s2">getting it wrong almost in every way has</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.890" end="00:21:29.330" style="s2">to do it an interpretation or</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.660" end="00:21:31.370" style="s2">translation of their experience so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.330" end="00:21:33.140" style="s2">think there are a lot of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.370" end="00:21:35.150" style="s2">a lot of good intentions and they want</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.140" end="00:21:37.100" style="s2">to do good in the world they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.150" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">a good person they want to live for a</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.770" end="00:21:50.630" style="s2">what does it mean to dream all these</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.020" end="00:21:52.520" style="s2">kind of questions this stuff is super</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.630" end="00:21:54.260" style="s2">important like a lot of philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.520" end="00:21:56.809" style="s2">these ideas they seem really</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.260" end="00:21:58.790" style="s2">pie-in-the-sky to people like why does</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.809" end="00:22:01.070" style="s2">it better you know like we disagree</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.790" end="00:22:02.360" style="s2">about these things like who cares can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.070" end="00:22:04.040" style="s2">we all just get along you know and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.360" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">that&#39;s there&#39;s something right about</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.040" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">that but at the same time it really does</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:08.870" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:11.210" style="s2">it not only matters to us as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.870" end="00:22:12.980" style="s2">but if we&#39;re integralists talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.210" end="00:22:15.020" style="s2">how we&#39;re going to birth a new integral</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.980" end="00:22:16.910" style="s2">age and create new systems to where</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.020" end="00:22:18.679" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do it better that assumes</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.910" end="00:22:20.990" style="s2">that we think that we know well enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.679" end="00:22:22.760" style="s2">to be able to create something healthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.990" end="00:22:24.770" style="s2">for other people and that means getting</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.760" end="00:22:27.350" style="s2">it right so I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.770" end="00:22:29.330" style="s2">important not just for our own personal</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.350" end="00:22:31.130" style="s2">daily lives and feeling like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.330" end="00:22:33.590" style="s2">aligned with reality and that were</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.130" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">living the moral and ethical life but it</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.590" end="00:22:37.950" style="s2">matters if we&#39;re thinking about try</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:40.350" style="s2">to scale these ideas and pass them on to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.950" end="00:22:43.170" style="s2">other people there&#39;s a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:45.480" style="s2">social responsibility as well as</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.170" end="00:22:47.850" style="s2">personal responsibility when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.480" end="00:22:49.650" style="s2">these things I think so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.850" end="00:22:53.900" style="s2">looking forward to hearing what Bonita</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.650" end="00:22:53.900" style="s2">thinks why she thinks it&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.220" end="00:23:00.510" style="s2">what are you gonna be quiet about it so</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.380" end="00:23:03.930" style="s2">I think it matters because states are</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.510" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">powerful experiences unusual States even</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.930" end="00:23:09.720" style="s2">ordinary kind of state experiences have</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.260" end="00:23:14.160" style="s2">a powerful signature on a human</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.720" end="00:23:17.310" style="s2">experience and they&#39;re part of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.160" end="00:23:20.280" style="s2">technologies and I just seen state</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.310" end="00:23:22.860" style="s2">experience being used and abused first</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.280" end="00:23:25.590" style="s2">you know spiritual technologies and for</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.860" end="00:23:27.570" style="s2">abusive and hierarchical and all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.590" end="00:23:29.880" style="s2">of right for people to make money this</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.570" end="00:23:32.100" style="s2">has been going on for millennia right</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.880" end="00:23:35.160" style="s2">it&#39;s become there&#39;s been a marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.100" end="00:23:37.110" style="s2">for state technologies for millennia so</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.160" end="00:23:39.150" style="s2">I think that&#39;s one that&#39;s a negative</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.110" end="00:23:40.860" style="s2">aspect of it but I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.150" end="00:23:43.290" style="s2">because they&#39;re powerful and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.860" end="00:23:46.650" style="s2">to create State experiences and people</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.290" end="00:23:49.530" style="s2">is a very very powerful transmission and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.650" end="00:23:51.810" style="s2">I think we need to understand them for</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.530" end="00:23:54.780" style="s2">the human potential that they are I</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.810" end="00:23:57.480" style="s2">understand that you know they&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.780" end="00:24:01.650" style="s2">the human evolutionary potential of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.480" end="00:24:04.230" style="s2">core self I think and treat them as that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.650" end="00:24:06.450" style="s2">treat them as any other human potential</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.230" end="00:24:09.480" style="s2">and not subject to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.450" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">supposedly closer to God you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.480" end="00:24:13.350" style="s2">always teach my students like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.910" style="s2">if everybody was disembodied in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.350" end="00:24:16.380" style="s2">dream state and then there was a few</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.910" end="00:24:18.480" style="s2">rare people that came back and said no</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.380" end="00:24:20.490" style="s2">like there&#39;s a real world you can taste</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.480" end="00:24:22.050" style="s2">things and you have a body you know and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.490" end="00:24:24.270" style="s2">there&#39;s an object&#39;s these would be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.050" end="00:24:27.390" style="s2">gurus of that environment so I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.270" end="00:24:29.160" style="s2">States are very powerful but even</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.390" end="00:24:31.710" style="s2">ordinary states are very powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.160" end="00:24:34.050" style="s2">sacred we end up sometimes thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.710" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s just ordinary but how can we make</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.050" end="00:24:37.740" style="s2">meaning together like how could I be on</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:39.480" style="s2">this screen with you across like</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.740" end="00:24:42.900" style="s2">transmission this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.480" end="00:24:44.760" style="s2">tremendously tremendously fantastic even</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.900" end="00:24:47.730" style="s2">an ordinary experience so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.760" end="00:24:48.770" style="s2">caveat but I think also once we get over</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.730" end="00:24:50.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.770" end="00:24:53.750" style="s2">and stop using them as some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.920" end="00:24:55.340" style="s2">transactional spiritual technology I</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.750" end="00:24:58.190" style="s2">think there&#39;s something about how many</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.340" end="00:25:00.530" style="s2">degrees of freedom that states allow you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.190" end="00:25:03.080" style="s2">know the more states you can access just</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.530" end="00:25:05.390" style="s2">like the more perspectives I always say</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.080" end="00:25:07.730" style="s2">that states are the view from which the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.390" end="00:25:11.030" style="s2">perspecsys arise you become less</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.730" end="00:25:13.460" style="s2">habituated to conditioned ways of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.030" end="00:25:16.220" style="s2">looking at the world more reality is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.460" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">allowed in that becomes reality becomes</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.220" end="00:25:20.780" style="s2">more and more sacred more and more</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:23.810" style="s2">mysterious more luminous there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.780" end="00:25:26.930" style="s2">states that can liberate ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.810" end="00:25:29.180" style="s2">perception so in certain ordinary states</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.930" end="00:25:31.670" style="s2">perception is actually quite limited and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.180" end="00:25:34.040" style="s2">even though perception is seen as part</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.670" end="00:25:36.050" style="s2">of the waking state like in a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.040" end="00:25:38.270" style="s2">state experience you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.050" end="00:25:41.510" style="s2">actually the capacity is much greater</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.270" end="00:25:43.940" style="s2">than the limited capacity so I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.510" end="00:25:46.580" style="s2">that there&#39;s more degrees of freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.940" end="00:25:49.010" style="s2">much more fullness in our ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.580" end="00:25:52.940" style="s2">capacity when we enter different states</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.010" end="00:25:55.820" style="s2">and a much larger view of who we are and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.940" end="00:25:58.340" style="s2">our role in the cosmology and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.820" end="00:26:02.090" style="s2">that is also liberating so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.340" end="00:26:03.770" style="s2">of my answer ha thanks for asking yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.090" end="00:26:05.690" style="s2">really like that answer and I really</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.770" end="00:26:08.390" style="s2">like what you said about appreciating</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.690" end="00:26:10.850" style="s2">ordinary States and not just the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.390" end="00:26:13.040" style="s2">heightened States because yeah life is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.850" end="00:26:15.890" style="s2">blessing as it is so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.040" end="00:26:18.410" style="s2">great the paradox is in most cases you</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.890" end="00:26:22.820" style="s2">need an altered state to appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.410" end="00:26:25.900" style="s2">ordinary state that&#39;s that&#39;s the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.820" end="00:26:28.220" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point even though I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.900" end="00:26:30.650" style="s2">moderator here I&#39;m tempted to jump in</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.220" end="00:26:32.840" style="s2">and say something a little bit in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.650" end="00:26:34.580" style="s2">transpersonal psychology classes you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.840" end="00:26:36.980" style="s2">know I think modern Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.580" end="00:26:39.680" style="s2">tends to be somewhat state impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.980" end="00:26:41.810" style="s2">I like to joke to students that in our</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.680" end="00:26:43.580" style="s2">culture we&#39;ve mastered four states which</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.810" end="00:26:45.890" style="s2">are waking dreaming drunk and high and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.580" end="00:26:47.930" style="s2">most people don&#39;t venture very far out</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.890" end="00:26:49.790" style="s2">of that but if you immerse yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.930" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">other cultures you can see that there</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.790" end="00:26:51.920" style="s2">are people and other cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:54.350" style="s2">actually have great facility in</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.920" end="00:26:56.210" style="s2">navigating a whole range of states and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.350" end="00:26:57.530" style="s2">effecting different kinds of things from</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.060" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">those states or not I think trans press</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.220" end="00:27:23.330" style="s2">lists have done us the benefits starting</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:24.890" style="s2">with young possibly and others going</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.330" end="00:27:27.560" style="s2">forward showing us just the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.890" end="00:27:30.230" style="s2">transformative potential of state access</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.560" end="00:27:32.750" style="s2">one to shift perspectives to dis embed</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.230" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">us from our conditioned perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.750" end="00:27:38.420" style="s2">open up new horizons of possibility to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:40.960" style="s2">enlarge the scope of the self and its</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.420" end="00:27:43.640" style="s2">activities to actually allow for</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.960" end="00:27:46.250" style="s2">psycho-emotional processing that can</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.640" end="00:27:48.140" style="s2">move through the system in a more rapid</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.250" end="00:27:50.510" style="s2">and coherent way than just verbal</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.140" end="00:27:52.370" style="s2">processing of the analysis on the couch</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.510" end="00:27:54.170" style="s2">so there&#39;s just a whole range of things</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.370" end="00:27:56.300" style="s2">there that I think you know we need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.170" end="00:27:58.430" style="s2">pay attention to the gifts of states for</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.300" end="00:28:00.830" style="s2">helping us arrive at deeper States</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.430" end="00:28:03.530" style="s2">personal integration bringing more of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.830" end="00:28:06.020" style="s2">our capacities onboard and actually just</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.530" end="00:28:08.660" style="s2">app respectable gift of dis embedding us</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.020" end="00:28:11.270" style="s2">from presupposed world spaces to open up</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.660" end="00:28:13.190" style="s2">horizons of possibility for us well</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.270" end="00:28:15.530" style="s2">Bruce I really appreciated that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.190" end="00:28:18.560" style="s2">echoing in these cultures that are not</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.530" end="00:28:20.750" style="s2">so allergic to some of these other more</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.560" end="00:28:23.060" style="s2">expansive states that are available it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.750" end="00:28:25.460" style="s2">not just we&#39;re tending to frame it as</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.060" end="00:28:27.110" style="s2">personal subjective and so on even if</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.460" end="00:28:29.630" style="s2">you bracket the metaphysics and any</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.110" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">strong sense the ability for groups to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.630" end="00:28:34.760" style="s2">access them States have all quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:37.400" style="s2">implications there are causalities that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.760" end="00:28:40.190" style="s2">occur there are abilities to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.400" end="00:28:42.190" style="s2">subjectivity such subjectivity zin these</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:45.770" style="s2">higher States energies touch one another</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.190" end="00:28:48.740" style="s2">healings occur so I wonder even the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.770" end="00:28:51.260" style="s2">we in the West frame this interact in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.740" end="00:28:54.230" style="s2">course called transpersonal psychology</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.260" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">you have a strong bias to framing States</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.230" end="00:28:58.940" style="s2">in terms of the individual in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:01.460" style="s2">the personal in terms of experience and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.940" end="00:29:03.140" style="s2">I might learn something from traditional</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.460" end="00:29:05.570" style="s2">cultures in that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.140" end="00:29:07.310" style="s2">something in these expanded States that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.570" end="00:29:09.860" style="s2">are more interest objective inter</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.310" end="00:29:12.470" style="s2">objective and have causal implications</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.860" end="00:29:14.660" style="s2">which then begins to point to something</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.470" end="00:29:15.800" style="s2">beyond ourselves that these states</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.660" end="00:29:19.450" style="s2">involved Wow</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.800" end="00:29:24.190" style="s2">my curiosity yeah so I&#39;m gonna agree</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.450" end="00:29:28.850" style="s2">that there&#39;s a causal implication state</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.190" end="00:29:32.200" style="s2">experiences are causally have causal</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.850" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">implications let&#39;s say that no this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.200" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">tricky</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.750" end="00:29:43.400" style="s2">but yeah that&#39;s affirm I would say just</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:47.410" style="s2">for clarification here what do we mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.400" end="00:29:50.180" style="s2">by causal in this context an ability to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.410" end="00:29:52.700" style="s2">affect our experience or collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.180" end="00:29:53.900" style="s2">experience or shared experience in some</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.700" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">way so you mean like cause-and-effect</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.900" end="00:30:00.200" style="s2">kind of a thing yeah that causative</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:02.900" style="s2">mechanisms what if I can go into a deep</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.200" end="00:30:05.390" style="s2">state with another person and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.900" end="00:30:07.430" style="s2">effect a transformation in that person</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.390" end="00:30:09.860" style="s2">will generate knowledge that might not</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.430" end="00:30:11.960" style="s2">otherwise be available traditionally and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.860" end="00:30:16.550" style="s2">that knowledge actually ends up having</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.960" end="00:30:18.620" style="s2">some kind of fix in ways we that begins</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.550" end="00:30:21.890" style="s2">to suggest even if it&#39;s a probability</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.620" end="00:30:24.380" style="s2">rather than kind of a mechanical ball</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.890" end="00:30:26.510" style="s2">that we&#39;re dealing with something that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.380" end="00:30:29.000" style="s2">is beyond this notion of subjective and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.510" end="00:30:32.150" style="s2">something personal and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.000" end="00:30:35.240" style="s2">these have been framed in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.150" end="00:30:37.370" style="s2">the 19th century people what really</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.240" end="00:30:39.770" style="s2">happened I don&#39;t think you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.370" end="00:30:42.050" style="s2">quick leap into some strong ontological</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.770" end="00:30:44.180" style="s2">realm claim I think it&#39;s a careful</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.050" end="00:30:46.160" style="s2">matter of going from the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.180" end="00:30:48.110" style="s2">evidence that are both subjective and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.160" end="00:30:49.820" style="s2">objective and repeatable but then</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.110" end="00:30:51.890" style="s2">there&#39;s something you know philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.820" end="00:30:53.390" style="s2">calls transcendental arguments about</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.890" end="00:30:55.550" style="s2">what does the world need to look like</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.390" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">for this to be occurring where do the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.550" end="00:31:00.440" style="s2">causal mechanisms have to lie and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">consciousness studies actually do this</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.440" end="00:31:04.370" style="s2">kind of fizzle software the work in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:06.560" style="s2">very careful way and I would share a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.370" end="00:31:09.170" style="s2">kind of commitment along those lines of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.560" end="00:31:12.620" style="s2">exploring what degree we can move from</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.170" end="00:31:16.100" style="s2">these subjective experiences States to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.620" end="00:31:18.170" style="s2">something about that would be my</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.100" end="00:31:20.990" style="s2">curiosity and I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.170" end="00:31:21.650" style="s2">inherent in the opening of SES that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.990" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">another story</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.650" end="00:31:29.300" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s invocation of shelling and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:31.010" style="s2">would say I&#39;m gonna bring it down to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.300" end="00:31:32.780" style="s2">but it should resonate with what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.010" end="00:31:35.210" style="s2">said so for example if someone is</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.780" end="00:31:37.430" style="s2">paranoid schizophrenic that&#39;s a steak we</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.210" end="00:31:39.920" style="s2">call that a state it has actual causal</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.430" end="00:31:42.290" style="s2">implications because he thinks that this</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.920" end="00:31:43.550" style="s2">paranoia is actually rising in the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.290" end="00:31:46.580" style="s2">and then he takes out a gun and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.550" end="00:31:49.400" style="s2">shoots them so it&#39;s causally effective</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.580" end="00:31:53.240" style="s2">that state is causally affective it</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.400" end="00:31:57.350" style="s2">actually apps in the world and so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.240" end="00:31:59.750" style="s2">think the state experiencers or being in</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.350" end="00:32:02.870" style="s2">certain states of awareness or these</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.750" end="00:32:05.240" style="s2">other states change behavior at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.870" end="00:32:07.670" style="s2">level that is just ordinary causation so</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.240" end="00:32:09.530" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the lowest bar of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.670" end="00:32:12.620" style="s2">thinking about causation but I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.530" end="00:32:15.230" style="s2">there&#39;s other levels of how that happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.620" end="00:32:17.270" style="s2">the whole area of causation is really</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.230" end="00:32:19.250" style="s2">fascinating I&#39;m learning about numinous</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.270" end="00:32:22.040" style="s2">causation is everywhere no we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.250" end="00:32:24.110" style="s2">same time and when you enter that way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.040" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">living it feels like a different state</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.110" end="00:32:29.000" style="s2">like agency is everywhere it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:32.750" style="s2">present in all directions and so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.000" end="00:32:34.040" style="s2">start not only Oh making big actions in</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.750" end="00:32:36.710" style="s2">the world like shooting someone because</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.040" end="00:32:39.410" style="s2">you&#39;re paranoid but you begin to notice</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.710" end="00:32:42.170" style="s2">how things work and then you make small</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.410" end="00:32:44.330" style="s2">movements in concert with the way things</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.170" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">work so that&#39;s what I would call true</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.330" end="00:32:49.490" style="s2">causal that things just work a certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:51.380" style="s2">way and you just make small movements in</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.490" end="00:32:53.690" style="s2">concert with the way they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.380" end="00:32:56.390" style="s2">working already and that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.690" end="00:32:58.250" style="s2">different relationship to causality but</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.390" end="00:33:00.680" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of hinting at because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.250" end="00:33:02.570" style="s2">like a big thing it&#39;s beyond the scope</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.680" end="00:33:05.630" style="s2">of what we&#39;re talking about but I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.570" end="00:33:07.550" style="s2">say that certain state experiences not</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.630" end="00:33:09.380" style="s2">any one particular state experience but</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.550" end="00:33:11.900" style="s2">but if you go through a lot of state</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.380" end="00:33:14.300" style="s2">experiences they deconstruct a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.900" end="00:33:18.460" style="s2">what you typically think is cause and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.300" end="00:33:22.490" style="s2">effect and they open the possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.460" end="00:33:24.500" style="s2">relating to causality and in different</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.490" end="00:33:26.780" style="s2">ways can you give an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.500" end="00:33:28.910" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that be like a translation of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.780" end="00:33:31.730" style="s2">the experience that&#39;s a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.910" end="00:33:35.240" style="s2">that there are ordinary experiences when</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.730" end="00:33:37.790" style="s2">we say if they&#39;re not right in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.240" end="00:33:40.070" style="s2">of language this kind of causality seems</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.790" end="00:33:42.050" style="s2">to be breaking down because if I go to</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.070" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">school and get good grades and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.050" end="00:33:46.970" style="s2">good job this is all starting to break</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:50.180" style="s2">down the whole ability to make it then</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.970" end="00:33:52.340" style="s2">statements is becoming unreliable so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.180" end="00:33:54.860" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.340" end="00:33:59.860" style="s2">second order of causality where you say</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.860" end="00:34:07.610" style="s2">well it&#39;s all emergent and uncertain and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.860" end="00:34:09.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot less causal links and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.610" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">third is what if there&#39;s no if and no</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.470" end="00:34:15.800" style="s2">then how does that work how does it work</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:18.050" style="s2">if there&#39;s no if how are we coming to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.800" end="00:34:19.970" style="s2">the conclusion that there is no if and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.050" end="00:34:24.380" style="s2">no then like for example the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.970" end="00:34:31.610" style="s2">you know wouldn&#39;t that be a translation</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.380" end="00:34:34.310" style="s2">of a state experience well just heavy</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.610" end="00:34:35.690" style="s2">aryans of it doesn&#39;t necessarily make it</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.310" end="00:34:37.970" style="s2">true right because I can have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.690" end="00:34:39.860" style="s2">experience of Jesus in my heart but that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.970" end="00:34:42.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really mean that it&#39;s Gena art</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.860" end="00:34:45.320" style="s2">implicates my whole being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.080" end="00:34:48.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s causally just like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.320" end="00:34:49.970" style="s2">paranoid schizophrenic implicates their</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.020" end="00:34:52.940" style="s2">being in the world and that&#39;s causally</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.970" end="00:34:56.090" style="s2">affected I think a lot of the states</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.940" end="00:34:59.390" style="s2">that were interested in are examples of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.090" end="00:35:02.150" style="s2">things dropping away and so we</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.390" end="00:35:04.490" style="s2">experience a more expansive set of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.150" end="00:35:08.660" style="s2">possibilities and perceptions and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.490" end="00:35:10.850" style="s2">intuitions and then I think what can</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.660" end="00:35:12.770" style="s2">happen with people is then like</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.850" end="00:35:16.340" style="s2">something fresh and new comes up from</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.770" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">that space and they reassign so it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.340" end="00:35:21.530" style="s2">thing to drop the planning cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:24.020" style="s2">mind and drop certain kinds of beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.530" end="00:35:26.810" style="s2">and drop into even a space where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.020" end="00:35:31.070" style="s2">no time or space and though if and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.810" end="00:35:32.660" style="s2">and it&#39;s another to have something come</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.070" end="00:35:35.450" style="s2">up within that space and then hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.660" end="00:35:38.180" style="s2">it like ah now I have the answer so for</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.450" end="00:35:40.010" style="s2">me that&#39;s a important distinction like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.180" end="00:35:42.470" style="s2">there&#39;s something about dropping into</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.010" end="00:35:47.360" style="s2">these spaces including the into</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.470" end="00:35:50.390" style="s2">subjective space and allowing fresh new</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.360" end="00:35:52.910" style="s2">things to arise then there&#39;s a trick I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.390" end="00:35:55.310" style="s2">think which is a more kind of evolved or</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.910" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">post-postmodern skill which is not to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.310" end="00:35:59.030" style="s2">let</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:36:00.890" style="s2">reapply or turn into six categories or</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.030" end="00:36:02.750" style="s2">beliefs from there but to stay in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.890" end="00:36:04.340" style="s2">flow of it I guess it&#39;s related that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.750" end="00:36:07.310" style="s2">were saying Bonnie if you&#39;re just you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.340" end="00:36:09.770" style="s2">just allowing your knowledge to sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.310" end="00:36:11.570" style="s2">and respond and do this incremental</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.770" end="00:36:13.430" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of letting the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.570" end="00:36:16.010" style="s2">do the thinking instead of the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.430" end="00:36:18.530" style="s2">rational mind in a sense my concern</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.010" end="00:36:21.380" style="s2">about this is that what often happens</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.530" end="00:36:23.660" style="s2">with spiritual experience is that were</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.380" end="00:36:26.810" style="s2">taught some spiritual teachings and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.660" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">we&#39;re initiated into an experience and</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.810" end="00:36:30.859" style="s2">then we understand that experience in</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:32.990" style="s2">the light of the spiritual teachings</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.859" end="00:36:34.849" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been taught and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.990" end="00:36:37.070" style="s2">is that we&#39;re taught that it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.849" end="00:36:40.070" style="s2">kind of pure experience or this pure</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.070" end="00:36:41.869" style="s2">knowing when in fact even that is part</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.070" end="00:36:44.840" style="s2">of the circular reasoning of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.869" end="00:36:46.609" style="s2">conditioned experience so we come out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.840" end="00:36:48.290" style="s2">an experience and we describe our</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.609" end="00:36:50.390" style="s2">experience but we describe our</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.290" end="00:36:52.280" style="s2">experience and the light of what we</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.390" end="00:36:54.349" style="s2">think about it already so like this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.280" end="00:36:56.090" style="s2">like where I think it&#39;s interesting like</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.349" end="00:36:59.030" style="s2">the will becomes matrix like for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.090" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">Tom you were talking about in your talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.030" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">about how practicing States these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:07.160" style="s2">of habits that you can you can work on</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:08.780" style="s2">in practice eventually they can become</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.160" end="00:37:10.790" style="s2">like structures of consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.780" end="00:37:12.740" style="s2">you can build up but I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.790" end="00:37:15.140" style="s2">this because that&#39;s like saying that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.740" end="00:37:17.480" style="s2">states become stages but when the Wilbur</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.140" end="00:37:19.550" style="s2">combs matrix it almost seems like Wilbur</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.480" end="00:37:21.050" style="s2">is kind of contradicting himself because</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.550" end="00:37:22.849" style="s2">they&#39;re he&#39;s saying that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.050" end="00:37:24.859" style="s2">translating and we&#39;re understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.849" end="00:37:26.810" style="s2">whatever state that we have from</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.859" end="00:37:28.670" style="s2">whatever stage that we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.810" end="00:37:30.470" style="s2">like we only have whatever tools that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.670" end="00:37:33.230" style="s2">we&#39;re working with at the moment to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.470" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">able to translate our experience and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.230" end="00:37:37.670" style="s2">I feel like there&#39;s either some</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:39.740" style="s2">confusion or some kind of contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.670" end="00:37:41.240" style="s2">even within what Wilbur is saying around</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.740" end="00:37:43.369" style="s2">some of this stuff what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.240" end="00:37:45.260" style="s2">about this laymen I know you brought up</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.369" end="00:37:46.490" style="s2">the Wilbur combs matrix and your talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.260" end="00:37:49.220" style="s2">you were the only one who really</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.490" end="00:37:52.339" style="s2">mentioned for me that was a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.220" end="00:37:54.230" style="s2">important move from Wilbur to even</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.339" end="00:37:56.180" style="s2">partially because like you say he does</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.230" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">seem to vacillate on this subject but to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.180" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">move away from the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:02.750" style="s2">hierarchical notion of the states in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:05.900" style="s2">which some of them are more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.750" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">than others and that just doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.900" end="00:38:09.860" style="s2">to be the result of my experiencing or</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:11.960" style="s2">my thinking on the subject</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.860" end="00:38:14.180" style="s2">I really like the Wilbur combs lattice</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.960" end="00:38:16.700" style="s2">in the sense of putting them all on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.180" end="00:38:18.650" style="s2">same playing field and then bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.700" end="00:38:20.990" style="s2">this element of interpretation like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.650" end="00:38:23.060" style="s2">say there&#39;s variations in interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.990" end="00:38:25.370" style="s2">like the example you gave of having</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.060" end="00:38:27.670" style="s2">Jesus in your heart that&#39;s heavily laden</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.370" end="00:38:31.310" style="s2">with an interpretation but the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.670" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">not seeing a standard if-then logical</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.310" end="00:38:35.570" style="s2">sequence for me is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:38.180" style="s2">different like trying to define the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.570" end="00:38:40.340" style="s2">logic of a particular set of states like</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.180" end="00:38:42.200" style="s2">I might say that what I mean by the four</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.340" end="00:38:44.960" style="s2">states is something like four different</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.200" end="00:38:47.630" style="s2">kinds of logics of worlds where the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.960" end="00:38:50.570" style="s2">gross realm is the set of sequential</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.630" end="00:38:52.250" style="s2">logics right the einstein&#39;s proposition</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.570" end="00:38:54.380" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t really any simultaneity</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.250" end="00:38:56.750" style="s2">that characterizes physical energy</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.380" end="00:38:58.820" style="s2">transitions so there&#39;s an if/then</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.750" end="00:38:59.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a sequential logic to the entire</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.820" end="00:39:01.790" style="s2">gross realm you might say that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.960" end="00:39:04.550" style="s2">characterizes the gross realm so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.790" end="00:39:06.890" style="s2">not like a claim about the truth of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.550" end="00:39:08.840" style="s2">it&#39;s more of an experiential description</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.890" end="00:39:10.280" style="s2">as what you&#39;re saying yeah so some</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.840" end="00:39:12.770" style="s2">things people are saying are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.280" end="00:39:14.690" style="s2">closer to the experiential architectural</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.770" end="00:39:17.090" style="s2">description side and others ones will be</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.690" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">closer to something that&#39;s embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.090" end="00:39:22.190" style="s2">their personal and cultural interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:24.140" style="s2">reference which is either very quick or</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.190" end="00:39:25.610" style="s2">already embedded in their perception of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.140" end="00:39:27.710" style="s2">the experiences they have in other</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.610" end="00:39:29.870" style="s2">states I think that&#39;s a good distinction</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.710" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s hard because I think a</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.870" end="00:39:34.190" style="s2">lot of times people are so embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.260" style="s2">their worldview they take it for granted</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.190" end="00:39:37.940" style="s2">and they have this kind of like naive</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.260" end="00:39:40.520" style="s2">realism like I think that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.940" end="00:39:43.550" style="s2">experience they had is some kind of pure</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.520" end="00:39:45.500" style="s2">experience uncolored by all of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.550" end="00:39:47.210" style="s2">cultural conditioning that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.500" end="00:39:49.790" style="s2">received and I don&#39;t really think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.210" end="00:39:52.190" style="s2">you can get like outside of your own</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.790" end="00:39:54.140" style="s2">perspective to be able to translate any</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.190" end="00:39:56.660" style="s2">experience and so that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.140" end="00:39:59.210" style="s2">problem of this whole situation laman I</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.660" end="00:40:00.350" style="s2">was really struck by this your statement</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.210" end="00:40:02.900" style="s2">these different states of different</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.350" end="00:40:03.970" style="s2">logics I think he heard something along</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.900" end="00:40:06.980" style="s2">those lines</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.970" end="00:40:09.350" style="s2">remember and I couldn&#39;t agree more that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.980" end="00:40:11.690" style="s2">certain subtle states even when</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.350" end="00:40:14.540" style="s2">collectively enacted have different time</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.690" end="00:40:17.000" style="s2">spaces than say the so called gross</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.540" end="00:40:19.700" style="s2">mouth and thank certain kinds of low</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.000" end="00:40:21.650" style="s2">causal spaces work differently and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.700" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">might say they&#39;re a different lowboy to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.650" end="00:40:26.269" style="s2">the different states both</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:28.219" style="s2">and understood not just subjectively but</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.269" end="00:40:30.140" style="s2">all quadrant and then the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.219" end="00:40:32.209" style="s2">thing again I&#39;m echoing you about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.140" end="00:40:34.190" style="s2">interpenetration and how they work is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.209" end="00:40:35.449" style="s2">what happens with these different logics</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.190" end="00:40:37.489" style="s2">of these different states these</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.449" end="00:40:39.739" style="s2">different space times these different</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.489" end="00:40:42.170" style="s2">rhythms even one that Bonnie&#39;s pointing</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.739" end="00:40:44.420" style="s2">to the suspension of course in certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.170" end="00:40:47.059" style="s2">quote/unquote non dual States this</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.420" end="00:40:49.819" style="s2">really pushes the neo-kantian character</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.059" end="00:40:51.619" style="s2">of developmental psychology where the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.819" end="00:40:56.119" style="s2">sense of the world is structured through</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.619" end="00:40:59.180" style="s2">different schema historically including</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.119" end="00:41:01.670" style="s2">time and space I think this extends into</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.180" end="00:41:04.190" style="s2">these states you know beyond traditional</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.670" end="00:41:06.199" style="s2">state structures into States and for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.190" end="00:41:08.239" style="s2">and actually a group that lives here in</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.199" end="00:41:09.859" style="s2">Augusta this is one of our curiosities</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.239" end="00:41:12.769" style="s2">this is one of the things we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.859" end="00:41:15.259" style="s2">exploring is what is that what are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.769" end="00:41:17.209" style="s2">realities and so I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.259" end="00:41:20.209" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying and maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.209" end="00:41:21.229" style="s2">understanding a little better maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.209" end="00:41:24.799" style="s2">where you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.229" end="00:41:26.180" style="s2">I appreciate yeah so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.799" end="00:41:28.219" style="s2">highlight now we have a working</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.180" end="00:41:30.079" style="s2">definition of states versus state</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.219" end="00:41:32.239" style="s2">experience because it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:34.969" style="s2">world view we understand the world view</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.239" end="00:41:37.489" style="s2">is enacted by people who hold that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.969" end="00:41:40.279" style="s2">we can think of world views that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.489" end="00:41:43.339" style="s2">world view and so that&#39;s that state and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.279" end="00:41:46.759" style="s2">I would say that a world view a world</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.339" end="00:41:49.699" style="s2">view is born by certain assumptions and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.759" end="00:41:53.239" style="s2">cultures and language and this net it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.699" end="00:41:57.229" style="s2">very high kind of sophisticated part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.239" end="00:42:00.380" style="s2">being human but a stay is bounded by</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.229" end="00:42:03.729" style="s2">things like much more basic things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.380" end="00:42:07.900" style="s2">assumptions of a causality assumption of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.729" end="00:42:11.479" style="s2">agency assumption of relations in</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.900" end="00:42:13.999" style="s2">reality assumptions and perceptions not</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.479" end="00:42:16.969" style="s2">the idea of perceptions but literally</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.999" end="00:42:18.589" style="s2">what you see in a world view like if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.969" end="00:42:21.559" style="s2">have a certain worldview and you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.589" end="00:42:23.749" style="s2">black people you see threat right those</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.559" end="00:42:27.140" style="s2">are couple but in a state these are</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.749" end="00:42:30.619" style="s2">perceptual realms that are different</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.140" end="00:42:33.170" style="s2">like what you actually see is different</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.619" end="00:42:35.599" style="s2">in different states so I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.170" end="00:42:36.920" style="s2">if you think of them as worldviews that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.599" end="00:42:40.610" style="s2">you can enter</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.920" end="00:42:43.220" style="s2">or be bounded by this is a good modern</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.610" end="00:42:45.830" style="s2">definition of a state that is decoupled</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.220" end="00:42:48.380" style="s2">from the experience itself that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.830" end="00:42:50.600" style="s2">can enter a world view in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.380" end="00:42:53.270" style="s2">they can enter state or vice versa so</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.600" end="00:42:55.790" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good analogy and so like</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.270" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">the difference between the Jesus and my</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.790" end="00:43:00.770" style="s2">heart interpretation is that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:03.350" style="s2">be specific to a particular culture and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.770" end="00:43:06.590" style="s2">a particular tradition whereas a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.350" end="00:43:09.260" style="s2">description of like a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.590" end="00:43:11.180" style="s2">state is going to be universal to almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.260" end="00:43:12.710" style="s2">anybody no matter who you like we would</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.180" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">all agree that there are black people</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.710" end="00:43:16.790" style="s2">regardless of what different people</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">might think of them in the waking State</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.790" end="00:43:22.910" style="s2">there are black people I&#39;m taking that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:24.980" style="s2">slightly differently to say well here is</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.910" end="00:43:27.620" style="s2">like the belief that you have Jesus in</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.980" end="00:43:29.660" style="s2">your heart is part of your worldview but</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.620" end="00:43:32.690" style="s2">then there&#39;s something we&#39;re calling a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.660" end="00:43:34.730" style="s2">stay to which is what you have in common</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.690" end="00:43:36.530" style="s2">you know you have Jesus in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.730" end="00:43:38.270" style="s2">somebody else has rooted in their heart</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.530" end="00:43:40.790" style="s2">someone else just as love in their heart</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.270" end="00:43:43.310" style="s2">there&#39;s something in common it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.790" end="00:43:45.170" style="s2">fundamental than the worldview set of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.310" end="00:43:48.260" style="s2">beliefs and interpretations that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.170" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">shared and it&#39;s more by a physical basic</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.260" end="00:43:53.210" style="s2">perceptual and that&#39;s what we&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:54.890" style="s2">the state right right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.210" end="00:43:56.990" style="s2">difference between a universal</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.890" end="00:43:59.210" style="s2">description of the character of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.990" end="00:44:00.770" style="s2">going on versus like a particular</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.210" end="00:44:02.540" style="s2">translation or something</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.770" end="00:44:04.610" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s essentially pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.540" end="00:44:06.710" style="s2">the will becomes distinction that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.610" end="00:44:10.040" style="s2">can have this experience of unbounded</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.710" end="00:44:12.320" style="s2">love or empathy and there are many ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.040" end="00:44:13.970" style="s2">to interpret that state that is in</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.320" end="00:44:16.760" style="s2">common I&#39;ve been thinking about how I</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.970" end="00:44:18.410" style="s2">feel about Tom&#39;s ablative hypothesis but</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.760" end="00:44:20.840" style="s2">I think Bruce might want to keep us on</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.410" end="00:44:23.300" style="s2">track here what&#39;s up Layton what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.840" end="00:44:25.910" style="s2">mean it means to remove so that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.300" end="00:44:29.390" style="s2">proposition was that you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.910" end="00:44:31.340" style="s2">in Western culture we&#39;ve developed all</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.390" end="00:44:33.770" style="s2">this cognitive or thinking we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.340" end="00:44:35.090" style="s2">were way out balanced in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.770" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">certain part of the mind that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.090" end="00:44:39.500" style="s2">over functioning and if you strip that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:41.750" style="s2">away and if I find different techniques</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.500" end="00:44:43.490" style="s2">for putting it aside you have access to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.750" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">other kinds of experiences that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.490" end="00:44:47.900" style="s2">talking about and the more that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:50.390" style="s2">strip away maybe that we could call it</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.900" end="00:44:50.810" style="s2">the deeper States you have access to you</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.810" end="00:44:54.620" style="s2">say that I think what&#39;s important about</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.850" end="00:44:56.150" style="s2">these states is that there are ways of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.620" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">Unknowing rather than ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.150" end="00:45:02.720" style="s2">their modes of Unknowing and each mode</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:05.030" style="s2">is a place where you know more or a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.720" end="00:45:07.340" style="s2">different kind of thing that you which</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.030" end="00:45:09.620" style="s2">is the assumption cognitive or just</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.340" end="00:45:12.260" style="s2">embodied perceptual assumption that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.620" end="00:45:14.870" style="s2">used to have so then give an example of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.260" end="00:45:16.430" style="s2">that if I find a way to not only stop</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.870" end="00:45:18.830" style="s2">thinking that we&#39;re separate but to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.430" end="00:45:21.110" style="s2">experience that we&#39;re not separate and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.830" end="00:45:23.300" style="s2">fall in love with you in a moment it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.110" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">blade if something is stripped away you</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.300" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">know at some point in childhood time and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:29.660" style="s2">space were constructed it&#39;s part of my</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:32.090" style="s2">experience but if I find a way to put</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.660" end="00:45:34.010" style="s2">that aside and visit a place before time</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.090" end="00:45:36.440" style="s2">at space was constructed then I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.010" end="00:45:40.330" style="s2">timeless spaceless realm they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.440" end="00:45:40.330" style="s2">kind of a Glade of steps that open up</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.950" end="00:46:09.110" style="s2">yeah I think the point here is that he</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.100" end="00:46:11.360" style="s2">loves me and ablation and then building</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.110" end="00:46:14.420" style="s2">up new knowledge right so insight</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.360" end="00:46:19.100" style="s2">exactly right yeah you know so we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.420" end="00:46:22.370" style="s2">knowledge basic shared state waking</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.100" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">state and then you can actually if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.370" end="00:46:28.730" style="s2">had a community of practice you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:31.790" style="s2">actually build new knowledge new states</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.730" end="00:46:34.130" style="s2">based upon starting over at some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.790" end="00:46:35.870" style="s2">lower juncture or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.130" end="00:46:38.600" style="s2">this is step I borrow from Bonnie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.870" end="00:46:40.790" style="s2">heretical work considered she called it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.600" end="00:46:42.890" style="s2">inside practice so it&#39;s basically the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.790" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">idea if you have laid down and open up a</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.890" end="00:46:48.230" style="s2">space of possibilities then insights</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:50.450" style="s2">emerge from that open space and then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.230" end="00:46:53.090" style="s2">can take the next step which is more of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.450" end="00:46:55.190" style="s2">a constructive step and you can create</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.090" end="00:46:57.500" style="s2">new meaning and new understanding from</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.190" end="00:46:59.750" style="s2">that space but the important first step</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.500" end="00:47:03.380" style="s2">is the ablative step this constructive</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.750" end="00:47:04.190" style="s2">step interpretation what you do instead</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.380" end="00:47:06.830" style="s2">is experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.190" end="00:47:09.800" style="s2">you say like I had this experience once</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.830" end="00:47:11.180" style="s2">of driving down to my horses I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.800" end="00:47:13.580" style="s2">know what overcame me</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.180" end="00:47:14.930" style="s2">but literally I no longer saw them</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.580" end="00:47:17.540" style="s2">eating the grass</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.930" end="00:47:21.890" style="s2">I saw the grass growing horses it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.540" end="00:47:24.650" style="s2">literally a complete reframe of reality</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.890" end="00:47:26.870" style="s2">and I had to like shake myself out of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.650" end="00:47:28.970" style="s2">because like if you saw you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.870" end="00:47:30.890" style="s2">ultimately you would see the soil</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.970" end="00:47:34.970" style="s2">growing grasses you know what that feels</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.890" end="00:47:37.340" style="s2">like so the soil was growing so then I</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.970" end="00:47:40.750" style="s2">decided not to interpret that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.340" end="00:47:44.540" style="s2">experiment like what if I acted on that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.750" end="00:47:46.370" style="s2">way of thinking and so that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.540" end="00:47:48.740" style="s2">than interpreting it&#39;s just to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.370" end="00:47:50.540" style="s2">I had this gift is differently looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.740" end="00:47:52.910" style="s2">at things and say there&#39;s more effort</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.540" end="00:47:54.320" style="s2">into it right so I say no I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.910" end="00:47:57.110" style="s2">to do that because that&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.320" end="00:47:59.510" style="s2">interpretation I&#39;m gonna switch it as if</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.110" end="00:48:02.090" style="s2">it&#39;s that interpretation I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.510" end="00:48:04.040" style="s2">how you can explore these things without</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.090" end="00:48:06.080" style="s2">getting into some kind of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.040" end="00:48:08.120" style="s2">interpretation you just say well what if</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.080" end="00:48:10.580" style="s2">I structure my decision in my behavior</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.120" end="00:48:11.750" style="s2">based upon this way of looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.580" end="00:48:14.570" style="s2">versus the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.750" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">then what impulse from there and those</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.570" end="00:48:20.570" style="s2">are actually quite interesting I just</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:23.090" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t necessarily think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.570" end="00:48:25.010" style="s2">removal I think it&#39;s equally plausible</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.090" end="00:48:27.290" style="s2">to think of it as the addition of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.010" end="00:48:29.120" style="s2">counter force I&#39;d like to make a couple</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.290" end="00:48:30.470" style="s2">comments on that and I think again</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.120" end="00:48:32.090" style="s2">Bonnie said something that what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.470" end="00:48:34.100" style="s2">moves us in the next direction first</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.090" end="00:48:35.390" style="s2">just echoing on what Michael and Damon</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.100" end="00:48:37.640" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.390" end="00:48:40.340" style="s2">Charles tart who made a distinction that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.640" end="00:48:42.650" style="s2">we need state-specific sciences because</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.340" end="00:48:45.260" style="s2">different states have their own logics</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.650" end="00:48:47.450" style="s2">and worlds and time-space configurations</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.260" end="00:48:49.580" style="s2">and modes of causality and if we just</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.450" end="00:48:51.710" style="s2">try to import basically gross waking</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.580" end="00:48:53.330" style="s2">state assumptions into other states we</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.710" end="00:48:55.130" style="s2">may be unnecessarily limiting our</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.330" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">salicin he didn&#39;t have a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.130" end="00:48:59.540" style="s2">that I could see very concrete proposals</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:02.360" style="s2">yet but overall his intuition was that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.540" end="00:49:04.880" style="s2">we need to find different state specific</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.360" end="00:49:06.800" style="s2">modes of engaging with and exploring the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.880" end="00:49:08.870" style="s2">experiential worlds to see what we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.800" end="00:49:11.030" style="s2">learn from them and not to just collapse</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.870" end="00:49:12.890" style="s2">them all down to a single interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.030" end="00:49:14.510" style="s2">frame based on gross waking</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.890" end="00:49:16.610" style="s2">consciousness if we want to use Wilber&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.510" end="00:49:19.610" style="s2">language and also about the question</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.610" end="00:49:21.470" style="s2">ablation and removing or addition one</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.610" end="00:49:23.780" style="s2">way I think about it is kind of a not</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.470" end="00:49:25.790" style="s2">doing exercise and that could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.780" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">interpreted both as a removing but also</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.790" end="00:49:30.380" style="s2">has in addition in terms of you do</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">something that is basically not what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.380" end="00:49:35.210" style="s2">normally do you stop doing something</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:37.670" style="s2">that you habitually do and you flip</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.210" end="00:49:39.770" style="s2">experience in some way or flip your</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.670" end="00:49:42.020" style="s2">approach to experience that allows other</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.770" end="00:49:43.730" style="s2">things to open up and Michael Washburn</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.020" end="00:49:46.040" style="s2">gives some good examples there in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.730" end="00:49:48.770" style="s2">of just how mindfulness can work simple</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.040" end="00:49:51.170" style="s2">receptive attention basically disengages</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.770" end="00:49:53.990" style="s2">from the typical ego modes of direction</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.170" end="00:49:56.120" style="s2">and ordering of experience and as you</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.990" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">kind of let go of the habitual impulses</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.120" end="00:50:00.380" style="s2">of thought identified perceiver all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:02.060" style="s2">the activity that it normally does is</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.380" end="00:50:04.040" style="s2">thrown into relief that&#39;s our initial</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.060" end="00:50:06.380" style="s2">discovery of how busy our minds are but</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.040" end="00:50:08.540" style="s2">as we don&#39;t entertain that and as we</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.380" end="00:50:11.030" style="s2">disengage from that we begin to see</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.540" end="00:50:13.460" style="s2">disclosed domains of experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.030" end="00:50:14.690" style="s2">subliminal threshold type experiences</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.460" end="00:50:16.790" style="s2">and other kinds of experiences that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.690" end="00:50:18.980" style="s2">normally obscured by our habitual</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.790" end="00:50:21.350" style="s2">thought identified way of navigating the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.980" end="00:50:23.600" style="s2">world and so there is a kind of stop put</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.350" end="00:50:26.360" style="s2">on certain behaviors or certain modes of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.600" end="00:50:28.670" style="s2">engagement and as we allow that to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.360" end="00:50:30.710" style="s2">subside other dimensions of experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.670" end="00:50:32.360" style="s2">are opened up to us Michael</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.710" end="00:50:34.520" style="s2">Washburn talks about how we can move</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.360" end="00:50:36.350" style="s2">into deeper layers of the unconscious in</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.520" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">that way but I think making it broader</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.350" end="00:50:41.170" style="s2">in terms of castañeda or TSK or various</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:43.430" style="s2">other contemplative approaches just</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.170" end="00:50:45.830" style="s2">experimenting identifying the way that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.430" end="00:50:48.770" style="s2">we hold experience and choosing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.830" end="00:50:50.690" style="s2">deselect that and to entertain different</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.770" end="00:50:52.940" style="s2">modes of using our senses different</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.690" end="00:50:54.770" style="s2">patterns of breathing different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.940" end="00:50:57.470" style="s2">holding attention that can really begin</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.770" end="00:50:59.240" style="s2">to open up new territory and so to me as</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.470" end="00:51:01.160" style="s2">layman is suggesting there is something</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.240" end="00:51:02.930" style="s2">that seems to be both ablative and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.160" end="00:51:04.430" style="s2">additive at the same time in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.930" end="00:51:06.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a creative element to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.430" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">decision so in talking about that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.920" end="00:51:11.030" style="s2">like to just open it up since we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:14.140" style="s2">talking about this mode of experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.030" end="00:51:16.610" style="s2">for you how does state practice state</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.140" end="00:51:18.230" style="s2">experimentation training show up in your</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.610" end="00:51:19.610" style="s2">life what what do you engage in what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.230" end="00:51:21.800" style="s2">important for you in terms of your own</p>

<p begin="00:51:21.800" end="00:51:25.340" style="s2">this area I think one of the things</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.340" end="00:51:30.950" style="s2">confidence that you get from certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:33.470" style="s2">forms of intense seeming state</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.080" end="00:51:40.280" style="s2">in the transition into those states</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.880" end="00:51:42.140" style="s2">because of the seeming difference that</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.170" end="00:52:32.750" style="s2">something like a subtle energy flow</p>

<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:12.020" style="s2">favorites because when you go in you</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.650" end="00:53:13.640" style="s2">can&#39;t be sure everything is solved and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.020" end="00:53:16.070" style="s2">perfect but you have no way of telling</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.640" end="00:53:18.530" style="s2">that that isn&#39;t the case at those points</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.070" end="00:53:21.290" style="s2">for all I know everything is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.530" end="00:53:23.570" style="s2">complete and solved in that state you</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.290" end="00:53:25.220" style="s2">just can&#39;t tell that it isn&#39;t those are</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.570" end="00:53:27.260" style="s2">two of my favorites I guess what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.220" end="00:53:29.570" style="s2">talking about layman freshly like the</p>

<p begin="00:53:34.340" end="00:53:38.380" style="s2">deconstruct your sense of self but it</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.350" end="00:53:40.940" style="s2">kind of gives you a sort of stronger</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.380" end="00:53:43.190" style="s2">existential confidence like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.940" end="00:53:43.869" style="s2">saying because you&#39;ve been in that crazy</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.390" end="00:53:54.220" style="s2">I think a lot of people they take</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.069" end="00:53:56.109" style="s2">psychedelic drugs and their idea of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.220" end="00:53:58.059" style="s2">is like I&#39;m gonna let it take me where</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.109" end="00:54:00.309" style="s2">it wants to take me kind of a thing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.059" end="00:54:02.559" style="s2">that&#39;s not ever really been the way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.309" end="00:54:04.660" style="s2">I have approached it at least not like</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.559" end="00:54:07.539" style="s2">waking state kind of psychedelic drugs</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.660" end="00:54:08.349" style="s2">like your LSD s and your mushrooms and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.539" end="00:54:10.359" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.349" end="00:54:13.180" style="s2">I like that almost more as like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.359" end="00:54:15.099" style="s2">challenge am I gonna be able to keep my</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.180" end="00:54:17.380" style="s2">shit together and a lot of times I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.099" end="00:54:20.589" style="s2">even put myself in sort of extreme</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.380" end="00:54:22.660" style="s2">situations in those extreme states to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.589" end="00:54:24.460" style="s2">sort of test myself and gain my strength</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.660" end="00:54:26.349" style="s2">and stuff I don&#39;t really do that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.460" end="00:54:28.930" style="s2">much anymore I feel like almost even</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.349" end="00:54:31.059" style="s2">slightly more intimidated by it now that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.930" end="00:54:33.460" style="s2">I&#39;m a little bit older like oh man I</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.059" end="00:54:35.499" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I&#39;m quite feeling ready to</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.460" end="00:54:37.480" style="s2">have my whole world shook today I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.499" end="00:54:39.460" style="s2">really ready to take a good hard look in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.480" end="00:54:42.759" style="s2">the mirror like that I think now a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.460" end="00:54:45.279" style="s2">more of my spiritual experiences mostly</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.759" end="00:54:48.130" style="s2">if some kind of karma yoga or like some</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.279" end="00:54:49.869" style="s2">kind of a pagan self creation kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.130" end="00:54:51.640" style="s2">practice and this is actually I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.869" end="00:54:54.220" style="s2">something that we don&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.640" end="00:54:55.930" style="s2">hardly at all if ever in the integral</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.220" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">circles it&#39;s very much about Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.930" end="00:54:59.859" style="s2">and this kind of being practice you</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:01.930" style="s2">don&#39;t really hear too much about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.859" end="00:55:03.730" style="s2">creative becoming but this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.930" end="00:55:05.710" style="s2">that a different approach to even</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.730" end="00:55:08.499" style="s2">psychedelics to of like whether you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.710" end="00:55:10.180" style="s2">think that being conscious is about just</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.499" end="00:55:11.739" style="s2">sort of being here now and letting</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.180" end="00:55:14.769" style="s2">things flow and going with the flow</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.739" end="00:55:17.559" style="s2">versus being conscious as in consciously</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.769" end="00:55:20.619" style="s2">creating so I think that&#39;s kind of a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.559" end="00:55:22.720" style="s2">that I do spiritual practice that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.619" end="00:55:25.180" style="s2">think is maybe different from some other</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.720" end="00:55:27.549" style="s2">people is I have the concept in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.180" end="00:55:30.369" style="s2">about my higher self and my attributes</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.549" end="00:55:32.799" style="s2">and characteristics of what that is and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.369" end="00:55:35.170" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working on becoming that</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.799" end="00:55:37.480" style="s2">higher self through practice and in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.170" end="00:55:40.059" style="s2">interactions with other people I see it</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.480" end="00:55:42.099" style="s2">all as like an opportunity for spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.059" end="00:55:43.960" style="s2">practice like this is a chance for me to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.099" end="00:55:47.019" style="s2">live it and to be awesome and to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.960" end="00:55:49.749" style="s2">sympathetic and compassionate to listen</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.019" end="00:55:51.940" style="s2">and to be godly SH to this person be</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.749" end="00:55:53.619" style="s2">that within the Buddhist tradition or</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.940" end="00:55:55.509" style="s2">the Christian tradition or the pagan</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.619" end="00:55:57.130" style="s2">tradition to me they all kind of start</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.509" end="00:55:59.349" style="s2">to overlap around sir</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.130" end="00:56:01.660" style="s2">ideas I definitely include some</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.349" end="00:56:03.970" style="s2">practicing the power of now and</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.660" end="00:56:06.519" style="s2">mindfulness practices and I use</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.970" end="00:56:08.740" style="s2">progressive relaxation techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.519" end="00:56:10.569" style="s2">stuff to go to sleep at night so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.740" end="00:56:12.430" style="s2">incorporating stuff from a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.569" end="00:56:14.829" style="s2">different traditions I kind of feel like</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.430" end="00:56:17.799" style="s2">the ultimate goal of an integral</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.829" end="00:56:19.990" style="s2">spiritual practice is not to find some</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.799" end="00:56:22.089" style="s2">kind of like cookie cutter technique</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.990" end="00:56:23.349" style="s2">from each quadrant or something but to</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.089" end="00:56:25.450" style="s2">make sure that you&#39;re touching each</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.349" end="00:56:27.910" style="s2">quadrant and that you have practices</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.450" end="00:56:29.859" style="s2">that work for you in your life in each</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.910" end="00:56:33.039" style="s2">quadrant so that way you can really have</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.859" end="00:56:35.380" style="s2">a holistic perspective and approach so</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.039" end="00:56:39.579" style="s2">I&#39;ve engaged in a lot of state training</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.380" end="00:56:41.740" style="s2">in many traditions for 20 years continue</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.579" end="00:56:43.480" style="s2">to do so it&#39;s always changing what</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.740" end="00:56:46.599" style="s2">practices work one of the latest</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.480" end="00:56:50.039" style="s2">iterations is working with serving first</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.599" end="00:56:51.789" style="s2">son practices finding very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.039" end="00:56:54.940" style="s2">multi-dimensional but I would actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.789" end="00:56:57.609" style="s2">say that my main practice right now is</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.940" end="00:57:00.750" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s actually about in</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.609" end="00:57:05.740" style="s2">coronating and embodying in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.750" end="00:57:08.109" style="s2">effective open creative kind way in my</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.740" end="00:57:10.779" style="s2">day to day relationships relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.109" end="00:57:13.029" style="s2">has really become my primary practice I</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.779" end="00:57:15.039" style="s2">really like that answer by the way about</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.029" end="00:57:17.230" style="s2">relationships I think that&#39;s what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.039" end="00:57:19.900" style="s2">for me I think the most important and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.230" end="00:57:23.049" style="s2">the most difficult thing that I do is</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.900" end="00:57:26.980" style="s2">just taking as many moments during the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.049" end="00:57:28.809" style="s2">day as I can to stop and drop in to some</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.980" end="00:57:31.059" style="s2">sense of what all those other practices</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.809" end="00:57:34.269" style="s2">might reveal for me the state practices</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.059" end="00:57:36.039" style="s2">so I like layman&#39;s word soft explosion</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.269" end="00:57:38.349" style="s2">so it&#39;s like trying to drop into that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.039" end="00:57:41.740" style="s2">soft explosion of awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.349" end="00:57:44.289" style="s2">coherence that is available underneath</p>

<p begin="00:57:44.289" end="00:57:49.150" style="s2">can tell that feels like the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:51.819" style="s2">that&#39;s most important and then I live in</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.150" end="00:57:54.069" style="s2">a very progressive part of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.819" end="00:57:56.980" style="s2">I&#39;m lucky to have a lot of opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.069" end="00:57:59.500" style="s2">and exposure to all kinds of things so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.980" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">get state experiences in state training</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.500" end="00:58:05.230" style="s2">and improvisational dance and breath</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:07.720" style="s2">work and sort of like group ritual stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.230" end="00:58:09.549" style="s2">and group practices like circling and</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.720" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">foam dialog experimentation with</p>

<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:21.640" style="s2">end of Tibetan tradition so it feels</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.170" end="00:58:23.589" style="s2">like just a hodgepodge of all those</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.640" end="00:58:25.329" style="s2">things that kind of knock my states</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.589" end="00:58:27.790" style="s2">around but it&#39;s sort of that daily</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.329" end="00:58:30.099" style="s2">practice of trying to let go and dip</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.790" end="00:58:32.500" style="s2">into whatever those other experiences</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.099" end="00:58:38.109" style="s2">reveal that seem the most important I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.500" end="00:58:44.410" style="s2">never been I&#39;ve had many many many</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.109" end="00:58:47.829" style="s2">different experiences been kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.410" end="00:58:50.920" style="s2">explorer of what exactly was going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.829" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">when I&#39;m toying with right now is could</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.920" end="00:58:57.970" style="s2">name a couple of neo animism which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:59.650" style="s2">the experience of seeing agency in Omni</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.970" end="00:59:02.619" style="s2">direction so it&#39;s all talked about</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.650" end="00:59:05.410" style="s2">coffee moves hundreds of people every</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.619" end="00:59:07.690" style="s2">day and how the natural world moves us</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.410" end="00:59:10.119" style="s2">instead of us moving the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.690" end="00:59:12.520" style="s2">and one of the implications for that to</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.119" end="00:59:14.890" style="s2">really kind of come to terms with us as</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.520" end="00:59:17.770" style="s2">being an equal participant in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.890" end="00:59:20.109" style="s2">natural world and not D animating any</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.770" end="00:59:23.500" style="s2">part of the natural world and when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.109" end="00:59:27.010" style="s2">walk around in that kind of state</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.500" end="00:59:29.890" style="s2">experience than reality is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.010" end="00:59:33.160" style="s2">less anthropocentric so just practicing</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.890" end="00:59:35.770" style="s2">that kind of neo animism is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.160" end="00:59:38.770" style="s2">that I do also I&#39;ve been working a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.770" end="00:59:42.130" style="s2">with perception and the limitations of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.770" end="00:59:45.640" style="s2">perception and trying to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.130" end="00:59:48.310" style="s2">without interpretive framework so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.640" end="00:59:50.170" style="s2">easy in nature like to not proceed</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.310" end="00:59:52.930" style="s2">without interpretive frameworks and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.170" end="00:59:55.119" style="s2">animals come to you and all this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.930" end="00:59:57.609" style="s2">stuff happens but also trying to do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.119" end="01:00:01.690" style="s2">when I&#39;m with people and in workshops</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.609" end="01:00:03.839" style="s2">and I&#39;m noticing how transformative and</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.690" end="01:00:06.130" style="s2">in fact you can have when you are</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.839" end="01:00:09.010" style="s2">dialoguing without a lot of interpretive</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.130" end="01:00:11.619" style="s2">frameworks and just kind of dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.010" end="01:00:14.890" style="s2">the perceptions and in a kind of non</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.619" end="01:00:17.290" style="s2">judgmental way so those are two kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.890" end="01:00:19.230" style="s2">different states of awareness different</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.290" end="01:00:21.640" style="s2">views I would call them that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.230" end="01:00:23.980" style="s2">practicing with well I might throw a</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.640" end="01:00:25.750" style="s2">couple more in here because it</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.980" end="01:00:28.450" style="s2">first me listening to all of you that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.750" end="01:00:30.609" style="s2">most of what I do isn&#39;t characterized by</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.450" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">the types of states I gave examples of</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.609" end="01:00:35.800" style="s2">earlier most of what I consider to be my</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:37.930" style="s2">practice is a kind of blending practice</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.800" end="01:00:39.700" style="s2">you know in the talk I gave I was trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.930" end="01:00:41.470" style="s2">to make a distinction between what I</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.700" end="01:00:44.109" style="s2">would call spirituality and mysticism</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.470" end="01:00:45.850" style="s2">where mysticism focuses on States and</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.109" end="01:00:48.040" style="s2">spirituality might try to balance them</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.850" end="01:00:50.530" style="s2">out that kind of balancing whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.040" end="01:00:52.990" style="s2">between myself and another person or a</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.530" end="01:00:55.240" style="s2">lot of the time between what seems like</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.990" end="01:00:57.910" style="s2">my conscious and unconscious mind make</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.240" end="01:00:59.290" style="s2">up a big part of my regular practice now</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.910" end="01:01:02.170" style="s2">whether it&#39;s little kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.290" end="01:01:04.390" style="s2">proprioceptive nuances in tracking the</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.170" end="01:01:06.369" style="s2">sensations of how another part of me is</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.390" end="01:01:08.530" style="s2">responding to information and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.369" end="01:01:10.810" style="s2">let it be a full participant or whether</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.530" end="01:01:13.150" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of neo shamanic practices in</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.810" end="01:01:15.010" style="s2">which there&#39;s a mild transient location</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.150" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">or I do a lot of hypnotherapy with</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.010" end="01:01:18.820" style="s2">people and very similar kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:21.369" style="s2">processes and all these things where</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.820" end="01:01:23.260" style="s2">there&#39;s an attempt to not remove the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.369" end="01:01:25.960" style="s2">ordinary conscious personality but to</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.260" end="01:01:28.630" style="s2">have it operating roughly in parity with</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.960" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">some other more decentralized seeming</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.630" end="01:01:34.270" style="s2">subject of intelligence system and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.640" end="01:01:36.880" style="s2">accompanying that is generally diffused</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.270" end="01:01:40.150" style="s2">sense of intensified beingness which I</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.880" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">prize above any particular state then in</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.150" end="01:01:44.350" style="s2">addition to that there is something I</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:47.080" style="s2">like quite a bit which is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.350" end="01:01:49.750" style="s2">bring intellect emotion and sensation</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.080" end="01:01:51.940" style="s2">online in approximately equal amounts at</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.750" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">the same time and that can be in</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.940" end="01:01:57.730" style="s2">perceiving things try to perceive my</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:02:00.400" style="s2">thoughts feelings and sensory perceptual</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.730" end="01:02:02.230" style="s2">experience of them in equal balance or</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.400" end="01:02:04.660" style="s2">it can be just in checking those systems</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.230" end="01:02:06.910" style="s2">in myself and that seems to create an</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.660" end="01:02:08.200" style="s2">intensified vividness that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.910" end="01:02:11.140" style="s2">necessarily fall into the one of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.200" end="01:02:12.910" style="s2">four states that&#39;s really it might lean</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.140" end="01:02:14.740" style="s2">a little bit toward the subtle because I</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.910" end="01:02:18.010" style="s2">feel like that&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.740" end="01:02:20.260" style="s2">catalyzes the experience of a variety of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.010" end="01:02:22.300" style="s2">subtle energy flow experiences which I</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.260" end="01:02:24.609" style="s2">also do quite a bit of whatever their</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.300" end="01:02:27.340" style="s2">real significance of that it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.609" end="01:02:29.650" style="s2">say but it certainly seems that holding</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.340" end="01:02:31.780" style="s2">roughly equivalent balancing of mental</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.650" end="01:02:34.090" style="s2">emotional and sensory whole field</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.780" end="01:02:37.390" style="s2">experience in the same moment creates</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.090" end="01:02:39.850" style="s2">the kind of conductivity that permits me</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.390" end="01:02:42.010" style="s2">have seemingly subtle energy experiences</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.850" end="01:02:45.820" style="s2">I&#39;m noticing that as we&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.010" end="01:02:49.030" style="s2">conversation the globe in the world is</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.820" end="01:02:50.560" style="s2">having its own state transition and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.030" end="01:02:52.360" style="s2">you can sort of see things getting</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.560" end="01:02:54.550" style="s2">darker in the background I happen to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.360" end="01:02:57.220" style="s2">sitting outside it&#39;s more of a contrast</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.550" end="01:02:59.290" style="s2">here but see with everybody how that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.220" end="01:03:02.440" style="s2">lighting has been shifting their earth</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.290" end="01:03:04.960" style="s2">turns around us and changes its state</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.440" end="01:03:07.450" style="s2">what strikes me is interesting when I</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.960" end="01:03:09.430" style="s2">hear us all describe the kinds of states</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.450" end="01:03:11.380" style="s2">that we like in the kind of practices</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.430" end="01:03:14.140" style="s2">that we do is that even if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.380" end="01:03:16.510" style="s2">about trying to take a non conceptual or</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.140" end="01:03:18.250" style="s2">pre conceptual perspective like a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.510" end="01:03:20.350" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do is rooted in</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.250" end="01:03:22.810" style="s2">these stories that we tell ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.350" end="01:03:24.580" style="s2">about how to think about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.810" end="01:03:27.340" style="s2">doing it&#39;s really interesting the kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.580" end="01:03:28.720" style="s2">of storytelling element that&#39;s around it</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.340" end="01:03:30.790" style="s2">like I think that&#39;s what I think about</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.720" end="01:03:33.280" style="s2">even in the magic kind of tradition the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.790" end="01:03:35.500" style="s2">pagan tradition is that a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.280" end="01:03:37.840" style="s2">like believing in things and willing</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.500" end="01:03:40.210" style="s2">them to be by telling stories and sign</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.840" end="01:03:42.370" style="s2">of casting spells and maybe that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.210" end="01:03:44.770" style="s2">of what laymen you&#39;re talking about with</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.370" end="01:03:46.750" style="s2">these kind of koenz and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.770" end="01:03:48.580" style="s2">is like how to put yourself in a thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.750" end="01:03:51.400" style="s2">experiment that produces a particular</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.580" end="01:03:53.350" style="s2">kind of set of results well it does seem</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.400" end="01:03:55.060" style="s2">like if I think about a Cohen for</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.350" end="01:03:56.260" style="s2">example you take it apart you put it</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.060" end="01:03:58.090" style="s2">back together you go in at different</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.260" end="01:04:00.010" style="s2">angles and at different tempos but one</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.090" end="01:04:02.620" style="s2">of the things you do is it is as if</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.010" end="01:04:04.540" style="s2">you&#39;re tracing a path over again and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.620" end="01:04:07.030" style="s2">again and again moving through a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.540" end="01:04:09.100" style="s2">a structure which a story also is and</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.030" end="01:04:11.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of computational or</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.100" end="01:04:13.240" style="s2">algorithmic element to that think about</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.290" end="01:04:15.760" style="s2">the fractal where you you&#39;re gonna run a</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.240" end="01:04:17.410" style="s2">particular pattern configuration and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.760" end="01:04:19.690" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily get a result but if</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.410" end="01:04:21.490" style="s2">you run that pattern configuration the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.690" end="01:04:23.290" style="s2">same style of patterning configuration</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.490" end="01:04:25.780" style="s2">enough times all of a sudden you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.290" end="01:04:27.340" style="s2">your beautiful strange attractor for the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.780" end="01:04:29.920" style="s2">fractal computation so there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.340" end="01:04:31.960" style="s2">things that might pop up through a story</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.920" end="01:04:34.150" style="s2">or through a structure that we use if we</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.960" end="01:04:37.030" style="s2">go through it enough times the right way</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.150" end="01:04:39.310" style="s2">then you get the bonus payoff yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.030" end="01:04:41.230" style="s2">make music and stuff too so like one of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.310" end="01:04:42.910" style="s2">the mantras that I&#39;ve included into some</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.230" end="01:04:45.340" style="s2">of my music and that I&#39;ve kind of sung</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.910" end="01:04:47.560" style="s2">to myself is this all is impermanent all</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.340" end="01:04:49.870" style="s2">is without itself and so it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.560" end="01:04:51.190" style="s2">can say that in one way and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.870" end="01:04:52.750" style="s2">all is impermanent</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.190" end="01:04:54.819" style="s2">all is without itself and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.750" end="01:04:56.770" style="s2">freeing and it&#39;s beautiful it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.819" end="01:04:58.540" style="s2">anthem and then you could say it again</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.770" end="01:05:00.640" style="s2">in another way to yourself and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.540" end="01:05:02.650" style="s2">all is impermanent all is without itself</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.640" end="01:05:04.630" style="s2">you know you you feel that impermanence</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.650" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">and like the kind of pain and loss that</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.630" end="01:05:09.730" style="s2">goes with it so it&#39;s like that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:12.130" style="s2">beautiful paradox of multiple entendre</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.730" end="01:05:14.440" style="s2">z&#39; and multiple ways of feeling about</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.130" end="01:05:16.420" style="s2">like a particular idea from different</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.440" end="01:05:18.700" style="s2">perspectives even within yourself kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.420" end="01:05:21.250" style="s2">of opens up this funhouse mirror of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.700" end="01:05:24.099" style="s2">self to the self how it all feels about</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.250" end="01:05:26.410" style="s2">itself I resonated with a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.099" end="01:05:28.990" style="s2">all of you said and I also have not</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.410" end="01:05:31.150" style="s2">remained anchored in a single tradition</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.990" end="01:05:33.430" style="s2">for a long time but I have practiced</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.150" end="01:05:35.890" style="s2">fairly extensively within the bamako</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.430" end="01:05:38.619" style="s2">tradition especially in mother Tantra</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.890" end="01:05:40.300" style="s2">and so Chen traditions of the lineage</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.619" end="01:05:42.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a lot of practice in</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.300" end="01:05:45.010" style="s2">time-space knowledge or TSK I</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.730" end="01:05:46.900" style="s2">experimented with diamond approach</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.010" end="01:05:49.180" style="s2">actually I did diamond approach work for</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.900" end="01:05:51.160" style="s2">about five years with a teacher and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.180" end="01:05:53.560" style="s2">was a really good and generative period</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.160" end="01:05:55.420" style="s2">for me mostly it&#39;s similar to what some</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.560" end="01:05:57.609" style="s2">of you have described and that it</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.420" end="01:06:00.099" style="s2">doesn&#39;t often show up these days in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.609" end="01:06:03.250" style="s2">formal sitting period but more has to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.099" end="01:06:05.470" style="s2">with how I hold and relate to the whole</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.250" end="01:06:07.240" style="s2">constellation of my experience and work</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.470" end="01:06:09.700" style="s2">with that in in different contexts</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.240" end="01:06:12.819" style="s2">throughout the day so I like to live in</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.700" end="01:06:14.560" style="s2">inquiry in pursuing questions sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.819" end="01:06:16.450" style="s2">they&#39;re verbal questions but sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.560" end="01:06:18.819" style="s2">they&#39;re just holding a mode of</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.450" end="01:06:20.800" style="s2">experience and awareness to see what</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.819" end="01:06:23.560" style="s2">else I can see there to see what might</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.800" end="01:06:25.780" style="s2">be implicit within it or that might open</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.560" end="01:06:27.790" style="s2">up and shift the steady practice I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.780" end="01:06:30.040" style="s2">had for a long time it&#39;s just watching</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.790" end="01:06:31.869" style="s2">the movement of thoughts or the movement</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.040" end="01:06:33.940" style="s2">of consciousness and awareness and</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.869" end="01:06:36.490" style="s2">tracking that and going deeper with that</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.940" end="01:06:38.770" style="s2">that&#39;s opened up for me some of my most</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.490" end="01:06:41.470" style="s2">powerful moments of decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.770" end="01:06:43.710" style="s2">expanded ecstatic awareness where the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.470" end="01:06:46.210" style="s2">whole body and world scape seems</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.710" end="01:06:48.730" style="s2">transformed and being a father now</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.210" end="01:06:50.920" style="s2">watching my son approach the end of his</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.730" end="01:06:53.530" style="s2">school years and family practice and</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.920" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">relational practice is really important</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.530" end="01:06:57.460" style="s2">for me and really working with my</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:06:59.020" style="s2">students I don&#39;t often really think of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.460" end="01:07:00.790" style="s2">them as students but as people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.020" end="01:07:02.200" style="s2">engaging within the university and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.790" end="01:07:03.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a really a lot of really</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.200" end="01:07:05.349" style="s2">precious opportunity for heart</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.730" end="01:07:07.660" style="s2">engagement with people who are all</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.349" end="01:07:09.519" style="s2">deeply questioning and passionate about</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.660" end="01:07:11.259" style="s2">life and working towards their own</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.519" end="01:07:13.089" style="s2">betterment and transformation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.259" end="01:07:14.529" style="s2">really wonderful to just engage with</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.089" end="01:07:16.329" style="s2">people there so I think that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.529" end="01:07:18.729" style="s2">recently you know in the last few years</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.329" end="01:07:20.589" style="s2">with some of my writings in integral</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.729" end="01:07:23.349" style="s2">grand metrology somewhat along the lines</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.589" end="01:07:24.539" style="s2">of my TSK practice sometimes I just look</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.349" end="01:07:27.309" style="s2">at the different grammatical</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.539" end="01:07:29.229" style="s2">philosophies as modes of ontological</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.309" end="01:07:31.299" style="s2">experience and I experiment with</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.229" end="01:07:32.979" style="s2">combining them and shifting them and</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.299" end="01:07:35.019" style="s2">modulating them in different ways just</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.979" end="01:07:37.809" style="s2">to see what happens to my experience</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.019" end="01:07:39.339" style="s2">afield that&#39;s related I had a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.809" end="01:07:41.499" style="s2">practice for a number of years many</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.339" end="01:07:44.829" style="s2">years ago of actually trying to immerse</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.499" end="01:07:47.319" style="s2">myself in very alien languages just to</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.829" end="01:07:49.599" style="s2">see what shifted in my experience of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.319" end="01:07:51.069" style="s2">world as I learned to make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.599" end="01:07:53.499" style="s2">things from some pretty different</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.069" end="01:07:55.569" style="s2">presuppositional sets so I&#39;m not doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.499" end="01:07:58.119" style="s2">that now but that same general</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.569" end="01:08:00.430" style="s2">exploratory sensibility is still there</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.119" end="01:08:02.469" style="s2">it still shows up in other contexts so</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.430" end="01:08:04.299" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re probably approaching an end</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.469" end="01:08:07.509" style="s2">here and the last question I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.299" end="01:08:10.690" style="s2">ask all of you is if you could corral</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.509" end="01:08:13.449" style="s2">our various shared insights and concerns</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.690" end="01:08:15.670" style="s2">and perspectives into a single luminous</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.449" end="01:08:17.409" style="s2">sphere at least momentarily appearing</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.670" end="01:08:19.210" style="s2">one what would you do what&#39;s your take</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.409" end="01:08:21.369" style="s2">away what if we kind of shared together</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.210" end="01:08:23.290" style="s2">what what&#39;s the whole picture that</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.369" end="01:08:25.839" style="s2">you&#39;re merging with at the end here and</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.290" end="01:08:27.909" style="s2">does it suggest any avenues forward any</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.839" end="01:08:32.819" style="s2">horizons that who may yet to explore</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.909" end="01:08:37.060" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll start by seeing what I say I</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.819" end="01:08:39.940" style="s2">felt really excited and hopeful about</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.060" end="01:08:42.219" style="s2">the ways that we intertwined and agreed</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.940" end="01:08:45.250" style="s2">and also the ways that we diverged and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.219" end="01:08:47.679" style="s2">in different creative ways I just felt</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.250" end="01:08:49.540" style="s2">so good about the way we kind of fleshed</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.679" end="01:08:51.969" style="s2">out his face and feel like we were</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.540" end="01:08:54.940" style="s2">developing some foundational grounding</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.969" end="01:08:58.270" style="s2">so ya know feels good and I also have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.940" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">question in mind which is what would it</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.270" end="01:09:04.719" style="s2">be like for us to work with different</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.319" end="01:09:07.270" style="s2">kinds of injunctions to set the stage</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.719" end="01:09:09.759" style="s2">for a certain kind of state experience</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.270" end="01:09:11.560" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a Cohen or bomb dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.759" end="01:09:13.869" style="s2">set of injunctions or something like</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.560" end="01:09:17.049" style="s2">that and play with several of those and</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.869" end="01:09:18.819" style="s2">see what emerges from grounding in</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.049" end="01:09:19.750" style="s2">different states so what emerges from</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.819" end="01:09:22.060" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.750" end="01:09:24.570" style="s2">that&#39;s just a fun imaginary that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.060" end="01:09:27.340" style="s2">floating through my mind right now I</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.570" end="01:09:29.380" style="s2">don&#39;t have a general summary feel like</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.340" end="01:09:31.720" style="s2">one could come but I&#39;m not really at</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.380" end="01:09:33.820" style="s2">that place yet I like all of you I feel</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.720" end="01:09:35.770" style="s2">like I could spend several hours going</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.820" end="01:09:37.300" style="s2">down this path with each of you and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.770" end="01:09:40.240" style="s2">they could come back on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.300" end="01:09:42.520" style="s2">maybe more than a statement or picture I</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.240" end="01:09:44.140" style="s2">have the experience I&#39;ve been going</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.520" end="01:09:46.720" style="s2">through for the last little while very</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.140" end="01:09:48.430" style="s2">tingly on my face and my palms and</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.720" end="01:09:51.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a very pleasant pressure up my</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.430" end="01:09:52.600" style="s2">spine particularly just behind the bone</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.130" end="01:09:55.300" style="s2">of my nose is where it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.600" end="01:10:05.140" style="s2">intense so that indicates to me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.300" end="01:10:10.270" style="s2">something I like going on here you see</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.140" end="01:10:12.670" style="s2">that I know is your nose I could feel</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.270" end="01:10:22.600" style="s2">that so that&#39;s like some things that</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.670" end="01:10:24.220" style="s2">open up okay this is all very I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.600" end="01:10:27.040" style="s2">most of this kind of thing was hidden</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.220" end="01:10:31.300" style="s2">behind secret chamber for millennia I</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.040" end="01:10:32.980" style="s2">think this is just the beginning notion</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.300" end="01:10:41.860" style="s2">of States is going to be cracked wide</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.980" end="01:10:51.400" style="s2">open probably still around yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.860" end="01:10:55.230" style="s2">think it&#39;s really exciting I really like</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.400" end="01:10:58.030" style="s2">Tom&#39;s idea of us all coming up with some</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.230" end="01:11:01.630" style="s2">injunctions as thought experiments and</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.030" end="01:11:04.150" style="s2">may I suggest that as a potential part 3</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.630" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">for this series where we all think of a</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.150" end="01:11:08.440" style="s2">talk where we like come up with three or</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:10.750" style="s2">four different injunctions as</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.440" end="01:11:12.850" style="s2">suggestions or something like that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.750" end="01:11:14.980" style="s2">it could be a shorter video but I like</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.850" end="01:11:17.680" style="s2">that idea because we&#39;ve all come up with</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.980" end="01:11:19.720" style="s2">some good ideas of injunctions when</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.680" end="01:11:22.180" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about these practices and</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.720" end="01:11:24.820" style="s2">I mean like I think even being a</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.180" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">philosopher is like a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.820" end="01:11:29.140" style="s2">spiritual practice to like not make it</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:31.510" style="s2">personal not take it personal kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.140" end="01:11:33.159" style="s2">die to your ego and just go after the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.510" end="01:11:35.560" style="s2">truth I&#39;d be down to make</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.159" end="01:11:38.050" style="s2">part three about injunctions if you guys</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.560" end="01:11:39.790" style="s2">would be down in summation I really</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.050" end="01:11:41.260" style="s2">enjoy the talk I guess I kind of wish we</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.790" end="01:11:43.540" style="s2">would have been able to take a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.260" end="01:11:46.000" style="s2">bit more time today again a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.540" end="01:11:47.560" style="s2">deeper to each other&#39;s perspectives as</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.000" end="01:11:50.050" style="s2">well I mean I got a list of questions</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.560" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">here I wanted to ask people and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.050" end="01:11:53.590" style="s2">really get to it but it was a really</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:56.590" style="s2">enjoyable talk with y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.590" end="01:11:59.050" style="s2">for example layman Michael and I all</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.590" end="01:12:01.000" style="s2">seem to agree that the different</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.050" end="01:12:02.679" style="s2">practices and different states were</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.000" end="01:12:04.630" style="s2">separate and you could be good at one</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.679" end="01:12:06.400" style="s2">but not the other I would have liked to</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.630" end="01:12:08.739" style="s2">know if other people thought that was</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.400" end="01:12:10.840" style="s2">true as well I don&#39;t know but yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.739" end="01:12:13.210" style="s2">really enjoyed the talk I feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.840" end="01:12:15.340" style="s2">bringing some benefit to the integral</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.210" end="01:12:16.960" style="s2">community some much-needed discussion</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.340" end="01:12:19.810" style="s2">around this and hopefully if it will</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.960" end="01:12:22.179" style="s2">just get people starting to realize that</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.810" end="01:12:24.489" style="s2">there is still a diversity of</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.179" end="01:12:26.800" style="s2">perspectives around this stuff and that</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.489" end="01:12:29.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not just as simple as it might be</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.800" end="01:12:31.540" style="s2">presented that Wilbur is kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.260" end="01:12:34.090" style="s2">first voice in this conversation it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.540" end="01:12:36.250" style="s2">to us to take it up and to to take it</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.090" end="01:12:38.409" style="s2">further and to refine it into the future</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.250" end="01:12:39.580" style="s2">and to argue about this stuff that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.409" end="01:12:41.260" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about philosophy as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.580" end="01:12:42.699" style="s2">spiritual practice you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.260" end="01:12:45.550" style="s2">beautiful thing I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.699" end="01:12:47.320" style="s2">happened in some summary way there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.550" end="01:12:49.960" style="s2">many directions but it feels like</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.320" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">something began to open up and for</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.960" end="01:12:53.290" style="s2">myself there&#39;s a sense of real</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:55.420" style="s2">connection and Trust for me there&#39;s a</p>
