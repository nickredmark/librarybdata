<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.200" style="s2">hello everyone the episode you&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.340" end="00:00:06.509" style="s2">to see has held up our YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.200" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">for a while it was recorded remotely in</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.509" end="00:00:10.650" style="s2">New York City along with two other</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">episodes and apparently it is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.650" end="00:00:15.059" style="s2">blurry we couldn&#39;t control for it we</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">tried correcting it digitally but that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.059" end="00:00:18.960" style="s2">meant with only limited success there</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:21.600" style="s2">was a question about whether to release</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:23.580" style="s2">a still image over this audio but we</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">decided instead to release the blurred</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.580" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">product because in fact it is a visual</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">episode with artists London&#39;s eye we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.410" end="00:00:31.410" style="s2">hope we&#39;ve made the right decision we</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">apologize for the blurriness and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.410" end="00:00:35.399" style="s2">fact that it has held up the sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">releases but given that we&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.399" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">decided to bite the bullet we hope to</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">return to releasing episodes on a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:43.230" style="s2">regular basis on this channel we hope</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">you like it we think very highly of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.230" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">London sigh and we hope to have him back</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:01:00.600" style="s2">on the program hopefully with a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">bit better focus hello you found the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.600" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">portal</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:05.970" style="s2">I&#39;m your host Eric Weinstein and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">here in Manhattan with artists London</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.970" end="00:01:11.070" style="s2">psy a person I&#39;ve been looking to meet</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:12.600" style="s2">for quite some time and I just met him</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.070" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">yesterday for the first time London</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.600" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">welcome thank you so I have been eyeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">your artwork for years on the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve used it in talks and you are one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:27.720" style="s2">the most important people that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">come on the portal even though very few</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.720" end="00:01:32.189" style="s2">people know who you are or what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">been up to can you say a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.189" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">about your background as a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">artist of my background so my background</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">as an artist well I studied mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">an undergrad and maybe I should start</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">over so actually I went I went to</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">college and so you admit you went to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">college I went to yeah I did and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">wanted to actually study French</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:08.490" style="s2">literature and international relations</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.469" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">okay and my freshman year</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.490" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">I took the standard courses and I really</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:21.900" style="s2">delved into 20th century French</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:24.600" style="s2">literature and this was Duke this was</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.900" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">that tough so tough so okay so at Tufts</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.600" end="00:02:32.340" style="s2">I took all these kind of liberal arts</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:34.710" style="s2">classes humanities classes and I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.340" end="00:02:37.560" style="s2">actually disappointed I had all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.710" end="00:02:40.380" style="s2">ideas about like what what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.560" end="00:02:43.380" style="s2">accomplish in literature and what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.380" end="00:02:45.990" style="s2">would learn and I would ultimately find</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.380" end="00:02:47.730" style="s2">some sort of meaning you know some</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.990" end="00:02:51.420" style="s2">understanding of the world we live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.730" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">and instead I was frustrated and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.420" end="00:02:59.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem to be able to get answers to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">the questions I had and to my surprise I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.160" end="00:03:07.500" style="s2">was enjoying calculus much more than any</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:10.650" style="s2">other classes I took dears so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.500" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">happened was that but in my sophomore</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.650" end="00:03:16.140" style="s2">year I uh declared my math major okay so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.370" end="00:03:20.310" style="s2">you came out of the closet came out</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.140" end="00:03:26.780" style="s2">closet yeah yourself as a proto</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.310" end="00:03:32.280" style="s2">mathematician yes and then and then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.780" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">well of course I I grew up in a artistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.280" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">household and I I was thought I would I</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:45.410" style="s2">would do some sort of art work but once</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:45.410" style="s2">I discovered mathematics I found that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.500" end="00:03:53.430" style="s2">that it was is more artistic than any a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.510" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">thing that I&#39;d ever seen before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">more creative is more ingenious is more</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:05.610" style="s2">abstract just no author no no author</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s just it&#39;s just there and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.610" end="00:04:14.430" style="s2">it&#39;s and you could you could study it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">and it was infinitely deep you could you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.430" end="00:04:18.040" style="s2">could pick up any part and you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:19.660" style="s2">just keep going</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.040" end="00:04:23.380" style="s2">and everything just fit together so</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:26.860" style="s2">nicely I just wanted to see more and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.380" end="00:04:29.220" style="s2">understand more and you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.860" end="00:04:33.910" style="s2">other mathematical writing that were</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.220" end="00:04:36.790" style="s2">that was on the the blackboards like</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.910" end="00:04:39.220" style="s2">from the graduate classes and things</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.790" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">like that I wanted to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.220" end="00:04:43.480" style="s2">they were about and they must be</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:46.480" style="s2">representatives of some sort of world</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.480" end="00:04:49.000" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t have access to at the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.480" end="00:04:50.230" style="s2">so I&#39;m looking into your eyes I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.000" end="00:04:52.060" style="s2">something that looks like a religious</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.230" end="00:04:54.340" style="s2">convert or maybe like Ray Charles the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.060" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">first time he tried heroin or something</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.340" end="00:04:59.320" style="s2">you got the bug</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">absolutely okay yeah absolutely I uh I</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.320" end="00:05:03.070" style="s2">mean it&#39;s the only thing I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:07.210" style="s2">for about six years</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.070" end="00:05:10.350" style="s2">I just you&#39;re obsessed I I just dived</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.210" end="00:05:13.450" style="s2">into in fact I I don&#39;t think I had like</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.350" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">like kind of this really strong</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.450" end="00:05:18.940" style="s2">mathematical ability I was just</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:20.920" style="s2">fascinated by it and and for me it</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.940" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t come as naturally as it did for</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.920" end="00:05:31.780" style="s2">my brother and I really had to struggle</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:35.350" style="s2">I really had to I felt it was it was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.780" end="00:05:37.900" style="s2">real challenge to my self-worth I felt</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.350" end="00:05:41.010" style="s2">like if I couldn&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.900" end="00:05:44.380" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t understand mathematics that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.010" end="00:05:47.830" style="s2">that life was just not worth living whoa</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.380" end="00:05:50.170" style="s2">it was pretty it was like that I just</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.830" end="00:05:53.830" style="s2">decided I would prove to myself that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.170" end="00:05:56.020" style="s2">could do it and to the exclusion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.830" end="00:05:57.610" style="s2">almost everything else this is this is I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.020" end="00:05:59.860" style="s2">mean I&#39;m joking around a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.610" end="00:06:01.330" style="s2">about heroin but it does behave like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.860" end="00:06:03.700" style="s2">that once you find out that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.330" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">hidden world and that the this hidden</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.700" end="00:06:06.970" style="s2">world is strangely meaningful and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:08.980" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly too beautiful to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.970" end="00:06:11.830" style="s2">constructed by any human mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.980" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">mhm like the most beautiful human minds</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.830" end="00:06:15.640" style="s2">can barely understand this world but</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:18.040" style="s2">it&#39;s more like they&#39;re dusting off I</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.640" end="00:06:21.490" style="s2">guess in my understanding I think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.040" end="00:06:23.320" style="s2">like the ruins of Petra and imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.490" end="00:06:25.180" style="s2">Petra were buried in sand and you were</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.320" end="00:06:27.970" style="s2">just whisking away sand and uncovering</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.180" end="00:06:29.890" style="s2">ruins you&#39;d be pretty convinced that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.970" end="00:06:31.630" style="s2">weren&#39;t authoring</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.890" end="00:06:34.060" style="s2">the ruins of Petra you would know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.630" end="00:06:35.740" style="s2">you didn&#39;t build this thing but you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.060" end="00:06:38.050" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just such a privilege to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.740" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">be able to touch something this</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.050" end="00:06:48.640" style="s2">beautiful that&#39;s apparently unauthentic</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:52.470" style="s2">aynd of my feeling I feel like of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.640" end="00:06:56.380" style="s2">reverence and transcendence yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.470" end="00:06:59.860" style="s2">like there&#39;s this kind of eternal</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.380" end="00:07:02.650" style="s2">stillness in this world mmm you know you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:08.320" style="s2">and recently I&#39;ve just picked up feet by</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.650" end="00:07:10.540" style="s2">old math texts and the idea is there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.320" end="00:07:12.010" style="s2">just as fresh as they were you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.540" end="00:07:15.670" style="s2">thirty years ago when I was studying</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.010" end="00:07:17.190" style="s2">them and they still have that pure</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.670" end="00:07:20.050" style="s2">beauty about them</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.190" end="00:07:24.820" style="s2">look let me let you in a little bit on</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.050" end="00:07:26.770" style="s2">why I&#39;m having you on this program it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.820" end="00:07:31.210" style="s2">not just because I&#39;m so devoted to your</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.770" end="00:07:33.340" style="s2">work it&#39;s also because my belief is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.210" end="00:07:38.200" style="s2">we have the most beautiful symphonies in</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.340" end="00:07:42.970" style="s2">the world locked inside of our journals</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.200" end="00:07:47.080" style="s2">and our math libraries let&#39;s say as text</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.970" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">and you know you can ask well if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.080" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">have a symphony of Brahms is it a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:55.780" style="s2">symphony if it only resides in the sheet</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:57.340" style="s2">music and is never performed that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.780" end="00:07:59.550" style="s2">very disturbing question because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.340" end="00:08:02.260" style="s2">instructions for its performance are</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.550" end="00:08:04.420" style="s2">present and it may be that a tiny number</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.260" end="00:08:06.760" style="s2">of people can actually read a sheet of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.420" end="00:08:08.350" style="s2">sheet music and say oh my god that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.760" end="00:08:10.990" style="s2">gorgeous because they can hear it in</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.350" end="00:08:13.030" style="s2">their head but the rest of us actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.990" end="00:08:16.570" style="s2">need the thing to be performed and yet</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.030" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">there is no orchestra or analog of an</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.570" end="00:08:23.110" style="s2">orchestra that performs works of great</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.500" end="00:08:29.220" style="s2">mathematical or physical beauty yep</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.110" end="00:08:32.849" style="s2">that&#39;s true I mean part of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.220" end="00:08:35.430" style="s2">interest in mathematics initially was</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.849" end="00:08:38.370" style="s2">that I could take mathematics and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.430" end="00:08:40.919" style="s2">beautiful images that I saw in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.370" end="00:08:43.710" style="s2">yeah during math class and bring them</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.919" end="00:08:45.510" style="s2">out as artistic things well so this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.710" end="00:08:48.300" style="s2">where I start to also get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.510" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">pissed off with you which is no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.300" end="00:08:55.380" style="s2">kidding yeah I&#39;m angry about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:56.730" style="s2">that we have these papers and books that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.380" end="00:08:59.160" style="s2">form the sheet music that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.730" end="00:09:02.430" style="s2">performed and then I find out that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.160" end="00:09:05.550" style="s2">exist and that you have been performing</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.430" end="00:09:08.850" style="s2">and recording effectively these master</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.550" end="00:09:11.880" style="s2">works and then what do you do with like</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.850" end="00:09:17.250" style="s2">the vinyl you put it under bubble wrap</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.880" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">in some loft in Soho in Manhattan and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.250" end="00:09:22.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come out for years or decades at</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:25.770" style="s2">a time so effectively you&#39;re sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.260" end="00:09:28.490" style="s2">some of the only known recordings if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.770" end="00:09:31.700" style="s2">will of some of the great master works</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.490" end="00:09:35.640" style="s2">of the mathematical universe</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.700" end="00:09:41.190" style="s2">WTF what are you doing man</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.640" end="00:09:44.610" style="s2">I well I think I think with less what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.190" end="00:09:48.680" style="s2">happened is that I&#39;m always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.610" end="00:09:54.620" style="s2">interested in the next idea or the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.680" end="00:09:57.800" style="s2">the next theorem or the next project and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.620" end="00:10:00.450" style="s2">all these things that are made by me</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:04.680" style="s2">just sort of you know after I&#39;m done</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.450" end="00:10:06.360" style="s2">with it it&#39;s not doesn&#39;t seem that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.680" end="00:10:09.030" style="s2">important anymore what I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.360" end="00:10:11.310" style="s2">great in the artist but whoever&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.030" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">your PR and marketing I&#39;m firing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.310" end="00:10:19.020" style="s2">taking over so like here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">that I get as somebody who studied</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.020" end="00:10:23.100" style="s2">mathematics I had the same feeling I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:25.730" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily made to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.100" end="00:10:28.530" style="s2">mathematics that wasn&#39;t how my brain I</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.730" end="00:10:31.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t find the symbolic layer very easy</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.530" end="00:10:34.950" style="s2">but I I was exposed to things of such</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.860" end="00:10:36.990" style="s2">beauty and depth that I couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.950" end="00:10:39.240" style="s2">any other analog on planet earth once</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.990" end="00:10:40.860" style="s2">you understand how rich the mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.240" end="00:10:43.530" style="s2">universe actually is</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.860" end="00:10:45.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t believe that it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.530" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">somehow just created out of logical</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.960" end="00:10:53.030" style="s2">necessity and there&#39;s a tiny portion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:57.810" style="s2">it that is actually visualizable by our</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.030" end="00:10:59.550" style="s2">visual cortex and what&#39;s odd is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.810" end="00:11:01.590" style="s2">when we talk about things as being</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.550" end="00:11:02.760" style="s2">visual in mathematics we&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.590" end="00:11:05.880" style="s2">talking about things that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.760" end="00:11:08.250" style="s2">actually see we have an intuition that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.880" end="00:11:11.700" style="s2">comes from one two and three dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.250" end="00:11:13.320" style="s2">and then we have to take that intuition</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.700" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">where we can actually visualize</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.320" end="00:11:18.420" style="s2">something we can construct a model of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:23.490" style="s2">and we have a series of tricks by which</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.420" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">we use our minds to visualize things</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.490" end="00:11:28.200" style="s2">that we can&#39;t actually see I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:29.580" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what to call this</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.200" end="00:11:35.150" style="s2">process I&#39;m not sure if it has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.580" end="00:11:37.380" style="s2">description yeah I know you mean it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.150" end="00:11:42.120" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely an intuition that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.380" end="00:11:45.690" style="s2">have and it&#39;s some kind of vague mental</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.120" end="00:11:48.270" style="s2">image and I what I have to do is I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.690" end="00:11:52.740" style="s2">to somehow in my art work I have to take</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.270" end="00:11:55.490" style="s2">this vague mental image and try to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.740" end="00:11:58.980" style="s2">it concrete and it&#39;s it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.490" end="00:12:00.210" style="s2">well this is the thing I now keep in</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.980" end="00:12:02.310" style="s2">mind there are gonna be people who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.210" end="00:12:05.340" style="s2">listening to this as audio and then we</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.310" end="00:12:06.330" style="s2">will later release it as video and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.340" end="00:12:10.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know how much of it will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.330" end="00:12:11.550" style="s2">seeable on the channel but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.260" end="00:12:13.110" style="s2">things that&#39;s very interesting to me is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.550" end="00:12:15.300" style="s2">that what happens in our minds when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.110" end="00:12:17.010" style="s2">really start to open the portal to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.300" end="00:12:20.310" style="s2">deepest secrets that the universe has to</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.010" end="00:12:22.950" style="s2">offer is that we use this mixture and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.310" end="00:12:25.020" style="s2">the mixture is some amount of the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.950" end="00:12:27.180" style="s2">that we can construct as models so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.020" end="00:12:29.760" style="s2">we can actually directly visualize it as</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.180" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">if we could use our eyes to make a claim</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.760" end="00:12:35.130" style="s2">model of let&#39;s say an algebraic variety</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:37.320" style="s2">we&#39;re having and then there&#39;s this extra</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.130" end="00:12:40.230" style="s2">intuition that we have to build in from</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.320" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">texts and from symbology to remind</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.230" end="00:12:44.640" style="s2">ourselves that usually we&#39;re not able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:47.010" style="s2">see the full totality of whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.640" end="00:12:50.220" style="s2">we&#39;re discussing and your art very often</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.010" end="00:12:53.550" style="s2">has a geometric picture together with</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.220" end="00:12:54.450" style="s2">prose that is kind of fading in and out</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.550" end="00:12:56.940" style="s2">of perceptive</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.450" end="00:12:59.460" style="s2">together with a bunch of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.940" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">symbols that are describing what what</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.460" end="00:13:03.540" style="s2">has been constructed and I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.860" end="00:13:06.090" style="s2">what&#39;s very interesting is that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.540" end="00:13:09.290" style="s2">actually mirrors what a mathematicians</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.090" end="00:13:11.780" style="s2">model is of one of these higher</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.290" end="00:13:14.910" style="s2">structures that can&#39;t be seen directly</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.780" end="00:13:17.420" style="s2">but it&#39;s basically intuition from a low</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.910" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">dimensional thing that can be visualized</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.420" end="00:13:23.070" style="s2">together with prose and mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">symbols that actually rigorously</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.070" end="00:13:30.660" style="s2">describe the object and so that in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.680" end="00:13:33.870" style="s2">sense it is a faithful recreation by</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.660" end="00:13:37.620" style="s2">combining you know gorgeous form</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.620" end="00:13:43.860" style="s2">symbology in order to recreate the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.130" end="00:13:45.840" style="s2">mathematical state that we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.860" end="00:13:49.530" style="s2">saying well that&#39;s very that mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.840" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">is very visual so for example behind you</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.530" end="00:13:54.350" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:57.330" style="s2">there&#39;s an amazing painting that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.350" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">seen for years I think I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.330" end="00:14:05.190" style="s2">used in a talk at Columbia as the cover</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:07.170" style="s2">art for the first slide of what I assume</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.190" end="00:14:09.510" style="s2">is Heinz Hoffs</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.170" end="00:14:13.700" style="s2">famous vibration from the early 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.510" end="00:14:18.930" style="s2">and so it&#39;s the series of interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.700" end="00:14:24.860" style="s2">partial tour I each of which is filled</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.930" end="00:14:28.770" style="s2">up by circles and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.860" end="00:14:32.970" style="s2">impressionistic but also somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.770" end="00:14:35.670" style="s2">rigorous description of this object that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.970" end="00:14:38.220" style="s2">on the Joe Rogan program I said maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.670" end="00:14:41.810" style="s2">the most important object in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.220" end="00:14:44.760" style="s2">universe because when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.810" end="00:14:46.740" style="s2">physics being ultimately a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.760" end="00:14:49.260" style="s2">waves we want to know well what are</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.740" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">those waves waves in what is the analog</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.260" end="00:14:55.710" style="s2">of the ocean for an ocean wave inside of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:58.650" style="s2">physics so those waves are waves in</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.710" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">bundles and the bundles come in two</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.650" end="00:15:03.810" style="s2">basic types for most most purposes one</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:06.300" style="s2">is called a principal bundle which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.810" end="00:15:08.019" style="s2">what you have behind you and you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.300" end="00:15:09.999" style="s2">so good as to put</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.019" end="00:15:11.709" style="s2">action of another kind of bundle which</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.999" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">is sort of even closer to the wave</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.709" end="00:15:16.899" style="s2">concept a vector bundle which is what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:19.149" style="s2">behind me now I think it&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.899" end="00:15:21.819" style="s2">that we have all of these programs let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.499" end="00:15:27.299" style="s2">universe and all all of these things and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:29.619" style="s2">yet when I ask people well do you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.299" end="00:15:31.509" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in wave particle</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.619" end="00:15:33.489" style="s2">duality do you know what the waves are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.509" end="00:15:36.519" style="s2">waves in nobody seems to know about</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.489" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">bundles it&#39;s surprising</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.519" end="00:15:41.549" style="s2">well it&#39;s disturbing and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.279" end="00:15:42.699" style="s2">that there are very few people depicting</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.549" end="00:15:47.949" style="s2">bundles</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.699" end="00:15:51.069" style="s2">artistically and essentially the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.949" end="00:15:53.019" style="s2">person doing it is hiding their artwork</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.069" end="00:15:58.989" style="s2">away so that nobody even knows it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.019" end="00:16:00.879" style="s2">there J&#39;Accuse well no I mean that like</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.989" end="00:16:02.410" style="s2">this this is an important link I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.879" end="00:16:06.970" style="s2">is what I&#39;m trying to say is is that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.410" end="00:16:09.459" style="s2">are somehow breaking the secrecy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.970" end="00:16:11.589" style="s2">like you know Prometheus gave fire to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.459" end="00:16:15.850" style="s2">man okay well you are now bringing</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.589" end="00:16:20.439" style="s2">bundles to the masses and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.850" end="00:16:22.809" style="s2">it&#39;s fantastic because it allows people</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.439" end="00:16:26.259" style="s2">to skip the symbolic step which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.809" end="00:16:30.069" style="s2">usually what what leaves them out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.259" end="00:16:36.179" style="s2">participating at least as observers of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.069" end="00:16:38.379" style="s2">the amazing Museum of mathematical finds</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.179" end="00:16:41.230" style="s2">can you talk a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.379" end="00:16:43.059" style="s2">caused you to do these two works the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.230" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">principal bundle behind you which what</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.059" end="00:16:48.129" style="s2">do we call this hopf fibration yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:51.220" style="s2">yeah called the hopf fibration and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.129" end="00:16:53.230" style="s2">behind me and I called it purple vector</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.220" end="00:16:54.999" style="s2">bundle purple vector bundle all right so</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.230" end="00:16:56.799" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a principal bundle which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.999" end="00:16:58.600" style="s2">the hopf fibration purple vector bundle</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.799" end="00:17:01.809" style="s2">talk to me about what you were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.600" end="00:17:05.649" style="s2">when you created them well like so I had</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.809" end="00:17:08.230" style="s2">the fortune in undergrad to be the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.649" end="00:17:09.939" style="s2">advisee of an entrepreneur she was an</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.230" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">assistant professor at the time her name</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.939" end="00:17:13.179" style="s2">is Monserrat</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:15.370" style="s2">ticky door and she&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.179" end="00:17:19.559" style="s2">known in not to break geometry</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.370" end="00:17:24.819" style="s2">and she had this kind of deep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.559" end="00:17:27.970" style="s2">quiet confidence about her and I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.819" end="00:17:29.680" style="s2">go to office hours religiously and I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.970" end="00:17:32.440" style="s2">sit there and annoy her with my</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.680" end="00:17:36.040" style="s2">questions from undergrad math but she</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.440" end="00:17:38.380" style="s2">was always working with with a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.040" end="00:17:40.750" style="s2">pencil sharpened all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.380" end="00:17:44.470" style="s2">eraser almost and she would be always</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.750" end="00:17:48.040" style="s2">writing the word that let F being a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.470" end="00:17:50.410" style="s2">fiber bundle and so I was a freshman and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.040" end="00:17:53.590" style="s2">I was thinking to myself what the heck</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.410" end="00:17:57.309" style="s2">is a fiber bundle no one&#39;s ever told me</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.590" end="00:18:00.640" style="s2">about that and so my kind of one one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.309" end="00:18:03.070" style="s2">the goals in studying math was to figure</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:05.050" style="s2">out just what it was that she was</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.070" end="00:18:07.809" style="s2">thinking about he&#39;s what were these</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.050" end="00:18:11.290" style="s2">fiber bundles that she was constantly</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.809" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">writing about and so in my mind I always</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.290" end="00:18:15.010" style="s2">had this idea that I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:17.500" style="s2">understand that and so that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.010" end="00:18:20.200" style="s2">probably the the germ of my interest in</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.500" end="00:18:22.690" style="s2">bundles and then later on in grad school</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.200" end="00:18:26.250" style="s2">I like you know encountered them and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.690" end="00:18:29.110" style="s2">then later on when I started painting I</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.250" end="00:18:31.750" style="s2">just I don&#39;t know me we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.110" end="00:18:35.470" style="s2">about intuition earlier and and I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.750" end="00:18:37.960" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s some sort of sieve in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.470" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">us when we see lots of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.960" end="00:18:42.550" style="s2">things or anything in a world in for</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:45.429" style="s2">that matter there&#39;s something that tells</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.550" end="00:18:48.100" style="s2">us well this there&#39;s some content here</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.429" end="00:18:52.510" style="s2">and that this is worthy of our attention</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.100" end="00:18:54.610" style="s2">and somehow these bundles vector bundles</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.510" end="00:18:57.400" style="s2">fiber bundles principal fiber bundles</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.610" end="00:19:00.940" style="s2">were just objects that to me were worthy</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.400" end="00:19:04.900" style="s2">of sinking a lot of time and thought and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.940" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">making artwork of so I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.900" end="00:19:10.420" style="s2">what it was that drew me to them except</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.220" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">sort of like the XY plane growing up and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.429" end="00:20:07.290" style="s2">going off to graduate school yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:10.770" style="s2">the analog of the x-axis would be called</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:18.059" style="s2">would be called the fibers and the XY</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:22.920" style="s2">plane would be called the total space</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.059" end="00:20:25.850" style="s2">and in that story the x-axis gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.920" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">replaced by space-time and the y-axis</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.850" end="00:20:33.179" style="s2">gets replaced by various things like a</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.879" end="00:23:21.799" style="s2">they&#39;re all nested now the odd thing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.519" end="00:23:23.419" style="s2">is that before I knew about your work I</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.799" end="00:23:25.129" style="s2">think and before I knew about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.419" end="00:23:27.019" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve been kind of drawer Barna</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.129" end="00:23:29.990" style="s2">ton who came up with a picture of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.019" end="00:23:32.179" style="s2">which he termed planet hop which I used</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.990" end="00:23:38.539" style="s2">yeah yeah I think you pointed me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.179" end="00:23:41.749" style="s2">now I did a version of this in a Python</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.539" end="00:23:44.659" style="s2">release by a group called n thought and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.749" end="00:23:47.929" style="s2">I got them to help me out I had to use</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.659" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">the transparency of some of the visual</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.929" end="00:23:52.100" style="s2">structures to allow me to see through so</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:53.730" style="s2">I didn&#39;t have the occlusion phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.100" end="00:23:57.810" style="s2">you don&#39;t have that luxury with pain</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.730" end="00:24:00.090" style="s2">right it is very tough to see but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.810" end="00:24:01.790" style="s2">fact that it can be seen and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.090" end="00:24:05.490" style="s2">this is the really interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.790" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">means that a giant chunk of physics and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.490" end="00:24:12.870" style="s2">mathematics is almost within reach of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:14.940" style="s2">the person who can&#39;t trust her or his</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.870" end="00:24:18.420" style="s2">ability to negotiate the world of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.940" end="00:24:20.520" style="s2">mathematical symbols and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.420" end="00:24:22.590" style="s2">is a huge problem and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.520" end="00:24:25.530" style="s2">think that they&#39;re bad at music in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.590" end="00:24:28.820" style="s2">West because our music is so dependent</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.530" end="00:24:31.200" style="s2">on notation however in lots of cultures</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.820" end="00:24:33.300" style="s2">notation isn&#39;t what carries music it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.200" end="00:24:34.800" style="s2">just personal instruction and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.300" end="00:24:36.930" style="s2">those people who are bad at symbols</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.800" end="00:24:39.320" style="s2">would be good at music if it were in any</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.930" end="00:24:42.840" style="s2">other culture that wasn&#39;t symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.320" end="00:24:45.090" style="s2">so dependent and I view this as being</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.840" end="00:24:47.730" style="s2">well what if I was in a culture in which</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.090" end="00:24:52.470" style="s2">mathematics wasn&#39;t transmitted as much</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.730" end="00:24:54.470" style="s2">symbolically fair unfair it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.470" end="00:24:59.250" style="s2">interesting approach</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.470" end="00:25:01.290" style="s2">I&#39;m not wholly sure but yeah I can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.250" end="00:25:03.390" style="s2">I can buy that because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.290" end="00:25:06.090" style="s2">that that drew me to math was the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.390" end="00:25:08.580" style="s2">actually actuated symbols actually Wow I</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.090" end="00:25:11.910" style="s2">want to talk about this mathematical art</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.580" end="00:25:13.800" style="s2">movement that has never been named okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.910" end="00:25:18.560" style="s2">right now I&#39;m gonna try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.800" end="00:25:20.610" style="s2">what name to give it later but mmm like</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.560" end="00:25:23.400" style="s2">tell me if any of the following of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.610" end="00:25:27.330" style="s2">impact did you John Archibald wheeler</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.400" end="00:25:31.470" style="s2">who was fineman&#39;s teacher yep</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.330" end="00:25:33.990" style="s2">very famous physicist he seemed to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.470" end="00:25:35.880" style="s2">an incredible passion for doing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.990" end="00:25:38.760" style="s2">kinds of things you&#39;re doing on</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:40.350" style="s2">blackboards to give these masterful</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.760" end="00:25:43.770" style="s2">lectures have you ever encountered his</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.350" end="00:25:46.350" style="s2">blackboards now I have it okay let me</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.770" end="00:25:47.970" style="s2">try another one Roger Penrose who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.350" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">the road to reality is of course a</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.970" end="00:25:54.420" style="s2">relatively famous person drew the first</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:57.390" style="s2">copy of the hopf fibration that I&#39;d ever</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.420" end="00:26:00.900" style="s2">seen strikingly like your own have you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.390" end="00:26:03.480" style="s2">seen that I have I have that book yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.900" end="00:26:06.550" style="s2">it&#39;s reality and I have some some of his</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.480" end="00:26:08.410" style="s2">more recent books as well but</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.550" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">I think the first picture of hot version</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.410" end="00:26:14.230" style="s2">I ever saw was Bill Thurston&#39;s in his</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:15.490" style="s2">three dimensional geometry topology</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.230" end="00:26:17.590" style="s2">oh the are these were these the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.490" end="00:26:19.270" style="s2">Princeton lecture notes that were</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.590" end="00:26:20.800" style="s2">released as a book or do they hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.270" end="00:26:22.540" style="s2">become a bit eventually peaking book</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.800" end="00:26:25.150" style="s2">okay yeah this is the things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.540" end="00:26:27.430" style="s2">mathematicians would trade these yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.150" end="00:26:29.770" style="s2">heard mimeograph notes that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.430" end="00:26:31.240" style="s2">quite books but we would all look at</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.770" end="00:26:33.940" style="s2">them and we felt like we were looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.240" end="00:26:36.100" style="s2">into secret tomes that only some people</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.940" end="00:26:37.510" style="s2">could have that&#39;s right I think later it</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.100" end="00:26:38.260" style="s2">became a book and that&#39;s when I went in</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.510" end="00:26:41.920" style="s2">for science</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:44.650" style="s2">so bill Thurston of course was famous</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.920" end="00:26:48.010" style="s2">within mathematics as being a Fields</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.650" end="00:26:50.770" style="s2">medalist who contributed to Grisha</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.010" end="00:26:52.980" style="s2">Perlman&#39;s program for solving the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.770" end="00:26:56.200" style="s2">Pangkor a conjecture in dimension 3</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.200" end="00:27:00.790" style="s2">sufficiently simple from its algebraic</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.300" end="00:27:03.030" style="s2">properties had to actually be the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.790" end="00:27:05.320" style="s2">three-dimensional version of the sphere</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.030" end="00:27:10.600" style="s2">did you know Bill Thurston at all I</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.320" end="00:27:13.510" style="s2">didn&#39;t I knew people who yeah I knew a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.600" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">little bit he came through Harvard when</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.510" end="00:27:17.800" style="s2">I was a graduate student there and one</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:19.090" style="s2">of it one of the odd comments he made he</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.800" end="00:27:21.640" style="s2">said you want to know what keeps this</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.090" end="00:27:25.000" style="s2">field great and I said tell me he said</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.640" end="00:27:26.140" style="s2">in any other field if a fields medalist</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.000" end="00:27:28.390" style="s2">came through that was that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.140" end="00:27:30.790" style="s2">Nobel Prize winner at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.390" end="00:27:32.470" style="s2">field it would be a big deal and he said</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.790" end="00:27:35.700" style="s2">Here I am sitting with a bunch of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.470" end="00:27:38.560" style="s2">guys at some salad bar after my talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.700" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">because we&#39;re just not that pretentious</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.560" end="00:27:42.490" style="s2">and I thought that&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:45.160" style="s2">he recognized that he would be a big</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.490" end="00:27:48.070" style="s2">shot and he really valued the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.160" end="00:27:50.740" style="s2">nothing was being made over his presence</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.070" end="00:27:55.950" style="s2">beyond the mathematics that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.740" end="00:28:00.660" style="s2">yeah in fact I was reading his book on</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.950" end="00:28:06.520" style="s2">my honeymoon I brought it along Hinda</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.660" end="00:28:09.060" style="s2">yeah we were just we were in Honolulu</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.520" end="00:28:12.130" style="s2">and we had this nice place and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.060" end="00:28:15.190" style="s2">beautiful lanai and here I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.130" end="00:28:18.460" style="s2">reading Thurston&#39;s and that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.190" end="00:28:24.460" style="s2">thought well you had but beauty for yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.460" end="00:28:25.960" style="s2">I was what is it that you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.460" end="00:28:28.419" style="s2">supposed to be doing I mean you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.960" end="00:28:30.610" style="s2">this ability to understand mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.419" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">and you have the ability to look into</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.610" end="00:28:35.020" style="s2">your own mind and see well how is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:36.850" style="s2">registering and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.020" end="00:28:41.530" style="s2">ability to externalize it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.850" end="00:28:44.289" style="s2">relatively unusual skill set I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.530" end="00:28:47.020" style="s2">there&#39;s I shouldn&#39;t continue mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.289" end="00:28:50.980" style="s2">the remaining names like Fomenko is this</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.020" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">crazy mathematical artist I like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.980" end="00:28:58.120" style="s2">fact that Beth Shiba Grossman is doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:02.700" style="s2">some beautiful mathematical sculpture</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.120" end="00:29:05.950" style="s2">guy named Nico Myers in I guess Temecula</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.700" end="00:29:08.110" style="s2">is doing hopf fibration sculpture right</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.950" end="00:29:10.270" style="s2">now Wow okay yeah well in part because</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.110" end="00:29:11.950" style="s2">you know we&#39;re now talking about this on</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.270" end="00:29:15.190" style="s2">these large programs and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.950" end="00:29:17.049" style="s2">people just turning off and saying well</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.190" end="00:29:18.610" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what that was because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.049" end="00:29:20.380" style="s2">visual people are getting super</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.610" end="00:29:21.700" style="s2">intrigued and just going on and trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.380" end="00:29:24.549" style="s2">to learn the math for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.700" end="00:29:26.860" style="s2">including artists right so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.549" end="00:29:28.809" style="s2">what there needs to be is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.860" end="00:29:31.750" style="s2">movement I mentioned an artist named</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.809" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">Luke Jerram who did these beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.750" end="00:29:41.799" style="s2">glass sculpture of pathogens and viruses</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:43.270" style="s2">and like Milton he does malaria and HIV</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.799" end="00:29:48.850" style="s2">and it&#39;s just absolutely stunningly</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.270" end="00:29:50.470" style="s2">beautiful who are be obviously in MC</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.850" end="00:29:52.809" style="s2">Escher is probably the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.470" end="00:29:56.350" style="s2">mathematical artist of them all and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.809" end="00:29:58.330" style="s2">right why aren&#39;t there more people</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.350" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">working in this movement why isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.330" end="00:30:01.690" style="s2">movement name why aren&#39;t you guys</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:05.220" style="s2">collected why aren&#39;t there exhibitions</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.690" end="00:30:05.220" style="s2">of this stuff why why why why why</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:15.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know um it could be that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.330" end="00:30:18.379" style="s2">it could be that the people who feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.460" end="00:30:24.869" style="s2">that they can actually do this</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.379" end="00:30:26.429" style="s2">don&#39;t really have and maybe it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.869" end="00:30:29.099" style="s2">the mathematics is too attractive to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.429" end="00:30:32.009" style="s2">them you know it&#39;s like you&#39;d rather do</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.099" end="00:30:36.749" style="s2">math and then make paintings about math</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.009" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">or make representations of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.749" end="00:30:41.700" style="s2">it&#39;s so much more beautiful to spend</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:44.009" style="s2">your time like the analogy I have is of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.700" end="00:30:46.529" style="s2">a mountaineer you know you&#39;d rather be</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.009" end="00:30:48.359" style="s2">out climbing your mountains than have</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.529" end="00:30:53.759" style="s2">been all right you know I remember you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.359" end="00:30:55.589" style="s2">okay tell me you don&#39;t feel cut off from</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.759" end="00:30:57.539" style="s2">people who you can&#39;t show this to like</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.589" end="00:31:00.059" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone someplace on them on a trek</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.539" end="00:31:02.099" style="s2">as a Mountaineer which is so</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.059" end="00:31:04.739" style="s2">spectacularly gorgeous you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.099" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">believe that it exists yeah and you if</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.239" end="00:31:13.979" style="s2">to figure out well can I charter a</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.950" end="00:31:15.929" style="s2">helicopter can I get this person to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.979" end="00:31:18.389" style="s2">into really good physical shape and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.929" end="00:31:19.889" style="s2">make the long trek is there any way I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.389" end="00:31:21.989" style="s2">can bring back a picture that can</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.889" end="00:31:22.990" style="s2">communicate it I guess I feel cut off</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.230" end="00:31:48.850" style="s2">to not to mention the math behind my</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.830" end="00:31:50.020" style="s2">work I told you that I mean general</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.850" end="00:31:54.460" style="s2">people just say oh they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.020" end="00:31:55.660" style="s2">interested in the math they&#39;re not all</p>

<p begin="00:31:55.660" end="00:32:02.500" style="s2">mention it but I&#39;m certainly it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:05.170" style="s2">think people when they see something</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.500" end="00:32:08.740" style="s2">that there is mathematics behind it I</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.170" end="00:32:10.660" style="s2">think it scares them off yeah and most</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.740" end="00:32:15.520" style="s2">people have bad memories of their</p>

<p begin="00:32:15.520" end="00:32:20.890" style="s2">that they they have this reflex to just</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.580" end="00:32:23.680" style="s2">turn away from it well it&#39;s like the bad</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.930" end="00:32:43.990" style="s2">physicians to patients and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.990" end="00:32:48.550" style="s2">talk about math a genic harm where there</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.990" end="00:32:52.330" style="s2">is this like destruction of the love and</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.010" end="00:33:02.410" style="s2">somehow we&#39;re keeping the beauty for</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.590" end="00:33:04.330" style="s2">ourselves yeah and a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.410" end="00:33:07.330" style="s2">people have no idea they&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.330" end="00:33:09.220" style="s2">like I know they&#39;ve had their knuckles</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.580" end="00:33:22.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s some other percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.800" end="00:33:24.400" style="s2">people are gonna look at it and say I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.120" end="00:33:28.920" style="s2">got to figure out what that was about</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.400" end="00:33:28.920" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know that that was there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.120" end="00:33:36.779" style="s2">are you connect</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.039" end="00:33:39.299" style="s2">these people I mentioned um you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.779" end="00:33:41.369" style="s2">people that are not like Bathsheba</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.299" end="00:33:43.259" style="s2">Grossman oh no I&#39;m not I&#39;m gonna stole</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.369" end="00:33:46.649" style="s2">no I know them I know how they are yeah</p>

<p begin="00:33:52.279" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">different sorry i yang supporter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.619" end="00:34:01.499" style="s2">yeah okay well so he&#39;s got these math</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:04.259" style="s2">hats I would look yeah that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.499" end="00:34:11.159" style="s2">coming yang yesterday I should get my my</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.159" end="00:34:18.089" style="s2">many to some extent this is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.690" end="00:34:19.919" style="s2">the first generation of mathematical or</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.089" end="00:34:22.649" style="s2">physical art in your family am i right</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:25.230" style="s2">that your father somehow was uh was</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.649" end="00:34:29.129" style="s2">mining this vein as well yeah so my</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.230" end="00:34:31.470" style="s2">father trained as an engineer and worked</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.129" end="00:34:33.480" style="s2">as a mechanical engineer for for ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.470" end="00:34:35.609" style="s2">years quite successfully in New York</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.480" end="00:34:38.309" style="s2">City and the whole time he wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.609" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">an artist and he was painting at the Art</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.309" end="00:34:44.730" style="s2">Students League and he made all these</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:46.919" style="s2">paintings figurative and an abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.730" end="00:34:51.480" style="s2">so on then he won a prize for painting</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.919" end="00:34:55.230" style="s2">and then the stipulation for the price</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.480" end="00:34:58.819" style="s2">was that he had to quit his engineering</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.230" end="00:35:01.710" style="s2">career and devote himself to art and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.819" end="00:35:05.609" style="s2">upon quitting he found he couldn&#39;t paint</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.710" end="00:35:07.020" style="s2">anymore Wow and he kind of did some</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.609" end="00:35:09.859" style="s2">soul-searching travelled around the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.020" end="00:35:13.650" style="s2">world and that&#39;s when he realized that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.859" end="00:35:16.109" style="s2">there was something that he could do</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.650" end="00:35:19.400" style="s2">with this engineering background somehow</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.109" end="00:35:20.970" style="s2">he could bring engineering and science</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.400" end="00:35:22.980" style="s2">into his artwork</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.970" end="00:35:27.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s when he started developing</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.980" end="00:35:29.250" style="s2">his cybernetic sculptures and and he</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.900" end="00:35:31.970" style="s2">never turned back</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.250" end="00:35:36.630" style="s2">you always made these kind of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.970" end="00:35:39.299" style="s2">engineering just saw them yeah first</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.630" end="00:35:40.020" style="s2">time you&#39;re at your studio yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.299" end="00:35:42.620" style="s2">gorgeous</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.020" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">mmm I mean I love your stuff I love</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.620" end="00:35:46.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that I was gonna love his</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:50.180" style="s2">yeah these gorgeous standing waves yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.910" end="00:35:53.900" style="s2">mmm and then by the use of clever use of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.180" end="00:35:57.110" style="s2">stroboscopic light he&#39;s able to freeze</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.900" end="00:36:00.340" style="s2">them and show this like very subtle</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.110" end="00:36:03.320" style="s2">motion that would otherwise be lost and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.340" end="00:36:05.720" style="s2">you know I think that the wave equation</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.320" end="00:36:08.300" style="s2">which is a you know a particular class</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.720" end="00:36:11.180" style="s2">of equations while known in mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.300" end="00:36:12.680" style="s2">is one of the most beautiful things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.180" end="00:36:15.950" style="s2">ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.680" end="00:36:19.310" style="s2">and to be able to visualize waves hmm is</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.950" end="00:36:21.170" style="s2">precious to me astounding that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.310" end="00:36:25.910" style="s2">aware of his work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.170" end="00:36:29.630" style="s2">um I think the lesson from my father he</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.910" end="00:36:32.740" style="s2">never thought of himself as as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.630" end="00:36:35.270" style="s2">scientist or as a technological artist</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.740" end="00:36:38.750" style="s2">he thought of himself just as an artist</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.270" end="00:36:41.980" style="s2">and I think what he was trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.750" end="00:36:46.040" style="s2">with that was that technology and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.980" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">science they&#39;re they&#39;re not really like</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.040" end="00:36:51.860" style="s2">tools or that you could just say oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:54.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a technological artist that these</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.860" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">are just things that as artists that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.740" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">part of our culture and part of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">society that we have a right to use them</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:09.830" style="s2">just as as much as in a professional</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:12.260" style="s2">scientists do and I think in that way I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.830" end="00:37:14.390" style="s2">think of myself as an artist</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.260" end="00:37:20.630" style="s2">not as a mathematic artist but as an</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.390" end="00:37:22.940" style="s2">artist and it turns out that having seen</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.630" end="00:37:23.690" style="s2">mathematics and having been exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.940" end="00:37:28.910" style="s2">mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.690" end="00:37:32.990" style="s2">it just it&#39;s just like part of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.910" end="00:37:35.780" style="s2">that I&#39;ve incorporated in myself and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.990" end="00:37:38.710" style="s2">artwork that I make has those features</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.780" end="00:37:44.540" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of my life experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.710" end="00:37:47.840" style="s2">so I&#39;m not sure that we you could we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.540" end="00:37:50.740" style="s2">term this movement as mathematical art</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.840" end="00:37:53.770" style="s2">but I think we&#39;re just artists who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.740" end="00:37:56.530" style="s2">kind of expanding our</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.770" end="00:38:00.070" style="s2">our understanding to those realms that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.530" end="00:38:03.010" style="s2">are difficult for for most people to</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.070" end="00:38:06.460" style="s2">reach and I think but that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.010" end="00:38:08.560" style="s2">what it means to be human you know like</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.460" end="00:38:11.530" style="s2">we don&#39;t call let me just just kill me</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.560" end="00:38:15.850" style="s2">in your point mmm we don&#39;t call salvador</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.530" end="00:38:18.540" style="s2">dali a mathematical artist and yet um</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.850" end="00:38:21.820" style="s2">you know if he puts Jesus on a</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.360" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">the hopf fibration exists and the these</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.820" end="00:40:16.830" style="s2">things are like angels we know that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:19.590" style="s2">they&#39;re there it&#39;s not speculative and</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:39.120" style="s2">mean that the art here to me is your</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.170" end="00:40:40.710" style="s2">decision to depict this in the way in</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.120" end="00:40:43.620" style="s2">which you chose to depict it but the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.710" end="00:40:48.840" style="s2">source that you&#39;re mining has nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.620" end="00:40:52.530" style="s2">do with our humanity I see yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.840" end="00:40:55.350" style="s2">yeah I mean like in essence the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.530" end="00:40:58.800" style="s2">that you have behind you right now is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.350" end="00:41:00.660" style="s2">me a modern picture of an angel where I</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.800" end="00:41:02.540" style="s2">can&#39;t believe in angels but I can</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.590" end="00:41:25.140" style="s2">mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:31.230" style="s2">maybe math is not it&#39;s not a product of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.140" end="00:41:35.670" style="s2">humanity but I feel that the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.230" end="00:41:38.700" style="s2">struggle to understand math and to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.670" end="00:41:42.090" style="s2">create these mathematical texts I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.700" end="00:41:45.270" style="s2">that in itself is awesome that has a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.090" end="00:41:47.100" style="s2">very human aspect to it and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.270" end="00:41:50.760" style="s2">of the properties I&#39;m trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.100" end="00:41:54.860" style="s2">in my art is just trying to express the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.760" end="00:41:58.170" style="s2">even maybe even though math is not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.860" end="00:42:01.230" style="s2">human thing it&#39;s a you somehow much</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.170" end="00:42:05.220" style="s2">deeper it&#39;s a universal thing but that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.230" end="00:42:08.520" style="s2">it&#39;s practice is human and that I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.220" end="00:42:09.750" style="s2">to show the humaneness by that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.520" end="00:42:12.540" style="s2">you&#39;re doing yeah me you&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.750" end="00:42:14.220" style="s2">cousin humanized an angel right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.540" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">I want to bring that out of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.220" end="00:42:21.960" style="s2">it&#39;s very important that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:25.950" style="s2">hand of the artist be present kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.960" end="00:42:28.410" style="s2">like expressing the difficulty that as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.950" end="00:42:31.560" style="s2">human being I have to try to unknown I</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.410" end="00:42:34.680" style="s2">see struggle that the you know I look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.560" end="00:42:37.530" style="s2">all of the text that&#39;s going in and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.680" end="00:42:41.580" style="s2">around the color or in the charcoal</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.530" end="00:42:43.260" style="s2">drawings and I struggle to read it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.580" end="00:42:46.020" style="s2">hard to read it because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.260" end="00:42:48.930" style="s2">presented to be read in Anna stip achill</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.020" end="00:42:52.020" style="s2">fashion and I love the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.930" end="00:42:55.050" style="s2">slightly irregular and it shows in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.020" end="00:42:58.920" style="s2">sense a perfect structure that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.050" end="00:43:01.830" style="s2">depicted perfectly right you know do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.920" end="00:43:04.260" style="s2">ever feel like freaked out being in</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.830" end="00:43:05.160" style="s2">direct touch with these otherworldly</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.260" end="00:43:13.950" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.160" end="00:43:16.230" style="s2">I feel inadequate yeah yeah that no</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.950" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">matter how much time I spend with them</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.230" end="00:43:23.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a community never quite grasped</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:27.450" style="s2">it in its totality it&#39;s somehow beyond</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.420" end="00:43:29.820" style="s2">my reach and of course you know then</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.450" end="00:43:32.220" style="s2">sometimes I blame oh well maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.820" end="00:43:33.960" style="s2">my ability I&#39;m just not I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.220" end="00:43:37.470" style="s2">have no I think we have to bear</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.960" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">away from how creepy it is that these</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.470" end="00:43:43.770" style="s2">things are even there to be found</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:45.480" style="s2">you know I typically give the example of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.770" end="00:43:47.820" style="s2">exceptional League groups or exotic</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.480" end="00:43:50.330" style="s2">seven spheres which are the structures</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.820" end="00:43:57.450" style="s2">people can look up if they if they dare</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.330" end="00:44:01.070" style="s2">as things that both make me feel not</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.450" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">alone and make me feel vaguely terrified</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.070" end="00:44:05.310" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like what if a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:07.859" style="s2">cigar-shaped object just started</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.310" end="00:44:11.580" style="s2">hovering over the earth and it didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.859" end="00:44:12.720" style="s2">anything like malignant but we knew it</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.580" end="00:44:14.990" style="s2">wasn&#39;t from us</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.720" end="00:44:18.300" style="s2">and we don&#39;t we didn&#39;t know what it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.990" end="00:44:21.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t show any signs of life other than</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.300" end="00:44:22.830" style="s2">the fact that it was there when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.180" end="00:44:26.369" style="s2">child I used to have dreams like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.830" end="00:44:27.960" style="s2">nightmares like that and this is long</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.369" end="00:44:30.290" style="s2">before I knew anything about math I</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.960" end="00:44:33.089" style="s2">would dream about these huge surfaces</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.290" end="00:44:37.650" style="s2">and I was so tiny like the size of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.089" end="00:44:39.930" style="s2">tent and they would be so smooth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.650" end="00:44:41.970" style="s2">like infinitely smooth even though I had</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.930" end="00:44:43.109" style="s2">no idea what infinity smooth meant but</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.970" end="00:44:46.910" style="s2">they were so smooth and they were</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.109" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">terrifying and maybe that&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.910" end="00:44:53.700" style="s2">my very first kind of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:56.700" style="s2">experience just just these things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.700" end="00:44:58.680" style="s2">appeared in my dreams now one of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.700" end="00:45:02.040" style="s2">weird things that we&#39;re doing on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.680" end="00:45:03.900" style="s2">podcast is we&#39;re picking on people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.040" end="00:45:07.020" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily know that we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.900" end="00:45:09.930" style="s2">and promoting what they do and we call</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.020" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">this reverse sponsorship and the hope is</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.930" end="00:45:16.050" style="s2">is that if we have a successful business</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:20.220" style="s2">and we can pick on it that as we</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.050" end="00:45:23.339" style="s2">generate interest in that business from</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.220" end="00:45:25.170" style="s2">our audience that maybe some of those</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.339" end="00:45:29.400" style="s2">businesses will come and sponsor the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.170" end="00:45:32.070" style="s2">portal and keep us on the air when we go</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.400" end="00:45:35.700" style="s2">into very difficult topics I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.070" end="00:45:37.230" style="s2">to ever ask that of you but I I would I</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.700" end="00:45:40.170" style="s2">do want to say that in some sense this</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.230" end="00:45:43.140" style="s2">episode is part of something akin to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.170" end="00:45:44.940" style="s2">reverse sponsorship I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.140" end="00:45:48.090" style="s2">biggest problem and you tell me if this</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.940" end="00:45:50.700" style="s2">rings true or not is that a lot of us</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.090" end="00:45:53.970" style="s2">work that never gets curated by a second</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.700" end="00:45:58.710" style="s2">person that in general I used to think</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.970" end="00:46:00.210" style="s2">curation was a parasitic behavior if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.710" end="00:46:02.790" style="s2">couldn&#39;t create you could point at</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.210" end="00:46:05.250" style="s2">things that were great and I later</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.790" end="00:46:07.560" style="s2">realized with my own stuff then until</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.250" end="00:46:10.530" style="s2">somebody else said hey this person is</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.560" end="00:46:13.080" style="s2">saying something that you don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.530" end="00:46:15.210" style="s2">get heard or processed because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.080" end="00:46:17.550" style="s2">actually curate yourself somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.210" end="00:46:20.130" style="s2">has to be the pointer and saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.550" end="00:46:23.130" style="s2">people pay attention and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.130" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">way past time that this be done for you</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.130" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">I know most mathematicians don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:31.080" style="s2">large audiences this is not a field any</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:33.570" style="s2">physics has a few tiny number of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.080" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">physicists who have large audiences but</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.570" end="00:46:40.680" style="s2">I really believe that it&#39;s essential for</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:43.440" style="s2">a curation process to happen with this</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.680" end="00:46:47.160" style="s2">kind of work so that people can see more</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.440" end="00:46:49.110" style="s2">of what is out there are you are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.160" end="00:46:51.950" style="s2">open for business will you sell your</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.110" end="00:46:58.130" style="s2">work or you I found you on the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.950" end="00:47:02.100" style="s2">yeah sure yeah yeah okay so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.130" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">supporters of the program can look for</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.100" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">London and his storefront on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">internet somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.130" end="00:47:17.550" style="s2">what about exhibiting with other artists</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.860" end="00:47:19.740" style="s2">and showing this kind of new wave of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.550" end="00:47:22.200" style="s2">whatever we want to call it other than</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.740" end="00:47:23.700" style="s2">mathematical art right oh I&#39;m open to</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.200" end="00:47:25.380" style="s2">that oh yeah yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.700" end="00:47:28.950" style="s2">so you would do it you do like your show</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.380" end="00:47:30.870" style="s2">yeah yeah of course are you up for like</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.950" end="00:47:32.340" style="s2">suggestions I&#39;ve been horrible to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.870" end="00:47:35.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve told you a bunch of things that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.340" end="00:47:37.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve never seen depicted and asked you</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.670" end="00:47:39.150" style="s2">to look in on it is that is that an</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.500" end="00:47:42.060" style="s2">overbearing question no that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.150" end="00:47:47.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a great well I did I did a series</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.060" end="00:47:50.460" style="s2">of talks when I lived in Seattle and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.240" end="00:47:52.170" style="s2">said yeah so I went to University of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.460" end="00:47:55.740" style="s2">Washington where I knew a couple</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.170" end="00:47:59.400" style="s2">mathematicians and it was a series of</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.740" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">works I called demonstrations and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.400" end="00:48:04.740" style="s2">was kind of inspired by the Vinci&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:08.460" style="s2">of scientific drawings the most classy</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.740" end="00:48:11.849" style="s2">Oni and so I invited you dub</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.460" end="00:48:15.329" style="s2">mathematicians to supply me with</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.849" end="00:48:20.099" style="s2">theorems yeah of theirs and I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.329" end="00:48:23.490" style="s2">attempt to come up with my own</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.099" end="00:48:26.609" style="s2">interpretation and so that was a cool</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.490" end="00:48:27.900" style="s2">that was a fun project yeah and I I got</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.609" end="00:48:32.220" style="s2">to know a few mathematicians that to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.900" end="00:48:33.869" style="s2">u-dub and but yeah that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.220" end="00:48:37.339" style="s2">collaboration was was something I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.869" end="00:48:40.589" style="s2">very interested in but 10 years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.339" end="00:48:43.740" style="s2">what are you thinking about now what am</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.589" end="00:48:47.640" style="s2">I thinking about now I&#39;m always open to</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.740" end="00:48:49.769" style="s2">new ideas and your list of topics is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.640" end="00:48:52.430" style="s2">printout I carry with me every day so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.769" end="00:48:56.420" style="s2">I&#39;m always literally on the subway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.430" end="00:48:59.960" style="s2">yeah so a tear some day I tear singer</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.420" end="00:49:03.299" style="s2">and he a singer in the next year yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.960" end="00:49:05.489" style="s2">trying to grab my head around that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.299" end="00:49:09.960" style="s2">think you had something of a curve Air</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.489" end="00:49:13.890" style="s2">Cav air covariant very nice frog yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.960" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s gorgeous stuff yeah and so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.890" end="00:49:19.230" style="s2">yeah I look at it and and I have my I</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:21.420" style="s2">have my mathematician friends and I have</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.230" end="00:49:27.660" style="s2">a whole library of math textbooks that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.420" end="00:49:30.839" style="s2">tried to consult so maybe if I&#39;m correct</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.660" end="00:49:35.819" style="s2">the vector bundle painting that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.839" end="00:49:37.950" style="s2">behind me is masking another work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.819" end="00:49:40.289" style="s2">underneath it maybe we could take the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.950" end="00:49:42.680" style="s2">top painting off and take a look at what</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.289" end="00:49:45.180" style="s2">you have there okay sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.680" end="00:49:47.970" style="s2">all right so London yeah you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.180" end="00:49:51.329" style="s2">unveiled this other structure uh-huh and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.970" end="00:49:53.309" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at it and it&#39;s on its side</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.329" end="00:49:54.960" style="s2">from what I normally expect so that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.309" end="00:49:58.410" style="s2">can get into the shot that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:50:03.589" style="s2">but what it looks to me like is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.410" end="00:50:03.589" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken the light-cone hmm on which</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.739" end="00:50:10.499" style="s2">particles with no rest mass or waves</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.749" end="00:50:13.290" style="s2">with no rest mass propagate inside of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.499" end="00:50:16.350" style="s2">the special theory of relativity</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.290" end="00:50:18.930" style="s2">and then you sort of showed this an</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.350" end="00:50:21.690" style="s2">algebraic how do you say algebraic</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.930" end="00:50:26.540" style="s2">keygen generation mmm so it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.690" end="00:50:26.540" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at some mass shells yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.660" end="00:50:33.240" style="s2">this diagram that should be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.250" end="00:50:35.970" style="s2">from Einstein&#39;s famous annus mirabilis</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.240" end="00:50:39.510" style="s2">of 1905 when he figured out special</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.970" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">relativity has been sort of augmented</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.510" end="00:50:45.390" style="s2">with this extra structure of mass shells</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.180" end="00:50:51.870" style="s2">and hyperboloids and what can you say</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.390" end="00:50:55.380" style="s2">about what motivated you here well so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.870" end="00:50:59.940" style="s2">painted a painting of some of my</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.380" end="00:51:04.020" style="s2">favorite things from calculus 3 quadric</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.940" end="00:51:09.380" style="s2">surfaces and I showed it to lowering -</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.020" end="00:51:14.010" style="s2">and he said well that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.380" end="00:51:17.190" style="s2">but can you tell me how they&#39;re related</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.010" end="00:51:22.460" style="s2">and so that was the direct challenge</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.190" end="00:51:25.320" style="s2">from Loring and so I thought about well</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.460" end="00:51:27.810" style="s2">if I vary a certain parameter this was</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.320" end="00:51:29.790" style="s2">what happened but as I went from one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.810" end="00:51:33.110" style="s2">these types of services to the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.790" end="00:51:36.270" style="s2">type from the hyperboloid of two sheets</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.110" end="00:51:38.610" style="s2">to the hyperbola one sheet I had to go</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.270" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">through the cone and so I showed that</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.610" end="00:51:47.570" style="s2">relation now that was basically the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:50.210" style="s2">behind that piece yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.570" end="00:51:51.900" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.210" end="00:51:58.609" style="s2">do you fall</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.900" end="00:52:03.960" style="s2">and sort of any comparable source of</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.609" end="00:52:09.380" style="s2">rich imagery from any other area other</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.960" end="00:52:15.000" style="s2">than let&#39;s say mathematics and physics I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.380" end="00:52:20.099" style="s2">would say nature are you as fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.000" end="00:52:21.900" style="s2">by it I&#39;m not maybe I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.099" end="00:52:23.279" style="s2">fascinated by it but you know if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.900" end="00:52:24.029" style="s2">walking on the beach and I pick up some</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.279" end="00:52:25.950" style="s2">shells</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.029" end="00:52:30.839" style="s2">no no it&#39;s unbelievably gorgeous but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.950" end="00:52:33.480" style="s2">have to admit that nature weirdly though</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.839" end="00:52:37.099" style="s2">it completely inspires me and I think no</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.480" end="00:52:40.380" style="s2">less than it inspires other people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.099" end="00:52:43.109" style="s2">weirdly slightly less inspired by</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.380" end="00:52:46.049" style="s2">physical nature than I am by what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.109" end="00:52:49.700" style="s2">might call mathematics I have to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.049" end="00:52:53.880" style="s2">the same although I am I&#39;m a scuba diver</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.700" end="00:52:56.039" style="s2">I&#39;m a downhill skier yeah skiing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.880" end="00:52:57.839" style="s2">pretty close to differential job yes it</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.039" end="00:53:02.039" style="s2">is yeah I&#39;m constantly thinking by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:03.809" style="s2">curvature right terrain I&#39;m on yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.039" end="00:53:06.809" style="s2">are you fascinated by in scuba diving</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.809" end="00:53:11.240" style="s2">scuba diving when I go on when I go down</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.809" end="00:53:14.819" style="s2">I just see the strange sea creatures</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.240" end="00:53:17.160" style="s2">residing on the ocean floor or you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.819" end="00:53:19.230" style="s2">on the coral reefs and the shapes of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.160" end="00:53:22.170" style="s2">them any particular ones you&#39;re obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.230" end="00:53:24.510" style="s2">with I can&#39;t say I&#39;m obsessed about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.170" end="00:53:27.710" style="s2">I just find them interesting yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.510" end="00:53:31.230" style="s2">thought maybe cuttlefish cuttlefish I</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.710" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">mean the skin of the cuttlefish is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.230" end="00:53:35.900" style="s2">nearly mathematical phenomena if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:38.910" style="s2">ever watched them propagate these waves</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.900" end="00:53:40.740" style="s2">through the chromatophores on the skin</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.910" end="00:53:44.700" style="s2">when they&#39;re mesmerizing their prey</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.740" end="00:53:46.230" style="s2">before they strike the patterns it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.700" end="00:53:50.279" style="s2">sort of like Times Square with some</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.230" end="00:53:52.980" style="s2">giant neon sign that&#39;s you know moving</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.279" end="00:53:55.230" style="s2">through these pulses of light and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.980" end="00:53:57.770" style="s2">guess I&#39;ve never seen that diving okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.230" end="00:53:57.770" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.010" end="00:54:07.320" style="s2">and in music what do you find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.510" end="00:54:11.280" style="s2">most inspired by I like well when I work</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.320" end="00:54:16.730" style="s2">in my studio I&#39;m often listening to to</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.280" end="00:54:20.070" style="s2">jazz usually Miles Davis Dave Brubeck or</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.730" end="00:54:21.480" style="s2">you know Dave Brubeck obviously famous</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.070" end="00:54:22.950" style="s2">for experimenting with funny time</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.480" end="00:54:26.730" style="s2">signatures which is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.950" end="00:54:28.890" style="s2">mathematical yeah yeah I also listen to</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.730" end="00:54:34.080" style="s2">a lot of classical music yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.890" end="00:54:36.839" style="s2">favorite composer oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.080" end="00:54:38.790" style="s2">rakhmaninov really I never trust a</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:42.300" style="s2">mathematician who doesn&#39;t say Bach first</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.790" end="00:54:45.000" style="s2">I&#39;ll back this chair okay well no maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.300" end="00:54:46.950" style="s2">the ideas here your jam when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.000" end="00:54:51.869" style="s2">no I do love Brendan Burke and Joe yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.950" end="00:54:54.869" style="s2">yeah yeah I rock to that and are you at</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.869" end="00:54:59.690" style="s2">all familiar with any of these attempts</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.869" end="00:55:05.190" style="s2">to push math and reverence for math out</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.690" end="00:55:07.859" style="s2">to the general public that are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.190" end="00:55:09.300" style="s2">off of the direct depiction I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.859" end="00:55:12.180" style="s2">if you&#39;ve ever seen my friend Edward</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.300" end="00:55:16.230" style="s2">Frankel&#39;s a short film love and math</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.180" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">then he wrote a book no I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.230" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen that but a slightly erotic art</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:24.119" style="s2">film really okay no yeah and I guess you</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:26.040" style="s2">know one of the things that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.119" end="00:55:29.210" style="s2">frustrated by is that it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.040" end="00:55:33.119" style="s2">difficult to communicate it a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.210" end="00:55:34.890" style="s2">counterexample to this would be have you</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:37.830" style="s2">ever been to the Exploratorium in San</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.890" end="00:55:39.930" style="s2">Francisco yeah a long time ago then a</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.830" end="00:55:42.119" style="s2">couple decades ago so Frank</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.930" end="00:55:46.140" style="s2">Oppenheimer who is Robert Oppenheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.119" end="00:55:48.450" style="s2">brother created this totally anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.140" end="00:55:50.369" style="s2">Science Museum that was much more</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.450" end="00:55:54.810" style="s2">effective so far as I could tell in</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.369" end="00:55:56.730" style="s2">conveying the wonder of science in a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.810" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">that people actually got some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.730" end="00:56:03.390" style="s2">take home like it was viscerally</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:05.400" style="s2">engaging and yet I didn&#39;t see that kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.390" end="00:56:08.220" style="s2">of Science Museum duplicated anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.400" end="00:56:11.390" style="s2">else yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.220" end="00:56:14.040" style="s2">that might that be a paradigm where</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.390" end="00:56:15.869" style="s2">someone somewhere could do something</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.040" end="00:56:20.570" style="s2">truly unique with the visual depiction</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.869" end="00:56:22.980" style="s2">of geometry and topology let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.570" end="00:56:26.550" style="s2">completely crack this open I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.980" end="00:56:28.740" style="s2">to take the Promethean analogy all it</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.550" end="00:56:34.440" style="s2">really takes is one of us to steal fire</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.740" end="00:56:37.640" style="s2">effect mmm yeah that might work have you</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.440" end="00:56:40.200" style="s2">been to the Google math museum and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.640" end="00:56:42.150" style="s2">Madison Square Park I&#39;ve been to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.200" end="00:56:44.280" style="s2">math user I didn&#39;t yeah is Google</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.150" end="00:56:45.570" style="s2">sponsoring I got a sponsor that Google I</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.280" end="00:56:48.119" style="s2">did maybe I&#39;m wrong I didn&#39;t think was</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.570" end="00:56:49.830" style="s2">okay I didn&#39;t know I just assumed it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.119" end="00:56:52.890" style="s2">yeah I know there was someone inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.830" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">yeah but but yeah a lot of this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.890" end="00:56:58.700" style="s2">is sort of strangely slightly off</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:57:02.460" style="s2">there&#39;s this beautiful limestone wall in</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.700" end="00:57:05.300" style="s2">Stony Brook mass Stony Brook Long Island</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.460" end="00:57:08.430" style="s2">that has some of the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.300" end="00:57:14.130" style="s2">formulas in all of mathematics and some</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.430" end="00:57:16.800" style="s2">pictures but it to me even that has like</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.130" end="00:57:19.830" style="s2">errors and flaws and it doesn&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.800" end="00:57:24.720" style="s2">evoke what it is that it was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.830" end="00:57:26.700" style="s2">depict I feel like we&#39;ve failed well</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.720" end="00:57:30.540" style="s2">yeah I feel that - I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.700" end="00:57:32.880" style="s2">partially why I don&#39;t think of my art as</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.540" end="00:57:35.460" style="s2">a mathematical art because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.880" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">it to be associated with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.460" end="00:57:40.470" style="s2">like oh bring math to the people that</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:45.900" style="s2">kind of thing it has to be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.470" end="00:57:48.390" style="s2">something I mean like the wonder of math</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.900" end="00:57:51.630" style="s2">that we experience them yeah that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.390" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">is not I don&#39;t I don&#39;t feel that when I</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.630" end="00:57:55.890" style="s2">could and look at these kind of displays</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:57.570" style="s2">of mathematic art oh how interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.890" end="00:57:59.640" style="s2">these things fit together right and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.570" end="00:58:00.990" style="s2">you&#39;re just like okay let me just you</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.640" end="00:58:02.670" style="s2">know play with this a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.990" end="00:58:04.380" style="s2">then move on to this other exhibit and</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.670" end="00:58:10.890" style="s2">here not what did you feel when you when</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.380" end="00:58:13.280" style="s2">you look at Escher um I didn&#39;t well my</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.890" end="00:58:15.510" style="s2">initial reaction when people were oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.280" end="00:58:19.349" style="s2">you&#39;re a math major you should love</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.510" end="00:58:21.150" style="s2">Asher I think that&#39;s great you know I</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.349" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">viewed the art in the math is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.150" end="00:58:23.360" style="s2">straight</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:25.100" style="s2">we separate and it was a great way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.360" end="00:58:27.500" style="s2">getting a certain amount of math out</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.100" end="00:58:29.600" style="s2">into the world yeah but I did and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.500" end="00:58:32.570" style="s2">found him quite artistic I just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.600" end="00:58:36.010" style="s2">feel that the art and the math were</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.570" end="00:58:39.910" style="s2">always kind of hand in glove</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.010" end="00:58:42.170" style="s2">yeah like well first of all like</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.910" end="00:58:45.230" style="s2">symmetry groups of the plane I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.170" end="00:58:48.500" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s cool but still there&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.230" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t capture the real depth of</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.500" end="00:58:51.530" style="s2">math yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s so much more</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:54.500" style="s2">to math than just kind of pretty</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.530" end="00:58:57.830" style="s2">patterns or symmetrical patterns are you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.500" end="00:59:02.420" style="s2">obsessed with the physics not as much as</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.830" end="00:59:05.960" style="s2">I as I wish to be yeah I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.420" end="00:59:08.630" style="s2">the great mysteries for me has been why</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.960" end="00:59:11.060" style="s2">is it the physical universe is such an</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.630" end="00:59:14.090" style="s2">amazing client of the best mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.060" end="00:59:16.100" style="s2">Frank right like you&#39;ve done this with</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.090" end="00:59:17.900" style="s2">substandard mathematics maybe just a</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.100" end="00:59:20.990" style="s2">little bit of calculus and cement linear</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.900" end="00:59:23.600" style="s2">algebra but it just goes way above and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.990" end="00:59:26.300" style="s2">beyond and actually uses our best stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.600" end="00:59:27.890" style="s2">our most beautiful stuff now I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.300" end="00:59:29.720" style="s2">thought that was quite odd that it</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.890" end="00:59:33.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to be the way the biological</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.720" end="00:59:37.460" style="s2">world does not seem to use mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.590" end="00:59:38.930" style="s2">in the at a truly profound level there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.460" end="00:59:40.910" style="s2">some cute stuff with like Fibonacci</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.930" end="00:59:43.460" style="s2">sequences right and I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.910" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">biological world mostly turned up its</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.460" end="00:59:48.610" style="s2">nose at the mathematical offerings that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:52.370" style="s2">that were possible right very right I</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.610" end="00:59:54.290" style="s2">guess I see physics and math is so like</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.370" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">intertwine intertwine well you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.290" end="00:59:59.060" style="s2">there&#39;s this expression the map is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="01:00:00.770" style="s2">the territory and I think that the weird</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.060" end="01:00:03.140" style="s2">thing about physics is that physics may</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.770" end="01:00:05.570" style="s2">be the one place in the real world in</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.140" end="01:00:07.100" style="s2">which the map that is the math that</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.570" end="01:00:09.350" style="s2">describes it may actually be the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.100" end="01:00:13.400" style="s2">territory that is mmm it would not</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.350" end="01:00:15.500" style="s2">astound me if life really was about</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.400" end="01:00:17.650" style="s2">vector bundles principal bundles and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.500" end="01:00:22.370" style="s2">wave equations that take place upon yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.650" end="01:00:24.290" style="s2">yeah yeah so we&#39;re gonna try to figure</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.370" end="01:00:26.060" style="s2">out how to get you is part of an</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.290" end="01:00:29.030" style="s2">exhibition so people can come and see</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.060" end="01:00:30.780" style="s2">your work and they can find you on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.030" end="01:00:34.530" style="s2">internet you have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.780" end="01:00:38.580" style="s2">a site yeah so my site is just London&#39;s</p>
