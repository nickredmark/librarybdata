<p begin="00:01:01.429" end="00:01:06.400" style="s2">and I will be talking about how to find</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.890" end="00:01:10.190" style="s2">the frontiers of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:12.110" style="s2">earlier today I published an essay</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.190" end="00:01:15.140" style="s2">that&#39;s based on a previous talk I had</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.110" end="00:01:17.000" style="s2">given on the topic I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.140" end="00:01:19.490" style="s2">easy to talk and it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.000" end="00:01:21.380" style="s2">to talk about things such as ystem ology</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.490" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">making sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.380" end="00:01:26.870" style="s2">institutional decay transmission of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:29.390" style="s2">knowledge and so on this is just very</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.870" end="00:01:31.700" style="s2">intellectually stimulating stuff but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.390" end="00:01:34.370" style="s2">ultimate test of it in my opinion is is</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.700" end="00:01:37.760" style="s2">it practical right can it be practically</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.370" end="00:01:40.310" style="s2">applied in this essay and also like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.760" end="00:01:42.830" style="s2">little bit in this talk I dropped the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.310" end="00:01:44.750" style="s2">links in the in the chat section I try</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.830" end="00:01:47.990" style="s2">to apply it in a straightforward way I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.750" end="00:01:50.150" style="s2">think that fields have not yet been</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.990" end="00:01:53.420" style="s2">fully defined so we have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.150" end="00:01:55.700" style="s2">exhausted the possible intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.420" end="00:01:57.680" style="s2">questions we can ask that are worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.700" end="00:02:00.050" style="s2">years of study order it might have</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.680" end="00:02:02.210" style="s2">multiple breakthroughs left in them just</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.050" end="00:02:04.580" style="s2">as in the 1820s there was no conception</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.210" end="00:02:07.940" style="s2">of biochemistry but the next field of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.580" end="00:02:09.590" style="s2">biochemistry remains to be made if</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.940" end="00:02:11.810" style="s2">you&#39;re searching for the existing</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.590" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">institutions to provide you with an</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.790" end="00:02:17.810" style="s2">disappointed there&#39;s actually no</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.260" end="00:02:19.670" style="s2">possible way to do it especially I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.810" end="00:02:21.980" style="s2">argue in an academic context where you</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.670" end="00:02:24.489" style="s2">are rewarded for making small claims not</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.980" end="00:02:27.469" style="s2">rewarded for making large productive</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:34.200" style="s2">have to do large exploratory hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.860" end="00:02:36.780" style="s2">that completely reinterpret the old set</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.200" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">of data right the methodological jump</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.780" end="00:02:41.910" style="s2">from anthropology to sociology to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">economics to political science you might</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.910" end="00:02:45.540" style="s2">be describing the exact same political</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:47.610" style="s2">phenomena which are going to be using</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.540" end="00:02:49.350" style="s2">different standards and relying on</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.610" end="00:02:51.630" style="s2">different literature&#39;s for each of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.350" end="00:02:53.610" style="s2">right so even if we&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.630" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">small subset of a problem such as</p>

<p begin="00:03:04.470" end="00:03:09.660" style="s2">institutional context it&#39;s usually not</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:11.790" style="s2">going to be recognized by intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.660" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">authorities there&#39;s a reason the term</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.790" end="00:03:16.440" style="s2">crackpot carries the stigma that it does</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">because it suggests an anti-social</p>

<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:26.520" style="s2">a possibly bad set of fact-checking I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:03:26.520" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">crackpot doesn&#39;t even imply that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:32.519" style="s2">person is wrong I think the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2">connotation is that it&#39;s an outsider</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.519" end="00:03:37.260" style="s2">that the person is an outcast that their</p>

<p begin="00:03:37.260" end="00:03:42.090" style="s2">no bearing on the world to make an</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">argument that this is in fact the common</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.090" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">usage I know - the role of crackpots in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:47.459" style="s2">Hollywood movies right if we take</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">Hollywood movies to be a good</p>

<p begin="00:03:58.620" end="00:04:03.690" style="s2">person is usually right in a Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.570" end="00:04:05.700" style="s2">movie but there&#39;s still like this person</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.690" end="00:04:07.709" style="s2">that you don&#39;t want to be or don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="00:04:07.709" end="00:04:13.110" style="s2">so what&#39;s up with that and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.350" end="00:04:15.510" style="s2">very we love pretending that it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.110" end="00:04:18.030" style="s2">know the epistemology is so bad and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.510" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">if only the thinking is good we will put</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.030" end="00:04:21.750" style="s2">it up in Center and the thinking the</p>

<p begin="00:04:26.729" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">this is the case we also firmly believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s like massive</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:34.620" style="s2">gatekeeping and that the narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:36.599" style="s2">massively controlled and that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.619" end="00:05:03.739" style="s2">we legitimize the insanity by recourse</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.659" end="00:05:40.429" style="s2">should then take a look where would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.369" end="00:05:42.379" style="s2">easiest to study where will you be both</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.429" end="00:05:44.449" style="s2">the best informed by an existing</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.379" end="00:05:47.629" style="s2">tradition of knowledge that has highly</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.260" end="00:08:55.150" style="s2">risk and the bundle risk and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.780" end="00:08:57.610" style="s2">that&#39;s very important many people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.150" end="00:09:00.070" style="s2">lie on these communities for what in</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.790" end="00:09:28.040" style="s2">sculpting or mathematics and you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.060" end="00:09:30.290" style="s2">just try and actually learn from those</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.040" end="00:09:32.570" style="s2">directly really nothing stops you you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.290" end="00:09:33.829" style="s2">can easily send them a cold email you</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.570" end="00:09:36.380" style="s2">can show up at their home do their</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.380" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">papers maybe co-author with them knowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.529" end="00:09:43.339" style="s2">that they get the lion&#39;s share of the</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.089" end="00:09:57.410" style="s2">you start by evaluating institutions you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.709" end="00:10:00.290" style="s2">then go and evaluate the sociological</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.410" end="00:10:02.420" style="s2">reality of the institutions and then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.290" end="00:10:03.949" style="s2">choose whether to institutionalize</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.420" end="00:10:06.019" style="s2">yourself and note if you&#39;re going into</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.949" end="00:10:08.149" style="s2">an R&amp;D lab you are institutionalizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.019" end="00:10:09.800" style="s2">yourself just as much as if you checked</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.149" end="00:10:11.990" style="s2">yourself into a hospital or into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.800" end="00:10:14.209" style="s2">prison right we live in extremely</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.990" end="00:10:14.990" style="s2">regimented societies sometimes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.209" end="00:10:16.370" style="s2">the right call</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.990" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually a burden of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.370" end="00:10:20.209" style="s2">to show that it&#39;s the right call either</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:22.730" style="s2">you go this type of institutionalization</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.209" end="00:10:24.740" style="s2">and the sociological sense you either</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.730" end="00:10:27.890" style="s2">join the community of practice that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.740" end="00:10:30.140" style="s2">still has a landscape of social</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.890" end="00:10:32.329" style="s2">incentives that point towards the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.140" end="00:10:35.000" style="s2">intellectual excellence and skill in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.329" end="00:10:37.010" style="s2">domain or you basically try to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.000" end="00:10:39.800" style="s2">apprentice yourself to someone and make</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.010" end="00:10:42.649" style="s2">it economically and socially viable for</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.800" end="00:10:45.230" style="s2">them to invest massively into you if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.649" end="00:10:46.970" style="s2">are an asset you will be invested in if</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.230" end="00:10:48.890" style="s2">you are competitor you will not be</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.970" end="00:10:50.779" style="s2">invested in I think this is just so</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.890" end="00:10:53.420" style="s2">deeply deeply true and it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.779" end="00:10:56.300" style="s2">reasons also that the current doctoral</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.420" end="00:10:58.279" style="s2">adviser or system is a fraud it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.300" end="00:11:01.160" style="s2">fraud because the doctoral advisors have</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.279" end="00:11:02.870" style="s2">no personal career stake in the success</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.160" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">of their own students that would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.870" end="00:11:06.769" style="s2">commensurate with the investment they</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:09.319" style="s2">would have to given their students</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.769" end="00:11:11.269" style="s2">so what persists then is only the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.319" end="00:11:13.370" style="s2">economically exploitive relationship as</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.269" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">you know again well pointed out by</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.370" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">others so I would love to hear questions</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.180" end="00:11:25.410" style="s2">talked through some of these ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.980" end="00:11:27.870" style="s2">where you can pursue excellent knowledge</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.260" end="00:12:15.030" style="s2">to be adaptive to new circumstances I</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.630" end="00:12:17.190" style="s2">think many life players you know some of</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.420" end="00:12:47.190" style="s2">by doing the thing that actually makes</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.400" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">put this knockoff of knowledge I think a</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.320" end="00:13:04.680" style="s2">energy in you know these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.750" end="00:13:06.900" style="s2">ego-syntonic fantasies where they pursue</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.680" end="00:13:10.110" style="s2">the appearance of knowledge so much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.900" end="00:13:14.070" style="s2">than in substance and I think that right</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.110" end="00:13:16.530" style="s2">now one of the key tasks at hand is have</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.070" end="00:13:18.510" style="s2">there being enough individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.530" end="00:13:21.410" style="s2">live players that they can generate</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.510" end="00:13:23.790" style="s2">entirely new frontiers of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:26.940" style="s2">operationalize that knowledge in action</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.790" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">so I think that it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.940" end="00:13:32.730" style="s2">it either young or old so this applies</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:33.200" style="s2">as much to the 40 or 50 year old</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.470" end="00:13:54.590" style="s2">brain power to the substance of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.030" end="00:13:56.540" style="s2">knowledge rather than the appearance of</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.310" end="00:14:02.870" style="s2">signaling and just like look at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.780" end="00:14:05.180" style="s2">thing itself and only if just a few</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.870" end="00:14:07.790" style="s2">people do this I think we are vastly</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.790" end="00:14:13.460" style="s2">I also think that recognizing people how</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.350" end="00:15:04.010" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty pretty um do you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.970" end="00:15:07.610" style="s2">there&#39;s currently enough economic and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.010" end="00:15:08.990" style="s2">human surplus today that if there were a</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.000" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">to classical academia would be viable</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:20.390" style="s2">to current academia because I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.500" end="00:15:23.660" style="s2">current academia is like ludicrously</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.390" end="00:15:26.270" style="s2">human capital inefficient and it&#39;s also</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.270" end="00:15:30.980" style="s2">think it would be very easy to compete</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.400" end="00:15:32.810" style="s2">with literally all of contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.980" end="00:15:36.140" style="s2">academia in the narrow domain of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.810" end="00:15:39.170" style="s2">knowledge production for about two</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.140" end="00:15:42.670" style="s2">billion dollars a year and something</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.170" end="00:15:45.050" style="s2">like 300 very very talented thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.670" end="00:15:47.080" style="s2">beginning would be just very easy to do</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.080" end="00:15:51.950" style="s2">you know if you didn&#39;t want to compete</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.060" end="00:15:53.690" style="s2">but merely wanted to push on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.950" end="00:15:56.270" style="s2">productive frontier it could probably be</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.690" end="00:15:58.220" style="s2">done with 50 excellent people and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.270" end="00:16:02.270" style="s2">something like a hundred million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.220" end="00:16:03.350" style="s2">a year but you know I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.270" end="00:16:06.110" style="s2">best way to think about contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.350" end="00:16:09.290" style="s2">academia is that they are a that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.110" end="00:16:11.740" style="s2">know they are they&#39;re the cult of the</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.840" end="00:16:18.590" style="s2">grown to vast proportions like I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.090" end="00:16:20.090" style="s2">you know in the distant future there</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.590" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">should definitely be librarians there</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.090" end="00:16:23.540" style="s2">should be many of them but they</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:25.190" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be pretending that they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.540" end="00:16:27.620" style="s2">the originators of most human knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.190" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not and this like strategic</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.620" end="00:16:32.840" style="s2">overreach of academia into the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:34.430" style="s2">all knowledge production just because</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.840" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">there was some talented academics in</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">who by the way learn how to think</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.110" end="00:16:42.680" style="s2">outside of academia right like you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">Einstein and so on right</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.680" end="00:16:46.630" style="s2">or learned in an academia that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:49.210" style="s2">really different from current academia</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.630" end="00:16:51.080" style="s2">like that just seems this vast</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.210" end="00:16:53.270" style="s2">structural overstretch and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.080" end="00:16:55.190" style="s2">connecting into a system of indentured</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.270" end="00:16:57.560" style="s2">labor such as the grad school student</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.190" end="00:16:59.090" style="s2">system that&#39;s like bizarre I think like</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.560" end="00:17:01.760" style="s2">you know future historians will likely</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.090" end="00:17:05.990" style="s2">be having a field day trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.760" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">this to future societies so classical</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.990" end="00:17:09.440" style="s2">academia though I think was more</p>

<p begin="00:17:14.420" end="00:17:18.800" style="s2">socio-economic system or was inherently</p>

<p begin="00:17:30.230" end="00:17:35.150" style="s2">mobility because upward social mobility</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.360" end="00:17:37.490" style="s2">is about relative position so it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.020" end="00:18:09.490" style="s2">produces the most index cards</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.490" end="00:18:14.690" style="s2">library is not a bad place to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.810" end="00:18:17.480" style="s2">thinking so if you can publish once</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.690" end="00:18:19.340" style="s2">every few years and you&#39;re fine and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.480" end="00:18:21.320" style="s2">present your own findings in you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.340" end="00:18:23.030" style="s2">immediately catalog your own findings</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.320" end="00:18:25.880" style="s2">that would be a pretty good way to</p>

<p begin="00:19:09.770" end="00:19:13.490" style="s2">50 people you would probably need like 2</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.420" end="00:19:15.890" style="s2">or 3 million a year I know a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.490" end="00:19:17.810" style="s2">more depends on where they live they</p>

<p begin="00:19:22.910" end="00:19:27.800" style="s2">you know you know if you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.790" end="00:19:30.140" style="s2">ancient era of the Bronze Age with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.800" end="00:19:32.090" style="s2">massive palace where the god king</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.140" end="00:19:34.700" style="s2">resides with it massive pillars and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.090" end="00:19:36.110" style="s2">halls and gold decorations on that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.700" end="00:19:37.850" style="s2">really not for the king it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:39.710" style="s2">like uncomfortable actually living in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.850" end="00:19:41.150" style="s2">Versailles your food is always cold</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.710" end="00:19:42.670" style="s2">because it takes forever to get it from</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.150" end="00:19:45.320" style="s2">the kitchen to where you&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.670" end="00:19:47.930" style="s2">but the palace isn&#39;t for you it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.320" end="00:19:49.850" style="s2">the subjects so I think one hundred</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.930" end="00:19:52.730" style="s2">million dollars is the amount of money I</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.850" end="00:19:55.180" style="s2">think even with good PR strategy that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.730" end="00:19:57.500" style="s2">needed for modern America society to not</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.180" end="00:19:59.990" style="s2">to say those 50 people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.500" end="00:20:01.580" style="s2">great researchers rather than crackpots</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.990" end="00:20:04.340" style="s2">it&#39;s just that&#39;s just the money it takes</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.580" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">to do that okay thank you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.340" end="00:20:11.900" style="s2">that was that was usable information</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.059" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">I don&#39;t endorse splintering away from it</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:36.110" style="s2">Thank You Billy yeah have you heard of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:38.290" style="s2">this term super connector and and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.110" end="00:20:42.020" style="s2">is the role of these super connectors in</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.290" end="00:20:43.220" style="s2">helping like helping domains of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.020" end="00:20:46.429" style="s2">knowledge that aren&#39;t talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.220" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">other to communicate and and collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.429" end="00:20:52.220" style="s2">and and the role of super connector is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:56.870" style="s2">also to have an intuition about what</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.220" end="00:21:00.500" style="s2">things might have something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.870" end="00:21:04.130" style="s2">synergistic between some people I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.500" end="00:21:07.250" style="s2">the super connectors are a mathematize</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.130" end="00:21:10.190" style="s2">ation and subset of a much stronger term</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.250" end="00:21:12.980" style="s2">socialite the positive social role of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.190" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">socialites is to be full-time super</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.980" end="00:21:18.790" style="s2">connectors that is people who know many</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:21.230" style="s2">individuals and have in their recall</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.790" end="00:21:24.230" style="s2">immediately the skill sets of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.230" end="00:21:26.450" style="s2">individuals but unlike super connectors</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.230" end="00:21:28.010" style="s2">right super connectors aren&#39;t implied</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.450" end="00:21:30.110" style="s2">usually to be tracking people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.010" end="00:21:31.790" style="s2">emotional states I actually think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.110" end="00:21:33.500" style="s2">socialite tracks people&#39;s emotional</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.790" end="00:21:36.679" style="s2">states thereby is essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.500" end="00:21:39.380" style="s2">matchmaker for teams and I think because</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.679" end="00:21:41.870" style="s2">the financial mechanisms are terrible</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.380" end="00:21:44.090" style="s2">for matchmaking teams you have to rely</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.870" end="00:21:46.490" style="s2">on social mechanisms so would actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.090" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">say that the best super connectors are</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.490" end="00:21:51.590" style="s2">socialites in very well-developed scenes</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:53.960" style="s2">that they have gardened</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.590" end="00:21:55.730" style="s2">where these social incentives are</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.960" end="00:21:58.250" style="s2">connected with the right type of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.730" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">economic privilege so that the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.250" end="00:22:03.770" style="s2">providing social goods are compensated</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:05.750" style="s2">economically if you try to make it all</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.770" end="00:22:07.790" style="s2">be market driven it just doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.750" end="00:22:09.710" style="s2">out somehow or it&#39;s super tricky to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.790" end="00:22:11.690" style="s2">right so what you actually have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.710" end="00:22:14.090" style="s2">I&#39;m invoking privilege as a technical</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.690" end="00:22:16.490" style="s2">concept and many concepts privilege is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.090" end="00:22:19.130" style="s2">strictly negative but I think here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.490" end="00:22:21.830" style="s2">actually positive because it allows so</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.130" end="00:22:24.700" style="s2">economic abundance for a limited scene</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.830" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">of people and then if the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.700" end="00:22:28.870" style="s2">social incentives are correct in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:31.180" style="s2">limited scene of people the socialites</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.870" end="00:22:32.920" style="s2">can do their work full-time and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.180" end="00:22:35.140" style="s2">becomes ludicrously intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.920" end="00:22:38.200" style="s2">productive I would say the Royal Society</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.140" end="00:22:40.450" style="s2">was originally at this basically bored</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.200" end="00:22:41.680" style="s2">aristocrats inviting each other to check</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.450" end="00:22:43.870" style="s2">out each other&#39;s edgings</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.680" end="00:22:46.270" style="s2">right come see my etchings oh I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.870" end="00:22:48.010" style="s2">come see my rock collection or come see</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.270" end="00:22:50.680" style="s2">my plant collection or come see my like</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.010" end="00:22:53.620" style="s2">telescope isn&#39;t this a baptist curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.680" end="00:22:56.260" style="s2">come see my library the integration of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.620" end="00:22:59.500" style="s2">social life intellectual contribution</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.260" end="00:23:01.030" style="s2">and like economic abundance that you see</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.500" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">in the Royal Society is like sounds</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.030" end="00:23:05.800" style="s2">fabulous if you would describe this in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:07.540" style="s2">concrete terms to like anyone who today</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.800" end="00:23:09.430" style="s2">is laboring as an academic or as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.540" end="00:23:12.040" style="s2">programmer as whatever it&#39;s like in</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.430" end="00:23:15.010" style="s2">those conditions like generativity is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.040" end="00:23:19.270" style="s2">given right you are competing to be as</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.010" end="00:23:20.980" style="s2">generative as you can be and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.270" end="00:23:23.590" style="s2">that those are very difficult to set up</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.980" end="00:23:26.560" style="s2">I think some scenes in music and art</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.590" end="00:23:29.050" style="s2">recreate this because the artists have</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.560" end="00:23:30.730" style="s2">this alchemy where you know they find to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.050" end="00:23:33.100" style="s2">have an earnest relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.730" end="00:23:35.040" style="s2">patron with some money and taste and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.100" end="00:23:37.630" style="s2">creative person with the actual energy</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.040" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">there is a genuine social relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.630" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">between them it&#39;s it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:45.310" style="s2">feel negative if it feels negative this</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:47.290" style="s2">means the social fabric isn&#39;t there so</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.310" end="00:23:48.940" style="s2">he feels exploited of this already means</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.290" end="00:23:50.920" style="s2">something has gone wrong this already</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.940" end="00:23:54.340" style="s2">means the scene is not as creative</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.920" end="00:23:55.720" style="s2">culturally as it could be so uh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.340" end="00:23:57.280" style="s2">instead of just answering a narrow</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.720" end="00:23:59.320" style="s2">question about super connectors I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.280" end="00:24:01.180" style="s2">pointed to a different type of social</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.320" end="00:24:03.100" style="s2">ideal and then I talked too much about</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.180" end="00:24:05.890" style="s2">this social technology that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.100" end="00:24:08.290" style="s2">behind societies research societies and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.890" end="00:24:10.840" style="s2">behind salons and behind the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.290" end="00:24:12.760" style="s2">many fields like say I would argue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.840" end="00:24:15.610" style="s2">not just a royal society like the origin</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.760" end="00:24:17.830" style="s2">of archaeology came out of the same type</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.610" end="00:24:20.170" style="s2">of social environment where people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.830" end="00:24:21.790" style="s2">are already well-off sort of competing</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.170" end="00:24:23.680" style="s2">with each other on the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.790" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">knowledge and having both enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.680" end="00:24:27.730" style="s2">intellectual and social savvy to not</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:29.560" style="s2">they&#39;re not social savvy to not be</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.730" end="00:24:33.240" style="s2">crackpots and enough intellectual savvy</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.560" end="00:24:35.380" style="s2">to like you know be not be charlatans</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.240" end="00:24:38.950" style="s2">cool so I hope that that answers the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.380" end="00:24:43.090" style="s2">question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.950" end="00:24:45.960" style="s2">great said would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.090" end="00:24:49.180" style="s2">question yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.960" end="00:24:51.160" style="s2">so do you think that live players tend</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.180" end="00:24:53.910" style="s2">to acquire knowledge through one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.160" end="00:24:57.910" style="s2">paths you mentioned rather than others</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.910" end="00:25:00.040" style="s2">like say apprenticeship or a community</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.910" end="00:25:02.050" style="s2">of knowledge or in the case of me one</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.040" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">last thing and what i Didact and just</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.050" end="00:25:05.620" style="s2">doing a lot of reading and how would you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:09.130" style="s2">contrast the different approaches</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.620" end="00:25:11.680" style="s2">between live players well I think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.130" end="00:25:13.870" style="s2">it depends both on the strengths of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.680" end="00:25:16.750" style="s2">person but it also depends on the state</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.870" end="00:25:19.870" style="s2">of knowledge I think you know Auto</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.750" end="00:25:22.690" style="s2">tactus ISM is particularly potent when</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.870" end="00:25:25.930" style="s2">there has not been that much good work</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.690" end="00:25:28.030" style="s2">done or when the good work that had been</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.930" end="00:25:31.060" style="s2">done in the past is mostly abandoned so</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.030" end="00:25:33.670" style="s2">say if you wanted to do science being an</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.060" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">autodidact was a great idea in 1550</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.670" end="00:25:37.780" style="s2">because you&#39;re kind of at the dawn of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:39.550" style="s2">the Renaissance you can easily like do</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.780" end="00:25:41.560" style="s2">some private experiments and read some</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.550" end="00:25:43.270" style="s2">Aristotle and figure out wait we can we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.560" end="00:25:45.250" style="s2">can extend Aristotle or we can disprove</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.630" end="00:28:25.610" style="s2">five or six excellent ideas that will</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.670" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">probably be breakthrough papers but he</p>

<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:32.530" style="s2">he got it from Newton stuck like this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:35.630" style="s2">just happens all the time by the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.530" end="00:28:38.870" style="s2">people are inspired by sources that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.630" end="00:28:40.520" style="s2">ultimately not credited so it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.870" end="00:28:43.100" style="s2">difficult to figure out what the live</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.720" end="00:28:52.550" style="s2">also saying that I think most</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.870" end="00:28:54.920" style="s2">specifically theorizing about human</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.550" end="00:28:57.290" style="s2">psychology and the interrelation of</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.290" end="00:29:01.190" style="s2">Aquinas is theology it&#39;s very clear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.420" end="00:29:02.690" style="s2">talking about the specifications of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.190" end="00:29:04.700" style="s2">emotions and when they appear when they</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.690" end="00:29:05.480" style="s2">don&#39;t appear it&#39;s not just making claims</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.700" end="00:29:09.019" style="s2">about metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.480" end="00:29:12.350" style="s2">it&#39;s making claims about the mind so if</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.019" end="00:29:15.649" style="s2">people gave Newton&#39;s writing on that as</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.350" end="00:29:17.659" style="s2">much benefit of the doubt as they gave</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.649" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">Buddhists writing I think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.659" end="00:29:22.580" style="s2">interesting breakthroughs to be had but</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:24.769" style="s2">the work of laundering Buddhism through</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.580" end="00:29:26.690" style="s2">science it was only recently undertaken</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.769" end="00:29:28.789" style="s2">in California so maybe one day Newton</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.690" end="00:29:34.549" style="s2">will also be laundered through modern</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.789" end="00:29:35.809" style="s2">science cool next question yeah Danielle</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.549" end="00:29:45.080" style="s2">would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.809" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">Oh your audio seems dead uh yes okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.080" end="00:29:50.779" style="s2">great yeah so when I asked the question</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:52.639" style="s2">you have to get it specifically spoken</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.779" end="00:29:54.620" style="s2">seems and the past I think three</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.639" end="00:30:00.230" style="s2">questions you speaking excessively sings</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.620" end="00:30:02.360" style="s2">so I will try to extend I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.230" end="00:30:05.179" style="s2">extend the question since you&#39;ve covered</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.360" end="00:30:07.370" style="s2">so much already this is basically I know</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.179" end="00:30:09.559" style="s2">that it&#39;s there aren&#39;t a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.370" end="00:30:11.389" style="s2">visible live players right now there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.559" end="00:30:13.399" style="s2">a lot of scenes you know they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.389" end="00:30:16.789" style="s2">things showing up on the crackling side</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.399" end="00:30:19.159" style="s2">and they&#39;re sputtering out what are ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.789" end="00:30:21.169" style="s2">that some are sputtering out what do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.159" end="00:30:23.750" style="s2">think might be the best chance is to</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.169" end="00:30:27.470" style="s2">like take one and get it to not sputter</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.750" end="00:30:30.049" style="s2">out throw it from there so say assembly</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.470" end="00:30:31.220" style="s2">you what there&#39;s natural world I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.049" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">know we could have also talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.220" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">making a new one but really is there a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:38.690" style="s2">sign of life anywhere because everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:40.700" style="s2">asking where let me go what if leave the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.690" end="00:30:43.460" style="s2">cities maybe where do you go you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.700" end="00:30:46.730" style="s2">the United States fleeing you know this</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.460" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">is a good one of Constantinople getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.730" end="00:30:50.149" style="s2">taken over by the Turks and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.799" style="s2">everyone ends up in Pisa and then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.149" end="00:30:55.789" style="s2">get the Renaissance so is it less</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.799" end="00:30:56.809" style="s2">equivalent I mean I think you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.789" end="00:30:58.789" style="s2">asking about the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.809" end="00:31:01.760" style="s2">productivity of cities here implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.789" end="00:31:03.380" style="s2">where cities cities a scene as always</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:05.000" style="s2">hosted in a city right and depending on</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.380" end="00:31:08.179" style="s2">the era it might be Paris right the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.000" end="00:31:10.250" style="s2">Paris of the salons it might be ancient</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.179" end="00:31:13.130" style="s2">Alexandria people don&#39;t know this but</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.250" end="00:31:14.690" style="s2">briefly a British occupied Alexandria</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.130" end="00:31:16.870" style="s2">was also an intellectual center where</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.690" end="00:31:21.549" style="s2">random Europeans would go and hang out</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.870" end="00:31:29.230" style="s2">um yeah and Vienna was such a city and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.549" end="00:31:31.000" style="s2">so on well the thing is that I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.230" end="00:31:35.020" style="s2">there are several scenes that are quite</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.000" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">intellectually productive that have but</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.020" end="00:31:40.929" style="s2">I think it&#39;s always useful to if you see</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:43.900" style="s2">a failed scene or a dying scene that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.929" end="00:31:45.730" style="s2">take a subset of the people and redefine</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.900" end="00:31:48.220" style="s2">something right next to the old scene</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.730" end="00:31:50.500" style="s2">that however only attracts this subset</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.220" end="00:31:55.870" style="s2">because two to three reasons</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.500" end="00:31:58.450" style="s2">signal-to-noise ratio number two the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.870" end="00:32:01.360" style="s2">ability to forge new Ledger&#39;s of social</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.450" end="00:32:03.279" style="s2">accounting because if I know someone in</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:04.899" style="s2">the context where we are both like say</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.279" end="00:32:07.149" style="s2">Mormons and we&#39;re members of the Mormon</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.899" end="00:32:08.740" style="s2">Church or something like this and all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.149" end="00:32:10.510" style="s2">these like ways in which we track our</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.740" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">behavior towards each other it produces</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.510" end="00:32:14.049" style="s2">the equivalent of like an economic</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:16.179" style="s2">ledger like a set of depths debts and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.049" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">on so there has to be a way for the old</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.179" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">scene to declare a jubilee where the old</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:22.779" style="s2">debts are forgiven so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.549" style="s2">creating a completely new scene where</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.779" end="00:32:26.710" style="s2">the old Ledger&#39;s of accounting are no</p>

<p begin="00:33:55.740" end="00:33:58.860" style="s2">spots for this because they&#39;re close</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.290" end="00:34:22.020" style="s2">think on the East Coast there might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.100" end="00:34:24.450" style="s2">an argument to be made for like some</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.090" end="00:34:31.380" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to do something around New</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">York I think in Europe but Berlin will</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.380" end="00:34:37.409" style="s2">be a fad I think Berlin will grow to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:39.390" style="s2">an ever bigger city over time and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.409" end="00:34:41.159" style="s2">of the stuff will you know 20 years from</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:55.470" style="s2">yeah thank you great so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.440" end="00:34:56.520" style="s2">question from Charlie and I was hoping</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.470" end="00:34:58.140" style="s2">that you could connect Charlie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.520" end="00:35:00.120" style="s2">question to a question that I was asked</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.140" end="00:35:02.550" style="s2">to read as well which is have you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.120" end="00:35:05.130" style="s2">identified any live players in STEM</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.550" end="00:35:08.160" style="s2">academia and then Charlie if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.130" end="00:35:10.350" style="s2">ask your question oh thank you yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.160" end="00:35:14.330" style="s2">interested in the idea of seniors and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.350" end="00:35:17.190" style="s2">how that overlaps with new knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.330" end="00:35:19.260" style="s2">you were talking earlier about there</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.190" end="00:35:22.080" style="s2">being these really happening creative</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.260" end="00:35:24.030" style="s2">scenes but that they I&#39;m thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.080" end="00:35:27.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily give rise to new</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.030" end="00:35:28.890" style="s2">knowledge so where is new knowledge at</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.240" end="00:35:33.270" style="s2">the moment where do you see it happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.890" end="00:35:37.620" style="s2">and can you generalize about how the new</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.270" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">knowledge comes about as separate to how</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.620" end="00:35:44.280" style="s2">a senior&#39;s comes about and some seniors</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:46.500" style="s2">of culturally creators happening stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.280" end="00:35:54.120" style="s2">and maybe something about what the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.500" end="00:35:55.980" style="s2">overlap is well I think that the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.120" end="00:35:58.040" style="s2">cultures must exist on the frontier of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.980" end="00:36:00.840" style="s2">possibility where people have either</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.040" end="00:36:03.120" style="s2">reached the next stage of their life so</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.840" end="00:36:04.500" style="s2">there is like a coming-of-age phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.120" end="00:36:07.290" style="s2">where the persons which is their</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.500" end="00:36:09.900" style="s2">cultural context completely or they must</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.290" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">exist in the intermingling of emerging</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:15.120" style="s2">of previously disconnected cultures so</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:19.020" style="s2">either one is providing a bridge into</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.120" end="00:36:22.490" style="s2">them or providing a bridge between two</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.020" end="00:36:29.220" style="s2">separate things that merge right right</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.490" end="00:36:31.410" style="s2">and I think the the process of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.220" end="00:36:33.300" style="s2">crystallization of knowledge where there</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.410" end="00:36:34.920" style="s2">is a lot of knowledge to synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.300" end="00:36:37.740" style="s2">either because of the different life</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.920" end="00:36:41.070" style="s2">experiences of the people or because of</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.740" end="00:36:43.260" style="s2">two separate compartments coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.070" end="00:36:46.110" style="s2">together because there&#39;s a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.260" end="00:36:49.350" style="s2">work available enough people try their</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.110" end="00:36:52.200" style="s2">hands at intellectual synthesis and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.350" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">see each other do that that they acquire</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.200" end="00:36:56.310" style="s2">good taste as to who is doing actual and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:57.990" style="s2">intellectual synthesis and who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.310" end="00:37:00.420" style="s2">something else there has to be an</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.990" end="00:37:02.370" style="s2">abundance almost like a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.420" end="00:37:04.650" style="s2">overhang right there&#39;s this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.370" end="00:37:06.150" style="s2">computational overhang that people have</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.650" end="00:37:07.500" style="s2">used with the idea that you know as</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.150" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">computers grew faster and faster and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.500" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">faster but until there was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:13.290" style="s2">breakthrough theoretical breakthrough in</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:14.760" style="s2">our understanding of intelligence there</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.290" end="00:37:16.710" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be artificial intelligence but</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.760" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">the faster the computers were the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.710" end="00:37:20.460" style="s2">smarter the artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:22.080" style="s2">would be once you figured it out I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.460" end="00:37:23.610" style="s2">there&#39;s something like this with culture</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.080" end="00:37:25.740" style="s2">even if that by the way doesn&#39;t apply to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.610" end="00:37:28.260" style="s2">AI is it actually exists it&#39;s just where</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.740" end="00:37:30.450" style="s2">I got the concept right so so there has</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.260" end="00:37:32.790" style="s2">to be cognitive overhang in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.450" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s this overabundance of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.790" end="00:37:37.320" style="s2">that&#39;s been separated somehow by a wall</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:39.600" style="s2">of experience or communication that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.320" end="00:37:41.880" style="s2">being breached allowing many many people</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.600" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">to participate and enough of the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.880" end="00:37:46.770" style="s2">in the new subculture enough of them are</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:50.010" style="s2">participating for it to be electrical</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.770" end="00:37:51.510" style="s2">activity in that scene that is like one</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.010" end="00:37:54.080" style="s2">of the strongest like a resource</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.510" end="00:37:56.580" style="s2">preconditions I still think it requires</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.080" end="00:37:58.200" style="s2">socialite and requires group norms and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.580" end="00:38:00.690" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.200" end="00:38:02.850" style="s2">and eventually they run they run out of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.690" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">the insight to deposit or they run out</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.850" end="00:38:07.860" style="s2">of socialites mm-hmm so would you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:09.330" style="s2">analogize that to like the economic</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.860" end="00:38:12.420" style="s2">surplus that&#39;s put back into</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.330" end="00:38:14.220" style="s2">productivity yes yes there&#39;s a very like</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.420" end="00:38:17.610" style="s2">a very good analogy they&#39;re very strong</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.220" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">mm-hmm I wish I wish we could just write</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.610" end="00:38:20.970" style="s2">papers and that for econ journalist or</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.440" end="00:38:22.710" style="s2">something like there&#39;s I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.970" end="00:38:25.140" style="s2">there&#39;s material for something like 70</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.710" end="00:38:31.820" style="s2">70 or 80 papers just in the last 30</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.140" end="00:38:39.090" style="s2">minutes of conversation cool Thank You</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.420" end="00:38:49.800" style="s2">on about about like the academic silos</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.820" end="00:38:53.670" style="s2">and lack of like transdisciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.800" end="00:38:56.520" style="s2">thinking and for example you biohacking</p>

<p begin="00:39:05.790" end="00:39:09.840" style="s2">of wellness they&#39;re like they&#39;re coming</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:44.490" style="s2">philosophy and I want circles around</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.230" end="00:39:47.430" style="s2">them when I talk about actually how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.490" end="00:39:51.180" style="s2">live a healthy life and and basically my</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.430" end="00:39:54.090" style="s2">point here is what do you think are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.180" end="00:39:56.430" style="s2">benefits and constraints of navigating</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.090" end="00:39:59.250" style="s2">the current meta crisis through the</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.250" end="00:40:03.420" style="s2">I&#39;m heavily into bio hacking and like</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.740" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">when I think about it I think because</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.420" end="00:40:08.340" style="s2">the thing about games it is acts as in</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:11.070" style="s2">like we are playing something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.340" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">imaginary it&#39;s a myth we do have</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.070" end="00:40:16.200" style="s2">in history of games that we played and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:20.310" style="s2">how we&#39;re trusted changing rules in</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.200" end="00:40:23.430" style="s2">order the missions but I also but me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.310" end="00:40:27.360" style="s2">playing around with with biology as as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.430" end="00:40:29.670" style="s2">framework because like I look at what</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.360" end="00:40:31.830" style="s2">human beings are doing as by becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.670" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">super organism I&#39;ve heard people use</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.830" end="00:40:36.390" style="s2">biological you know like that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:38.280" style="s2">metaphor but I actually see that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.390" end="00:40:41.430" style="s2">literally as what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.280" end="00:40:44.100" style="s2">and I actually see also become the super</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.430" end="00:40:45.750" style="s2">organism as like like like like</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.100" end="00:40:48.900" style="s2">basically what we&#39;re trying to do and my</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.750" end="00:40:52.890" style="s2">point is I believe that biology has like</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.900" end="00:40:56.340" style="s2">countless examples of successfully</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.890" end="00:40:59.580" style="s2">instantiated anty anty robbers games</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.340" end="00:41:01.740" style="s2">like serial endosymbiosis where we</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.580" end="00:41:04.530" style="s2">actually have countless solutions okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.740" end="00:41:06.090" style="s2">solve games like we actually have these</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.530" end="00:41:09.930" style="s2">systems in place I think we just need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.090" end="00:41:12.570" style="s2">tap into the innate knowledge that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.930" end="00:41:15.090" style="s2">embodied within biology so I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.570" end="00:41:17.430" style="s2">what are your thoughts on that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.090" end="00:41:19.350" style="s2">big body too it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot to ask for</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.430" end="00:41:22.230" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly interesting to listen and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.350" end="00:41:23.910" style="s2">think about takes more to evaluate of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.230" end="00:41:25.800" style="s2">course like you know especially it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.910" end="00:41:27.750" style="s2">like lot lots of claims like takes a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.800" end="00:41:30.210" style="s2">while to think them all through I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.750" end="00:41:31.710" style="s2">that there is massive massive overhang</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.210" end="00:41:33.360" style="s2">between different fields of human</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.710" end="00:41:35.310" style="s2">knowledge and there are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.360" end="00:41:38.760" style="s2">artificial divisions between them that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.310" end="00:41:40.920" style="s2">we pretend are inherent divisions you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.760" end="00:41:43.890" style="s2">know my intuition is the human mind is</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.920" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">whole it&#39;s not fragmented it can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.890" end="00:41:49.230" style="s2">fragmented but it&#39;s whole so the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:52.140" style="s2">of knowledge and effective thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.230" end="00:41:54.570" style="s2">whole it&#39;s a single endeavor and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.140" end="00:41:56.550" style="s2">incentives again of the librarian are to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.570" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">narrow it down as much as possible to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.550" end="00:42:00.060" style="s2">create the most defensible minimal index</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.100" style="s2">card which is perhaps good as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.060" end="00:42:03.870" style="s2">preservation technique much as</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.100" end="00:42:07.320" style="s2">mummification is good for the human body</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.870" end="00:42:11.510" style="s2">a to preserve it but it&#39;s not compatible</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.320" end="00:42:13.740" style="s2">with with life perhaps like excessive</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.510" end="00:42:16.830" style="s2">fragmentation is not compatible with</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.740" end="00:42:18.870" style="s2">intellectual life so that&#39;s that will be</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.830" end="00:42:21.510" style="s2">my first reflection on it perhaps could</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.870" end="00:42:23.010" style="s2">go to the next question then and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.510" end="00:42:26.630" style="s2">I can&#39;t really speak on biology right</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.010" end="00:42:29.940" style="s2">it&#39;s not our we have expertise</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.630" end="00:42:33.239" style="s2">great thank you so much okay I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.940" end="00:42:35.460" style="s2">ask a question on behalf of Coleman how</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.239" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">do you think about epistemology when it</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.460" end="00:42:41.509" style="s2">comes to current events where there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:41.509" style="s2">many stories about what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.869" end="00:42:53.969" style="s2">well there&#39;s okay I basically think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.289" end="00:42:56.309" style="s2">people need to to understand current</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.969" end="00:42:58.349" style="s2">events have a well worked out model of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.309" end="00:42:59.910" style="s2">how revolutions work and how they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.349" end="00:43:01.979" style="s2">work they need to have a good model of</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.910" end="00:43:03.869" style="s2">economic production being to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.979" end="00:43:06.420" style="s2">model on the Genesis and functioning of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.869" end="00:43:08.430" style="s2">religions and they probably need to know</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.420" end="00:43:10.859" style="s2">a thing or two about stage formation and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.430" end="00:43:14.329" style="s2">that just handles the politics and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.859" end="00:43:17.249" style="s2">geopolitics there&#39;s like stuff happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.329" end="00:43:20.009" style="s2">technologically and psychologically that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.249" end="00:43:23.150" style="s2">I think is beyond easily accessible</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.009" end="00:43:25.079" style="s2">material so in other words just</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.150" end="00:43:26.549" style="s2">technologically to keep track of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.079" end="00:43:27.900" style="s2">going on you would actually need the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.549" end="00:43:30.450" style="s2">tacit knowledge of like several</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.900" end="00:43:32.190" style="s2">different branches of expertise like</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.450" end="00:43:34.200" style="s2">even to keep track of something basic</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.190" end="00:43:35.819" style="s2">like you know solar cells becoming</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.200" end="00:43:37.619" style="s2">cheaper over time why are they becoming</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.819" end="00:43:40.729" style="s2">cheaper right that already is like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.619" end="00:43:43.109" style="s2">non-trivial technical question and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.729" end="00:43:44.940" style="s2">psychologically I think we you know we</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.109" end="00:43:47.969" style="s2">don&#39;t have canonical theories of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.940" end="00:43:52.739" style="s2">psychology that we deeply rely on but in</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.969" end="00:43:56.819" style="s2">fact everyone practices you know we</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.739" end="00:43:58.619" style="s2">practice so clearly emotional</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.819" end="00:44:00.299" style="s2">transformation and working with other</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.619" end="00:44:01.739" style="s2">people we all do psychological</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.299" end="00:44:03.630" style="s2">engineering all the time everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.739" end="00:44:05.430" style="s2">doing psyops right if you want to frame</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.630" end="00:44:07.529" style="s2">them that way it&#39;s somehow our</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.430" end="00:44:09.960" style="s2">exploitative theory of psychologists are</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.529" end="00:44:11.880" style="s2">primitive so in this way I think human</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.960" end="00:44:13.859" style="s2">beings it&#39;s I think human psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.880" end="00:44:16.710" style="s2">not that complicated but I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.859" end="00:44:20.249" style="s2">kind of birds right birds that know how</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.710" end="00:44:23.249" style="s2">to fly but don&#39;t know how to design a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.249" end="00:44:25.079" style="s2">plane or how to like you know even</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.249" end="00:44:27.989" style="s2">explicate the laws of aerodynamics or</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.079" end="00:44:29.670" style="s2">something like this so I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.989" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">one could have a better theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.670" end="00:44:34.410" style="s2">understanding of psychology one could</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:37.190" style="s2">construct intelligible interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.410" end="00:44:40.069" style="s2">of what is happening with society</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.190" end="00:44:42.200" style="s2">that would overcome the limitations of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.069" end="00:44:44.390" style="s2">our intuitions because our intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.200" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not oriented to a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.390" end="00:44:47.630" style="s2">eighty million voters right or talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:50.270" style="s2">from 20 million voters I forget the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.630" end="00:44:52.579" style="s2">exact number of voters in the US there</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.270" end="00:44:55.130" style="s2">may you know we can deal with two</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.579" end="00:44:57.170" style="s2">hundred people maybe but you would need</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.130" end="00:44:59.510" style="s2">to know things about the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.170" end="00:45:01.430" style="s2">that number of voters or that number of</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.510" end="00:45:02.869" style="s2">citizens to make predictions on some</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.430" end="00:45:04.310" style="s2">things about what&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.869" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">or even not predictions just</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.310" end="00:45:08.569" style="s2">explanations and I guess I am</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:11.450" style="s2">constrained as to correct explanations</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.569" end="00:45:14.630" style="s2">and yes I do believe that it is not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.450" end="00:45:16.369" style="s2">all narrative but there exists like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.630" end="00:45:19.339" style="s2">true fact of the matter there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.369" end="00:45:21.230" style="s2">physical reality there we can&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.339" end="00:45:24.380" style="s2">access it though sometimes it hits us on</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.230" end="00:45:26.060" style="s2">the head I would argue that with COBIT</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.380" end="00:45:28.040" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing is over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.060" end="00:45:32.060" style="s2">the collision of the social narrative</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.040" end="00:45:33.589" style="s2">and the raw biology of the virus and our</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.060" end="00:45:36.380" style="s2">system is not dealing with the raw</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.589" end="00:45:39.260" style="s2">biology of the virus very well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.380" end="00:45:42.440" style="s2">dealing well with physical reality it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.260" end="00:45:44.119" style="s2">very used to salesmanship right and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.440" end="00:45:46.369" style="s2">know America&#39;s been leveling up and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.119" end="00:45:48.140" style="s2">marketing in demagoguery for what 200</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.369" end="00:45:51.619" style="s2">years now so we shouldn&#39;t be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.140" end="00:46:01.579" style="s2">that it&#39;s gotten so so deeply a mesh in</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.619" end="00:46:06.920" style="s2">this MMO yep oh right thank you my would</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.579" end="00:46:10.280" style="s2">you like to ask a question uh yeah can</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.920" end="00:46:13.069" style="s2">you hear me yes okay so I actually have</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.280" end="00:46:16.220" style="s2">a couple of questions but I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.069" end="00:46:19.849" style="s2">distill it down to two through something</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.220" end="00:46:22.010" style="s2">more essential one thing I&#39;m sort of</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.530" end="00:46:28.339" style="s2">allowed to sort of imagine an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.630" end="00:46:31.849" style="s2">situation it&#39;s sort of the ideal</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.790" end="00:46:43.970" style="s2">is kind of stemming from the fact that</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.970" end="00:46:47.420" style="s2">are with sort of what goes on on Wall</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.950" end="00:46:49.310" style="s2">Street Wall Street in different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.420" end="00:46:50.690" style="s2">institutions where there seem to be a</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.010" end="00:47:17.210" style="s2">so that&#39;s just kind of like one thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.230" end="00:47:19.190" style="s2">sort of what is the ideal sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.210" end="00:47:20.890" style="s2">knowledge producing institution what are</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.190" end="00:47:25.670" style="s2">the core principles on which its it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.890" end="00:47:28.550" style="s2">built see I&#39;ll leave it at that and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.670" end="00:47:31.310" style="s2">like to hear thoughts on that I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.550" end="00:47:33.829" style="s2">corporate the corporate structure can be</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.310" end="00:47:35.540" style="s2">compatible with knowledge production the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.829" end="00:47:37.970" style="s2">classic example would just be Rand the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.540" end="00:47:41.150" style="s2">RAND Corporation though arguably that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.970" end="00:47:44.030" style="s2">bootstrapping off of the National</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.150" end="00:47:48.770" style="s2">Defense state as was built in 1940&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.030" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">right military-industrial complex but</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.770" end="00:47:53.359" style="s2">yeah the RAND Corporation produced</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:56.510" style="s2">decent research I think Microsoft is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.359" end="00:47:58.730" style="s2">corporate body produces good research in</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.510" end="00:48:02.150" style="s2">Microsoft&#39;s you know little corner the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.730" end="00:48:04.670" style="s2">labs arguably did the same thing so it</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.150" end="00:48:06.680" style="s2">can be a good spot to do research it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.670" end="00:48:09.160" style="s2">not necessarily the most natural space</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.680" end="00:48:13.670" style="s2">but it solves the problem of creating</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.160" end="00:48:17.869" style="s2">socio-economic Nisha&#39;s right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.670" end="00:48:21.710" style="s2">and it eat at times produces these</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.869" end="00:48:23.660" style="s2">islands of economic abundance so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.710" end="00:48:26.599" style="s2">think the profit motive is actually that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.660" end="00:48:28.970" style="s2">helpful in generating knowledge it can</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.599" end="00:48:31.910" style="s2">be very helpful in generating for</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.970" end="00:48:34.430" style="s2">encouraging practical implementation of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.910" end="00:48:35.869" style="s2">knowledge so I think that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.430" end="00:48:39.790" style="s2">there&#39;s this very subtle distinction</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.869" end="00:48:39.790" style="s2">much as exist between like you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.900" end="00:48:46.010" style="s2">between production of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.300" end="00:48:48.700" style="s2">conservation of knowledge there might</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.010" end="00:48:50.740" style="s2">exist a subtle distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.700" end="00:48:55.339" style="s2">application the production of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.740" end="00:48:56.810" style="s2">now I think that I think if someone is</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.339" end="00:48:59.030" style="s2">claiming to merely produce knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.810" end="00:49:00.950" style="s2">with having no thought as to what</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.030" end="00:49:01.890" style="s2">they&#39;ll be used for I think they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.950" end="00:49:03.990" style="s2">lying</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.890" end="00:49:06.060" style="s2">or rather they are confused about their</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.990" end="00:49:08.520" style="s2">own motivations because I think almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.060" end="00:49:11.340" style="s2">all knowledge production priorities have</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.520" end="00:49:12.510" style="s2">embedded in them right just as Mike you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.340" end="00:49:14.970" style="s2">might have something embedded in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.510" end="00:49:17.820" style="s2">market I think everyone has embedded</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.970" end="00:49:20.310" style="s2">intent and you know what is most</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.820" end="00:49:24.240" style="s2">interesting to them what is joyful what</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.310" end="00:49:25.830" style="s2">is restorative and that this means that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.240" end="00:49:29.160" style="s2">there is like kind of a teleology of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.830" end="00:49:31.110" style="s2">knowledge right cool</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.160" end="00:49:34.230" style="s2">so I hope that then at least answers the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.110" end="00:49:35.850" style="s2">question somewhat well I mean I I kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.230" end="00:49:37.710" style="s2">of I wanted to asked it because I</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.850" end="00:49:39.660" style="s2">figured it would be perhaps somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.710" end="00:49:41.880" style="s2">controversial but I was I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.660" end="00:49:42.900" style="s2">curious to know even in a if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.880" end="00:49:44.130" style="s2">sort of step back from any one</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.900" end="00:49:46.200" style="s2">particular kind of institution or</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.130" end="00:49:47.760" style="s2">corporation or a university just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.200" end="00:49:50.570" style="s2">put those models that exist to the side</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.760" end="00:49:53.160" style="s2">and just kind of think you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.570" end="00:49:55.110" style="s2">ideally what what are the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.160" end="00:49:57.840" style="s2">principles of an institution which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.110" end="00:50:01.410" style="s2">sort of sense of knowledge production</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.840" end="00:50:09.570" style="s2">and distribution yeah I mean you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.410" end="00:50:12.150" style="s2">have a situation that one socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.570" end="00:50:15.600" style="s2">position is not endangered by producing</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.150" end="00:50:18.300" style="s2">by producing excessive knowledge yet it</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.600" end="00:50:20.580" style="s2">is not built up by producing fake</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.300" end="00:50:22.590" style="s2">knowledge so in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.580" end="00:50:25.830" style="s2">disinformation as an incentive has to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.590" end="00:50:28.530" style="s2">very low right in both ways both in</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.830" end="00:50:30.990" style="s2">faking production faking knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.530" end="00:50:35.490" style="s2">faking stuff even when you don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.990" end="00:50:37.470" style="s2">and in the direction of not being</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.490" end="00:50:41.190" style="s2">punished for producing the wrong the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.470" end="00:50:43.080" style="s2">wrong object now again here I will say</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.190" end="00:50:45.300" style="s2">there is something subtly problematic</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.080" end="00:50:47.970" style="s2">with the perspective of academic freedom</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.300" end="00:50:48.930" style="s2">and even freedom of speech they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.970" end="00:50:51.960" style="s2">think we have a good social</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.930" end="00:50:54.570" style="s2">technological solution to I lean in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.960" end="00:50:56.430" style="s2">direction because I don&#39;t have a better</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.570" end="00:50:59.070" style="s2">solution but there is a subtle problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.430" end="00:51:01.020" style="s2">if you take my argument about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.070" end="00:51:03.930" style="s2">implicit embedded intent and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.020" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">production being true then it is valid</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.930" end="00:51:08.810" style="s2">to consider certain kinds of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:11.730" style="s2">production evidence of bad faith action</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.810" end="00:51:13.110" style="s2">so my view right now is like we actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.730" end="00:51:15.900" style="s2">are desperate for knowledge production</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.110" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">so even knowledge produced in bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.900" end="00:51:19.470" style="s2">should be rewarded and should be used</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:22.260" style="s2">but some of it definitely has produced</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.470" end="00:51:23.819" style="s2">uh you know for anti-social reasons</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.260" end="00:51:26.700" style="s2">right and I think this is the real</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.819" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">intuitive you know like sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.700" end="00:51:29.730" style="s2">jock and the nerd right the nerd</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:32.700" style="s2">sometimes has a point though he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.730" end="00:51:35.700" style="s2">gonna put it into words like you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.700" end="00:51:38.910" style="s2">oftentimes the nerd is disdainful of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.700" end="00:51:40.770" style="s2">jock and does look down on them and is</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.910" end="00:51:42.510" style="s2">in fact mean-spirited towards the jock</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.770" end="00:51:45.049" style="s2">they merely don&#39;t have the power to like</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.510" end="00:51:48.210" style="s2">exercise it over them so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.049" end="00:51:49.980" style="s2">sometimes the crackpot is actually ill</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.210" end="00:51:52.470" style="s2">intention towards society and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.980" end="00:51:55.230" style="s2">like the small part of this persecution</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.470" end="00:51:57.420" style="s2">complex that is real right so I started</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.230" end="00:52:00.510" style="s2">by sort of mocking society&#39;s resilient</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.420" end="00:52:01.980" style="s2">societies like firm policing social</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.510" end="00:52:03.690" style="s2">policing between the barrier of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.980" end="00:52:05.849" style="s2">professional thinker and crackpot</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.690" end="00:52:07.589" style="s2">because the reality is people if they</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.849" end="00:52:11.039" style="s2">follow thought will end up on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.589" end="00:52:13.410" style="s2">of the barrier but there is a reason and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.039" end="00:52:16.859" style="s2">there is an interim solution that</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.410" end="00:52:18.210" style="s2">society is adopted right so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.859" end="00:52:20.069" style="s2">really just invent a better social</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.210" end="00:52:22.619" style="s2">technology on the spot I think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.069" end="00:52:25.619" style="s2">would be there are too many things to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.619" end="00:52:27.809" style="s2">factor like there&#39;s um it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.619" end="00:52:30.660" style="s2">honestly the life of a the work of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.809" end="00:52:32.430" style="s2">lifetime in great founder Theory the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.660" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">creation of these new very excellent</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.430" end="00:52:37.740" style="s2">social technologies that solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:40.440" style="s2">of this type is the mechanisms to which</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.740" end="00:52:41.880" style="s2">history is driven forward right more so</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.440" end="00:52:44.309" style="s2">than material production because I feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.880" end="00:52:48.329" style="s2">material production exists and necessary</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.309" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">symbiosis with that so I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.329" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">is uh it&#39;s it&#39;s the work of a lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:54.510" style="s2">it&#39;s the work of genius</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:57.630" style="s2">it&#39;s from now at least I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.510" end="00:53:00.329" style="s2">say that you know I think it is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.630" end="00:53:02.839" style="s2">beyond my like intellectual authority to</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.329" end="00:53:02.839" style="s2">speak on that</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.950" end="00:53:11.570" style="s2">thank you right okay so we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.190" end="00:53:14.300" style="s2">closing in here maybe for our last</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.570" end="00:53:18.680" style="s2">question here she would you like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.300" end="00:53:20.420" style="s2">your question sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.680" end="00:53:22.550" style="s2">so you were talking about like how if</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.420" end="00:53:24.730" style="s2">you had like a hundred million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.550" end="00:53:29.270" style="s2">and fifty people that&#39;s like kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.730" end="00:53:30.950" style="s2">unit of functioning the seemed ideal to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.270" end="00:53:33.410" style="s2">you and I was wondering if you had that</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.950" end="00:53:34.670" style="s2">like access to those resources what</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.410" end="00:53:37.180" style="s2">would you be doing with it</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.670" end="00:53:39.710" style="s2">well I didn&#39;t say I would have it I said</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.180" end="00:53:41.870" style="s2">hypothetical you or like a group right</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.710" end="00:53:50.090" style="s2">so if there was I&#39;m just curious what</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.870" end="00:53:51.860" style="s2">you would utilize those resources well</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.090" end="00:53:54.380" style="s2">there would be several things that would</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.860" end="00:53:57.110" style="s2">be there would be grad school</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.380" end="00:53:58.880" style="s2">credentials but with actual intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.110" end="00:54:00.710" style="s2">excellence you would create a community</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.880" end="00:54:02.420" style="s2">of intellectual excellence that at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.710" end="00:54:04.790" style="s2">end would give people bureaucratically</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.420" end="00:54:09.770" style="s2">legible credentials and there would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.790" end="00:54:12.680" style="s2">also a PR publication machine where they</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.770" end="00:54:14.450" style="s2">would be connected to book deals this</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.680" end="00:54:16.460" style="s2">would give them both public legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.450" end="00:54:20.750" style="s2">and bureaucratically legible legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.460" end="00:54:22.760" style="s2">and the currently tenured would have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.750" end="00:54:24.380" style="s2">argue that the phd&#39;s that they have are</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.760" end="00:54:26.830" style="s2">not real PhDs but they would just</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.380" end="00:54:30.110" style="s2">embarrass themselves over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.830" end="00:54:31.820" style="s2">because the papers and the books and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.110" end="00:54:32.300" style="s2">visible output would just be so much</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.820" end="00:54:33.710" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.300" end="00:54:35.600" style="s2">but eventually they would stop fighting</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.710" end="00:54:37.190" style="s2">it and they would instead try to recruit</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.600" end="00:54:39.650" style="s2">them to become tenured professors at</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.190" end="00:54:42.890" style="s2">Harvard or whatever probably this would</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.650" end="00:54:44.800" style="s2">be a 10 20 year undertaking but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.890" end="00:54:47.870" style="s2">quite doable for that amount of money</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.800" end="00:54:50.300" style="s2">and part of part of it is of course that</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.870" end="00:54:52.490" style="s2">you need about 20 million to I think a</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.300" end="00:54:54.680" style="s2">bribe a second tier College with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.490" end="00:54:56.180" style="s2">promise that if they allow to run this</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.680" end="00:54:57.950" style="s2">grad school they will become a first</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.180" end="00:54:59.960" style="s2">tier college by the time this whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.950" end="00:55:01.460" style="s2">thing is over so that would require a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.960" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">decently ambitious second tier</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.460" end="00:55:06.830" style="s2">university to you know and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:08.180" style="s2">factoring in even if it&#39;s decently in</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.830" end="00:55:13.670" style="s2">victress you still have to bribe them</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.180" end="00:55:15.950" style="s2">with at least 20 million great all right</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.670" end="00:55:18.009" style="s2">so why do you have any final words for</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.950" end="00:55:22.730" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.009" end="00:55:25.519" style="s2">well my works be like I just I would</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.730" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">absolutely love it if people if they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.519" end="00:55:29.539" style="s2">in the pursuit of knowledge if you are a</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:31.279" style="s2">hobbyist you know consider that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.539" end="00:55:33.410" style="s2">you&#39;re just way more serious than the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.279" end="00:55:35.150" style="s2">professionals are because you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.410" end="00:55:37.609" style="s2">actually aiming at the thing itself and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.150" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">if you believe that you as a hobbyist</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.609" end="00:55:40.519" style="s2">are way more serious than the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:42.230" style="s2">professionals are well congratulations</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.519" end="00:55:44.180" style="s2">then you should read my article again</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.230" end="00:55:46.339" style="s2">and you should think about it so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.180" end="00:55:50.690" style="s2">serious and if I&#39;m gonna win how do I</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.339" end="00:55:54.920" style="s2">beat them right like how do I make sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.690" end="00:55:57.049" style="s2">that you know this is in fact going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.920" end="00:55:58.640" style="s2">be taken in by the librarians that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.049" end="00:56:02.599" style="s2">librarians will say this is a valid</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.640" end="00:56:04.220" style="s2">input we accept it and that the public</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.599" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">as a whole can benefit from your</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.220" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">knowledge production because I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:11.299" style="s2">there&#39;s this massive massive need for</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:13.279" style="s2">clearly communicated knowledge that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.299" end="00:56:15.470" style="s2">not playing intelligent signaling games</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.279" end="00:56:17.299" style="s2">do you guys know how like the stock</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.470" end="00:56:19.490" style="s2">market is utterly disconnected from the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.299" end="00:56:21.349" style="s2">physical economy right now well I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.490" end="00:56:23.329" style="s2">the intellectual Authority market is</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.349" end="00:56:25.279" style="s2">like radically disconnected from actual</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.329" end="00:56:27.950" style="s2">intellectual productivity right now I</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.279" end="00:56:29.869" style="s2">think it&#39;s been really inflated for a</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.950" end="00:56:31.670" style="s2">long time I think we&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.869" end="00:56:33.769" style="s2">equivalent of intellectual quantitive</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.670" end="00:56:37.309" style="s2">easing since at least the spotnik moment</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.769" end="00:56:38.990" style="s2">right in the aftermath of Sputnik it</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.309" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">became important for the u.s. to</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.990" end="00:56:43.009" style="s2">mass-produce engineers so it could</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:45.049" style="s2">produce as many engineers as the Soviet</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.049" end="00:56:48.140" style="s2">course the reality is while the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.519" end="00:56:49.880" style="s2">Union had many excellent engineers they</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.140" end="00:56:51.289" style="s2">were lying about the number of</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.880" end="00:56:53.240" style="s2">high-quality engineers they were</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.289" end="00:56:54.769" style="s2">producing just as they were lying about</p>
