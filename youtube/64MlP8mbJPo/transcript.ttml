<p begin="00:00:00.039" end="00:00:02.489" style="s2">Dr.. Jordan Pearson good morning good morning</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.490" end="00:00:09.240" style="s2">Thank you so much for coming in you&#39;re developing this enormous power and reach is it the heavy burden for it?</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.210" end="00:00:15.000" style="s2">Well it it&#39;s heavy and light at the same time. You know it&#39;s it&#39;s constant I</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.119" end="00:00:18.599" style="s2">Don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing day-to-day until that day</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.600" end="00:00:24.569" style="s2">I have people managing my schedule, and I&#39;m busy enough so that I pretty much attend to the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.570" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">But the responsibility of getting into all these heads mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">And you are influencing people&#39;s signa me aren&#39;t you?</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.750" end="00:00:31.170" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.170" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">I guess I take solace in the fact that so many thousands of people now have written to me and also talked to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.370" end="00:00:38.020" style="s2">to say that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.020" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">Things are better for them because they&#39;ve been trying to do some of the things that I suggest in my lectures and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.680" end="00:00:46.539" style="s2">It is a heavy responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.539" end="00:00:52.529" style="s2">When when you have influence of that sort but it lightens it when you also have evidence</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.899" end="00:00:56.128" style="s2">Suggesting that it seems to be doing people a lot of good your changing lives</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.070" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">That seems to be the case.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:00:59.920" style="s2">You&#39;re saving lives?</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.920" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">Saving lives too? Well, I would say there were six people in the audience last night. I was talking in Melbourne</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:10.709" style="s2">I would say there were six, maybe there were more but there were at least six so half a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.709" end="00:01:14.860" style="s2">And they were young men who told me that that that&#39;s that&#39;s what they said</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:16.540" style="s2">That you had served their lives.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.540" end="00:01:18.540" style="s2">Yeah, how do you feel about that?</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.380" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">Breaks me up. Why, it&#39;s a very positive thing you&#39;ve done. What what do you mean it breaks you up?</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.970" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">Well it&#39;s sad that there are so many people in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.049" end="00:01:35.008" style="s2">State of crisis you know and they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.610" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">that much encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.950" end="00:01:40.950" style="s2">That&#39;s the thing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:42.280" style="s2">So,</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.280" end="00:01:48.329" style="s2">It&#39;s sad that it only takes that much encouragement to make that much difference. There&#39;s a lot of lost people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.329" end="00:01:49.400" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:01:49.400" end="00:01:52.360" style="s2">So it&#39;s a good thing to be able to help that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">It&#39;s overwhelming. Well I can tell that you&#39;re very emotional about it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:04.260" style="s2">Yeah, well it&#39;s really something. You know what time I hadn&#39;t thought much about what had happened last night, but you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.980" end="00:02:08.740" style="s2">probably 500 people lined up after the talk and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.100" end="00:02:15.370" style="s2">Most of them say the same thing you know about a quarter of them say look you&#39;re putting into words things</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.370" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">I already knew I always knew but I didn&#39;t know how to say just like oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.710" end="00:02:22.269" style="s2">That&#39;s what archetypal stories do and and I guess that&#39;s what articulate people</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.270" end="00:02:27.429" style="s2">Do you know so that&#39;s a good thing, but then the other 3/4 of them say some variant of?</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:29.930" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.930" end="00:02:31.570" style="s2">You know my life has been turned around</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.570" end="00:02:36.969" style="s2">They say I was addicted or I was drinking too much, or I wasn&#39;t moving ahead my relationship with my girlfriend</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:40.179" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t getting along with my family. I didn&#39;t have any direction in life</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.180" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">I was nihilistic or hopeless or anxious or any number of variants of those and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:49.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to put into practice what you&#39;ve been talking about in your YouTube lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.810" end="00:02:52.520" style="s2">podcasts and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.520" end="00:02:56.350" style="s2">It&#39;s really helped my turn my life around. Thank you. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.140" end="00:02:59.140" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.690" end="00:03:01.989" style="s2">Do something you feel fragile about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:06.340" style="s2">Well</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.970" end="00:03:12.489" style="s2">No, I wouldn&#39;t say exactly that um I seem to be able to handle this</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.489" end="00:03:18.189" style="s2">It&#39;s been going on a long time now. It&#39;s it&#39;s been 18 months, and I would say in many ways now</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.190" end="00:03:20.589" style="s2">It&#39;s better than it was because at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.110" end="00:03:24.429" style="s2">Especially when I got when I put my hat in the political ring</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.430" end="00:03:28.510" style="s2">Let&#39;s say because I felt that the Canadian politicians had overstepped their boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.019" end="00:03:32.289" style="s2">You know my job was threatened and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.989" end="00:03:37.029" style="s2">quite severely, and I thought I might lose my clinical license as well and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.720" end="00:03:39.720" style="s2">Things were up in the air in a big way.  This was over the gender pronoun usage.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.920" end="00:03:46.060" style="s2">Yeah was my refusal when I stated refusal to abide by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.600" end="00:03:48.660" style="s2">by the requirement that that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:51.369" style="s2">modified my language in a certain manner that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.950" end="00:03:53.950" style="s2">Felt was you know appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.130" end="00:03:59.469" style="s2">oh<br />I felt it was inappropriate of the government to demand that I modify my language the government has no right to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.900" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">Intrude on people&#39;s lives to that degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:09.310" style="s2">It&#39;s very very dangerous when that happens and so anyways there was I&#39;ve been in one scandal after another in Canada like seriously like</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:16.540" style="s2">Non-stop for 18 months the last one. Just two days ago. I was at Queen&#39;s University in Kingston, and there was a big</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.140" end="00:04:19.140" style="s2">Demonstration there was a very eerie</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.420" end="00:04:25.140" style="s2">Occurrence they arrested a woman who was carrying a garrote for God&#39;s sake you know.  Does that frighten you?</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.760" end="00:04:30.980" style="s2">That was not good, the Queen&#39;s University thing was not good. We were in a hall. It was kind of like a church this</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.980" end="00:04:34.069" style="s2">this Hall. It&#39;s what it looked like it was lined with stained glass windows and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">probably 20 of them and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.500" end="00:04:41.119" style="s2">Protester had climbed up in the window well of all 20 windows</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.430" end="00:04:46.159" style="s2">probably five or six feet off the ground and there were seven feet high these windows and they were pounding on them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.470" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">Forcefully forcefully enough in one case to break the window and so there was 900 of us inside</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:58.939" style="s2">and it was we were surrounded by this group that were pounding on the windows and yelling and pounding on the doors and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.090" end="00:05:05.480" style="s2">It was and you know you could see against the stained glass you could see these shadowy forms pounding away</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.480" end="00:05:10.640" style="s2">And it was it was very eerie. No one and no one in that Hall will ever forget that experience.  Why?</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:16.490" style="s2">Why were they trying to get in why the garotte, why the, it sounds like hate is it hate?</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.130" end="00:05:19.429" style="s2">Some of it was hate for sure. Why, why do they hate you?</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.670" end="00:05:25.369" style="s2">Because they because of who they imagine I might be I guess that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.280" end="00:05:30.710" style="s2">You know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to hate someone who&#39;s been caricatured and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.260" end="00:05:34.520" style="s2">So, but there&#39;s more to it than that I have been very</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.430" end="00:05:39.590" style="s2">Forceful. Let&#39;s say and my criticisms of the radical left not only in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.590" end="00:05:46.249" style="s2">But in the West in general not critical enough in my estimation, so I hold no stock whatsoever for the radical leftist</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.250" end="00:05:50.029" style="s2">I&#39;m absolutely appalled that they&#39;re the force they are in the universities</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.030" end="00:05:55.730" style="s2">and I do believe that in many ways the universities have done more harm in society than good over the last 20 years and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.860" end="00:06:01.969" style="s2">I say that you know with a fair bit of regret because I&#39;ve been obviously associated with universities since 1993</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.970" end="00:06:08.029" style="s2">But that, it&#39;s a really interesting thing, I sometimes enjoy dealing with the radical lift in the university so I think you&#39;re gonna grow up</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.250" end="00:06:13.460" style="s2">You&#39;re going to get through this and I enjoy the the challenge and the drama and the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.460" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">It&#39;s a challenge of youth saying you&#39;re wrong well</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.640" end="00:06:22.189" style="s2">I&#39;m right, and I know I&#39;m right because I&#39;m 20 and I know everything it&#39;s not the students so much. I&#39;m concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.740" end="00:06:26.990" style="s2">Staff is it. Oh, yeah, it&#39;s the staff and the administrators, and no it&#39;s not the students</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.990" end="00:06:34.970" style="s2">I mean look I&#39;ve been protested against I watched the protesters and most of the time the vast majority of them are young people whose</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:36.840" style="s2">Whose?</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.840" end="00:06:39.619" style="s2">Desire to have a positive influence in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:46.940" style="s2">Channeled into this particular political expression at the moment, but so many of them are manipulated by the faculty members hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.940" end="00:06:52.969" style="s2">And there&#39;s no excuse for that and what they&#39;re doing is is far more dangerous than it looks why do young men?</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.760" end="00:06:55.760" style="s2">need you</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:07:00.829" style="s2">Well first of all you know, it&#39;s not I would say it&#39;s not just young men part of that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:04.310" style="s2">Artifact of the fact that most of the people who watch YouTube are young men?</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.070" end="00:07:08.749" style="s2">but but I won&#39;t evade the question I mean because</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.660" end="00:07:11.580" style="s2">See to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.580" end="00:07:17.150" style="s2">Maturation among men is a voluntary process. It&#39;s not so voluntary for women. They have to grow up fast</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.150" end="00:07:22.220" style="s2">They have a lot of things to do before they hit 30 yeah with men it can it can take longer</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.220" end="00:07:23.910" style="s2">And they need a call to adventure</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.910" end="00:07:26.809" style="s2">Let&#39;s say, and they need a call to responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.810" end="00:07:31.310" style="s2">And they need to be they need to to be initiated into</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.710" end="00:07:34.700" style="s2">Responsibility and to have a case made for its utility</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.700" end="00:07:39.319" style="s2">And so I&#39;m saying look it&#39;s better to be adult than to be a child. It&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.419" end="00:07:41.419" style="s2">It&#39;s better to be in control of your own destiny</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.730" end="00:07:46.609" style="s2">There&#39;s a place for you in the world the world would be lesser if you don&#39;t take your place in it</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.180" end="00:07:53.220" style="s2">That you have a responsibility to bear to sort out your education to straighten out your life and to become who you are</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.740" end="00:07:57.020" style="s2">Grow the hell up don&#39;t grow up and and for reasons that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.220" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">Positive for you positive for your family positive for everyone, so is but is this generation lost</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.610" end="00:08:08.300" style="s2">They desperate they&#39;re clinging to what you&#39;re saying and doing in a desperate. I&#39;m not criticizing what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.300" end="00:08:10.300" style="s2">I&#39;m doing, but they need it. They need it desperately</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.590" end="00:08:16.340" style="s2">why why they think I think that I think that every generation needs a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.830" end="00:08:19.609" style="s2">Message that that that supports</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.820" end="00:08:22.729" style="s2">maturation and and responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.729" end="00:08:30.439" style="s2">I think that we&#39;ve done a bad job as a culture of putting that message forward so to me since the mid-1960s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.990" end="00:08:38.750" style="s2">Our young people have been fed a never ending diet of rights and impulsive freedoms something like that and that leaves a hole</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.240" end="00:08:41.479" style="s2">because most of the meaning that people</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.300" end="00:08:43.969" style="s2">people manage in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.969" end="00:08:48.919" style="s2">And so that would be the meaning that you can offset against the tragedy of life that comes from adopting</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.380" end="00:08:55.309" style="s2">Responsibility and carrying a load like human beings in some sense our design for a load and the heavier the load the better</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.500" end="00:08:57.500" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s one of the things that gives you</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.260" end="00:09:04.760" style="s2">You know there&#39;s this this proclivity among psychologists to attempt to facilitate self-esteem which is a word</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.760" end="00:09:08.900" style="s2">I don&#39;t care much for I think that self-respect is a much better term</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.900" end="00:09:15.049" style="s2">And I think you develop self-respect by carrying a responsibility I feel very lucky to be born in this country</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.050" end="00:09:19.160" style="s2">I think it&#39;s essentially a decent country does follow a lot of what happens in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.160" end="00:09:23.269" style="s2">I&#39;ll get to that in a moment, but I was talking to some welfare workers police Salvation</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.270" end="00:09:25.190" style="s2">Army yesterday saying to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.190" end="00:09:29.510" style="s2">They think society is becoming and and particularly the younger the age group</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.510" end="00:09:34.040" style="s2">We&#39;re talking is becoming more aggressive more cynical more angry</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.380" end="00:09:36.799" style="s2">Do you agree with that and if so why well?</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:44.120" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the statistics bear that out because what we&#39;ve seen over all over the last especially the last 20 years is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.400" end="00:09:46.429" style="s2">remarkable decline in violent crime I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.830" end="00:09:54.109" style="s2">do think that there might be an epidemic more of aimlessness and and and depression and anxiety that sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:09:59.809" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s partly because the case for growing up is not made well</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:07.100" style="s2">And and and because we&#39;re also so cynical about our own societies. You know I was in Amsterdam month ago talking to a group of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:08.900" style="s2">well-placed intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.900" end="00:10:14.479" style="s2">They&#39;re all friends of Theo van Gogh who was who was killed in in in Amsterdam about 15 years ago was stabbed</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.820" end="00:10:19.970" style="s2">And there they said that embarrassment about the Dutch culture is rampant in their society</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.970" end="00:10:20.520" style="s2">and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.520" end="00:10:26.210" style="s2">That just makes my jaw drop because I go to Holland and I think my god this is such an amazing place these people they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.440" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">Scrape this country out of the bottom of the ocean they built dikes to hold back the waves. It&#39;s it&#39;s free. It&#39;s it&#39;s liberal</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:39.540" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s compassionate its orderly. It&#39;s beautiful. Yet they&#39;re embarrassed by it. They&#39;re embarrassed by it because of its</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.040" end="00:10:44.120" style="s2">Tyrannical patriarchal nature, it&#39;s like well. Who are you comparing it to it&#39;s like?</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:51.260" style="s2">What are we comparing our societies to where do you want to live it on on the planet or in time anywhere?</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.260" end="00:10:56.179" style="s2">But in the West not if you have any sense you think you&#39;ve sort of been described as a warrior</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.460" end="00:10:58.460" style="s2">Against political correctness is that fit?</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.920" end="00:10:59.940" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.940" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">Tell me about this in our national carrier Qantas. Got some attention early this week and I was thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">I knew you were coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.190" end="00:11:10.489" style="s2">Taking advice from a diversity group. That&#39;s that&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:15.979" style="s2">And I wanted to ban words like guys and chairmen husband and wife</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.850" end="00:11:21.710" style="s2">Replaceable replace words like mankind and chairman. What&#39;s your reaction to that?</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.860" end="00:11:25.789" style="s2">I think that it would be better if people tried to solve some real problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.880" end="00:11:30.439" style="s2">Instead of playing these idiot diversity games. I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.380" end="00:11:35.270" style="s2">Everyone who plays identity politics whether they play it on the right or the left is</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.340" end="00:11:38.719" style="s2">is going to pay for it in ways they can hardly imagine. It&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:42.080" style="s2">Counterproductive way of dividing up the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.180" end="00:11:43.500" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.500" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">Impossible to come to a peaceful solution in the identity politics universe even the identity politics types themselves they&#39;ve run into this problem they call</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.020" end="00:11:57.349" style="s2">Intersectionality right so ok so you classify people by race and by sex let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.050" end="00:12:05.810" style="s2">So and and seek for equity along those dimensions, but then well what about the intersection between those dimensions?</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.810" end="00:12:07.810" style="s2">So you you have enough?</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.280" end="00:12:17.209" style="s2">Ethnic minorities in your in your organization, let&#39;s say you match by population which is a foolish way of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.210" end="00:12:20.239" style="s2">But you do that and maybe you&#39;re matched by sex</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:27.080" style="s2">But then what about the intersection between race and sex well then what about the intersection between race sex ethnicity?</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.870" end="00:12:33.140" style="s2">Then you could add social class to that then you could add social proclivity then you could add attractiveness</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.260" end="00:12:40.849" style="s2">There&#39;s never-ending way of dividing people up into groups, and you can&#39;t equalize across all those ways. It&#39;s just technically not possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.850" end="00:12:45.830" style="s2">Do you think people need to make a stand on issues like this and when an airline like Qantas makes these?</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.930" end="00:12:50.180" style="s2">decisions do they need to stand against it do they need to boycott it and to do that sort of thing I</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:52.969" style="s2">I think they need to understand it at a deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.970" end="00:12:55.130" style="s2">It&#39;s like we have to decide if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.350" end="00:13:00.500" style="s2">Divide people up if we think that dividing people up primarily by their group identity is a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.500" end="00:13:03.830" style="s2">And it&#39;s not it&#39;s a bad idea it will lead to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.950" end="00:13:07.879" style="s2">an enhancement of our tribal proclivities</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.880" end="00:13:14.089" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that if you&#39;re a an advocate of peace that you would push and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.150" end="00:13:16.650" style="s2">advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.650" end="00:13:23.119" style="s2">Ours further division into tribal entities. It&#39;s a it&#39;s not wise is this transient when we move through this</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.910" end="00:13:28.910" style="s2">We&#39;ll see it&#39;s been not transient in the past. It&#39;s caused tremendous troubles in the past</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.980" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">This is another reason why I&#39;m not a fan of the radical leftists, so</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.080" end="00:13:39.290" style="s2">The the radical left ideologies were were murderous in their expression throughout the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.290" end="00:13:44.680" style="s2">I mentioned earlier this country follows a lot of the US trends good and bad...Like Canada...We&#39;re a little bit behind, but it can be fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.500" end="00:13:47.300" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.310" end="00:13:51.049" style="s2">What do we need to be alert to what do we need to be aware of what we need to avoid?</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.260" end="00:13:53.970" style="s2">We need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.970" end="00:13:58.459" style="s2">We need to be alert to the benefits of the societies that we now inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.120" end="00:14:06.889" style="s2">We need to be grateful for their existence and and note very carefully the unlikelihood of their continued success</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:11.300" style="s2">No, I don&#39;t understand. How we managed it</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:18.769" style="s2">In the West we have societies where the default assumption between human beings is trust. I do not understand. How we manage that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:20.459" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.459" end="00:14:24.529" style="s2">There&#39;s so many ways that you can be betrayed by someone especially if you don&#39;t know them</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.529" end="00:14:29.208" style="s2">How do you set up a society where the typical interaction between strangers is straight? Oh?</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.880" end="00:14:35.390" style="s2">How many societies in the world are like that like 30 40 something like that how did that ever happen?</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.060" end="00:14:41.899" style="s2">We don&#39;t know and it&#39;s an ongoing miracle, and we should do everything we can not to disrupt it because the alternative to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.870" end="00:14:50.390" style="s2">Generous trust that courageous trust, which is unbelievably productive is ruled by thug, and that&#39;s the rule in most of the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.269" end="00:14:53.659" style="s2">So do  you have optimism or not for the future?</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.300" end="00:14:57.769" style="s2">I think we&#39;re in a time of extreme chaos</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.410" end="00:15:03.589" style="s2">Things could go unbelievably well if we were careful. There&#39;s so many good things going on in the world right now</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.630" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">they&#39;re almost miraculous so for example between the year 2000 and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.069" end="00:15:11.659" style="s2">2012 the level of absolute poverty in the world was cut by 50%</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:15.709" style="s2">That was the fastest rate of improvement by a large margin in human history</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.709" end="00:15:19.489" style="s2">It was three years faster than the most optimistic projections had suggested</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.860" end="00:15:23.240" style="s2">There&#39;s hundreds of thousands of people a week now being being</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.490" end="00:15:31.339" style="s2">Pulled into the electrical power grid almost everyone has access to almost infinite computational power and all the educational resources that go along with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.560" end="00:15:36.890" style="s2">We&#39;re wiping out most transmissible diseases the fastest growing economies in the world are in sub-saharan</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.170" end="00:15:40.670" style="s2">Africa like there are a lot of things. There&#39;s no starvation in China</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:45.079" style="s2">There&#39;s a huge middle class in China and India these things are absolutely miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.420" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">So and and god only knows what we could accomplish if we got our act together in the next 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.460" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">You know the sky&#39;s the limit</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:58.909" style="s2">So, but we&#39;re playing very foolish games in the West and we could bring the house down around us, so we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.490" end="00:16:01.940" style="s2">Thank you so much for coming in good luck with the burden oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.270" end="00:16:09.650" style="s2">Thanks very much for the invitation and for the interview Jordan B. Peterson 12 rules for life an antidote to chaos</p>
