<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">as we go through the Western wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:53.340" style="s2">tradition I want to also recommend this</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">book by Pierre hadou what is ancient</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">philosophy so this is a book to study so</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:00.259" style="s2">that you can get a little bit this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">very accessible beautifully written book</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.259" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">that really emphasizes the wind that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:08.069" style="s2">ancient Western philosophy Greek</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:11.009" style="s2">philosophy especially was about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.069" end="00:02:12.930" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.009" end="00:02:13.730" style="s2">excellent supplement and it will provide</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.930" end="00:02:16.459" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.730" end="00:02:19.879" style="s2">useful and important background for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.459" end="00:02:22.610" style="s2">course the wisdom of Hypatia a reminder</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.879" end="00:02:24.230" style="s2">again the that what we&#39;re doing here is</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.610" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to be doing all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.230" end="00:02:30.410" style="s2">these practices right that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:33.170" style="s2">point the point is to give you an</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.410" end="00:02:35.090" style="s2">educated exposure and then can you</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:36.970" style="s2">design principles we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.090" end="00:02:39.530" style="s2">those principles of complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.970" end="00:02:42.410" style="s2">principles of layering principles of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.530" end="00:02:46.790" style="s2">linking and the general areas in which</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.410" end="00:02:50.859" style="s2">you want to have developed practices and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.790" end="00:02:55.069" style="s2">then we want to draw on these two major</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.859" end="00:02:57.230" style="s2">streams each has variation within it the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.069" end="00:02:59.660" style="s2">Western stream that has its variations</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.230" end="00:03:01.970" style="s2">between you know Platonism Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.660" end="00:03:03.890" style="s2">ISM and stoicism and Epicureanism and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.970" end="00:03:05.359" style="s2">the UH platonism of course the Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.890" end="00:03:08.720" style="s2">tradition that has various forms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.359" end="00:03:12.140" style="s2">Buddhism and Taoism and Vedanta and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:15.079" style="s2">Confucianism so you want to draw alright</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.140" end="00:03:18.169" style="s2">on both of these as much as we can so</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.079" end="00:03:21.970" style="s2">that we have a principled pluralism in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.169" end="00:03:24.620" style="s2">an ecology of practices all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.970" end="00:03:26.660" style="s2">think that&#39;s all the announcements we</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.620" end="00:03:29.660" style="s2">need to make we&#39;re going to do a regular</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.660" end="00:03:32.269" style="s2">sitting today normally we have a heart</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.540" end="00:03:40.639" style="s2">compensation we will have a harder</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.549" end="00:03:42.250" style="s2">tomorrow right at ten so we will try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.639" end="00:03:45.650" style="s2">answer a few more questions today so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.250" end="00:03:48.650" style="s2">please get yourself in your basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.650" end="00:03:51.500" style="s2">posture set your phones to do not</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.399" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">philosophy by Pierre hadou as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.309" end="00:21:21.190" style="s2">you get this book you could begin</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:24.580" style="s2">reading it so we have one question today</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.190" end="00:21:26.440" style="s2">so far from Lawrence fulvic I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.580" end="00:21:28.119" style="s2">started to write notes after doing let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.440" end="00:21:29.590" style="s2">see a Davina on particular thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.119" end="00:21:30.999" style="s2">insights that may come to me is this a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.590" end="00:21:32.830" style="s2">good idea and would it be considered</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.999" end="00:21:35.100" style="s2">part of watering my Buddha it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.830" end="00:21:39.369" style="s2">idea and that&#39;s exactly what it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.100" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">sorry I don&#39;t have a really you know</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.029" end="00:22:00.789" style="s2">right relationship to this it right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.309" end="00:22:04.570" style="s2">that the Buddha isn&#39;t a possession it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.789" end="00:22:10.210" style="s2">not something you have something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.570" end="00:22:13.119" style="s2">becoming it is right to be aspired to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.210" end="00:22:14.590" style="s2">within the being mode so as long as</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.119" end="00:22:18.490" style="s2">you&#39;re framing it that way I think</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.749" end="00:22:54.879" style="s2">manual post I&#39;ve got a tendency to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.179" end="00:22:58.179" style="s2">tense over time while meditating any</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.879" end="00:23:01.179" style="s2">tips so there might be a few things</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.690" end="00:23:12.450" style="s2">you may be you may want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.630" end="00:23:14.610" style="s2">somebody about some potential background</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.450" end="00:23:19.620" style="s2">anxiety you have it may be that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.610" end="00:23:23.370" style="s2">trying too hard and so the right effort</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.620" end="00:23:26.430" style="s2">is not there it&#39;s very much right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:28.230" style="s2">why that&#39;s why these are the practices</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.430" end="00:23:30.120" style="s2">and remember when we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.230" end="00:23:32.820" style="s2">standing practices like when we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.120" end="00:23:36.810" style="s2">the Gen John or when we&#39;re doing the</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.860" end="00:23:48.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not tense and you could practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.570" style="s2">getting hung in your body and you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.810" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">think about that in connection to that</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.800" end="00:24:13.050" style="s2">getting tense first you can direct meta</p>
