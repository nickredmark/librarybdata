<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:34.170" style="s2">free as possible but we got into some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.520" end="00:00:37.170" style="s2">the nitty-gritty of how we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.170" end="00:00:41.100" style="s2">potentially give a naturalistic</p>

<p begin="00:00:56.329" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">insight and a lot of the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:06.020" style="s2">and I&#39;m it was even arguing a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.020" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">consciousness and that gives us right</p>

<p begin="00:02:10.619" end="00:02:17.550" style="s2">of the stuff that Heidegger was talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.330" end="00:02:20.910" style="s2">about when he was trying to get us back</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.550" end="00:02:23.460" style="s2">to this primordial sense of meaning in</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.330" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s gather what we&#39;ve done okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.030" end="00:03:09.060" style="s2">so we had problem solving right and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">went over this again in more detail last</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:15.590" style="s2">time we have insight categorization all</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:18.960" style="s2">of these things seem to be per</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.590" end="00:03:27.020" style="s2">demonstrative reference that&#39;s the fin</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.960" end="00:03:32.550" style="s2">sting and we we put that within right</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.020" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">the salience landscaping consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.550" end="00:03:40.410" style="s2">and closely tied to it working memory</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">and then of course tied to that of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.410" end="00:03:49.290" style="s2">course is G right got inference that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:55.400" style="s2">stuff with journey AK we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.290" end="00:03:55.400" style="s2">communication all of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.260" end="00:04:08.069" style="s2">right it&#39;s feeding into relevance</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.209" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">realization we could give a naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.069" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">structural functional organization of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:14.310" style="s2">in terms of self-organizing criticality</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:16.889" style="s2">and small world networks where these are</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.310" end="00:04:20.340" style="s2">understood to mean families of processes</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.889" end="00:04:25.770" style="s2">right and these are deeply related</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.340" end="00:04:32.810" style="s2">together and as I&#39;ve said we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.770" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">got that this is inherently transgender</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.810" end="00:04:41.100" style="s2">even sorry evolving involving that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get with caring and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.100" end="00:04:46.350" style="s2">participation and how right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:48.270" style="s2">the know-how is grounded in the</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.150" end="00:05:20.150" style="s2">in communication for example alright</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve already given you an argument about</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.150" end="00:05:31.350" style="s2">how via complexification alright this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:35.390" style="s2">gives us an account of our capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.350" end="00:05:37.770" style="s2">self transcendence a capacity to produce</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.390" end="00:05:40.380" style="s2">emergent functions and we saw that even</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.770" end="00:05:43.110" style="s2">connected with insight and we can see</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.380" end="00:05:45.900" style="s2">that at work directly out of this now</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:47.490" style="s2">well why why self transcendence the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.900" end="00:05:50.340" style="s2">capacity for self transcendence to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.490" end="00:05:54.410" style="s2">overcoming self-deception is actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.340" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">endemic to your meaning making machinery</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.410" end="00:06:00.480" style="s2">ok in connection with that of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:03.030" style="s2">this would also explain these two are</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.480" end="00:06:06.620" style="s2">related your tremendous capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.030" end="00:06:10.500" style="s2">self-deception for bullshitting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.620" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">right because this has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.500" end="00:06:20.670" style="s2">ultimately your procedure right your</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:24.810" style="s2">salience landscaping etc as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.670" end="00:06:28.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of here that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.810" end="00:06:32.970" style="s2">connectedness that&#39;s so central to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.520" end="00:06:36.390" style="s2">people&#39;s sense of meaning in life being</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.970" end="00:06:40.860" style="s2">connected to something that right is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.390" end="00:06:42.840" style="s2">some sense greater than them other than</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.860" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">them in an important way but to whom</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.840" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">their identity is nevertheless coupled</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.350" end="00:06:58.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to show you how it gives us a</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.870" end="00:07:01.550" style="s2">nice account of respectable knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.100" end="00:07:01.550" style="s2">participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.400" end="00:07:11.070" style="s2">and then how these two can come together</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.070" end="00:07:14.970" style="s2">in procedural noise talk a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.070" end="00:07:16.530" style="s2">about that but the creating of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.970" end="00:07:19.530" style="s2">affordances we&#39;ve talked multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.530" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">how affordances are the Ovation of a</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:25.290" style="s2">within which my skills my capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.639" end="00:07:32.490" style="s2">solve problems can be reliably trained</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.290" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">and developed okay talked about again</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.490" end="00:07:37.590" style="s2">like I said that this has an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:42.389" style="s2">deep carrying in it so you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.590" end="00:07:44.490" style="s2">find the sense of significance here this</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.389" end="00:07:47.700" style="s2">is something you care about you bind</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.490" end="00:07:51.900" style="s2">yourself soon you commit yourself to in</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.700" end="00:07:54.810" style="s2">a very important way I already suggested</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.900" end="00:07:56.970" style="s2">and I try to give to you that with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.810" end="00:08:00.060" style="s2">account last time of insight how this</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.970" end="00:08:01.350" style="s2">can help explain what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.060" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">altered states of consciousness while</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.350" end="00:08:05.669" style="s2">you&#39;re getting both a change in your</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.669" end="00:08:09.479" style="s2">relevance realization machinery how it</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.740" end="00:08:12.020" style="s2">can be altering your optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.479" end="00:08:15.000" style="s2">optimal gripping is also a case of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.020" end="00:08:16.169" style="s2">optimization that fits within this help</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.000" end="00:08:23.570" style="s2">to explain our higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.169" end="00:08:23.570" style="s2">consciousness right now I want to start</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.139" end="00:08:34.890" style="s2">pointing out some other aspects of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.510" end="00:08:36.419" style="s2">that I think contribute to it being how</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.890" end="00:08:39.659" style="s2">do I want to say this represented</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.419" end="00:08:43.020" style="s2">understood grasped as spiritual in</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.659" end="00:08:45.209" style="s2">nature let&#39;s take a look at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.020" end="00:08:50.850" style="s2">features of relevance realization that</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.209" end="00:08:52.740" style="s2">have come out of this argument so these</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.850" end="00:08:55.560" style="s2">are all going to be ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.740" end="00:09:00.170" style="s2">experience this as our fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.560" end="00:09:03.029" style="s2">framing of reality but and again but</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.170" end="00:09:05.550" style="s2">that&#39;s good but it has a sense of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.029" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">standing outside we&#39;re inside the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.550" end="00:09:12.180" style="s2">framing we are participating in it okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">it has to do with right the framing is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.180" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">right at the level of the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:18.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not just looking out its the</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.910" end="00:09:23.710" style="s2">relationship okay but I want to point</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.710" end="00:09:27.640" style="s2">of this what I would argue this is a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.140" end="00:09:29.650" style="s2">of interpreting what Heidegger means by</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.640" end="00:09:31.210" style="s2">the prime or geology of what he was</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.650" end="00:09:33.010" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.210" end="00:09:34.540" style="s2">I saw his Heidegger later have</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.010" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">criticisms of him but I&#39;m also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.540" end="00:09:42.970" style="s2">point out how this work which seems so</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">technical in some sense can be connected</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.970" end="00:09:51.640" style="s2">to some very well deeply existential and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:54.400" style="s2">phenomenological philosophy ok so first</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.640" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">of all the fundamental fundamental &#39;ti</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.400" end="00:10:05.050" style="s2">of this ok so notice that this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:09.160" style="s2">ultimately pre-conceptual in nature it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.050" end="00:10:11.770" style="s2">has to be right because it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.160" end="00:10:15.300" style="s2">level it&#39;s below your level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.770" end="00:10:17.890" style="s2">propositional processing in order to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.300" end="00:10:19.660" style="s2">write in order to have concepts you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.890" end="00:10:20.830" style="s2">to categorize in order to categorize you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.660" end="00:10:22.450" style="s2">have to have demonstrative reference</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.830" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">sorry in order to categorize you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.450" end="00:10:25.510" style="s2">have relevance realization also in order</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:26.920" style="s2">to categorize you have to have first</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.510" end="00:10:28.780" style="s2">have demonstrative reference which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.920" end="00:10:31.090" style="s2">pure pre-conceptual relevance</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.780" end="00:10:38.260" style="s2">realization so this is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.090" end="00:10:41.220" style="s2">pre-conceptual in a deep way ok and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.260" end="00:10:45.330" style="s2">that important sense right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.220" end="00:10:49.930" style="s2">ultimately pre propositional pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.330" end="00:10:53.410" style="s2">propositional if what we mean by belief</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.930" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s often what we mean by belief is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.410" end="00:10:59.110" style="s2">the assertion of propositions and their</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:02.740" style="s2">implications then relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.110" end="00:11:07.810" style="s2">is taking place at a level fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.740" end="00:11:09.190" style="s2">deeper than the level of belief now you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.810" end="00:11:10.780" style="s2">understand that I&#39;m not proposing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.190" end="00:11:13.210" style="s2">this is just a bottom-up process of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.780" end="00:11:15.460" style="s2">course how we conceptualize things and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.210" end="00:11:17.650" style="s2">how we have beliefs about things feeds</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.460" end="00:11:23.670" style="s2">back down that&#39;s why all those diagrams</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.650" end="00:11:26.770" style="s2">have feedback down arrows in them but</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.670" end="00:11:30.280" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about belief ultimately as</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.770" end="00:11:31.870" style="s2">an effect it feeds back and effects but</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.280" end="00:11:35.260" style="s2">it is ultimately of an effect</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.870" end="00:11:37.630" style="s2">of relevance realization because of</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.630" end="00:11:45.790" style="s2">is pre inferential in a deep way because</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.790" end="00:11:50.590" style="s2">means you could I learn this from other</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.980" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">people well no you can&#39;t there&#39;s a sense</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:56.940" style="s2">people but you can&#39;t ultimately learn it</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.310" end="00:12:02.080" style="s2">from other people because learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.940" end="00:12:05.710" style="s2">presupposes it being able to pay</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.080" end="00:12:07.720" style="s2">attention to your mother and pick up on</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.990" end="00:15:23.300" style="s2">out putting all of this together notice</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.410" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">notice how much this points to aspects</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.940" end="00:26:31.460" style="s2">with this but I don&#39;t think is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.520" end="00:26:35.900" style="s2">secular is the the masterful work by</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.900" end="00:26:43.280" style="s2">wonder it&#39;s just a fantastic book and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.260" end="00:26:44.840" style="s2">also argues how central wonder is now</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.280" end="00:26:47.510" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting he does two things</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.840" end="00:26:49.640" style="s2">that align with this so well and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.510" end="00:26:51.140" style="s2">highly recommend this book he argued</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.640" end="00:26:53.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s a book from you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.140" end="00:26:56.539" style="s2">emotion to spirituality and what he</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.720" end="00:26:59.030" style="s2">argues what fuller argues is that of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.539" end="00:27:02.330" style="s2">course wonder is responsible for some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.030" end="00:27:04.100" style="s2">our deepest spiritual experiences our</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.330" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">deepest experiences of what I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.100" end="00:27:12.350" style="s2">religio but he does that by precisely</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:15.860" style="s2">explaining the fundamental functionality</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.350" end="00:27:18.049" style="s2">of things like wonder see wonder wonder</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.860" end="00:27:20.110" style="s2">is basically in the being mode where</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.049" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">curiosity is in the having mode in</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.110" end="00:27:25.280" style="s2">curiosity right now I&#39;m using these</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">terms in their prototypical senses we</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.280" end="00:27:28.970" style="s2">use these terms in very slippery</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:30.590" style="s2">fashions so I&#39;m not claiming that every</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.970" end="00:27:31.970" style="s2">time we use the word wonder every time</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.590" end="00:27:33.320" style="s2">we use the word curiosity but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.970" end="00:27:36.830" style="s2">talking about the kind of wonder that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.320" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">can overlap very readily and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.830" end="00:27:40.370" style="s2">prototypically with awe and I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:43.309" style="s2">about the kind of curiosity that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.370" end="00:27:45.620" style="s2">overlaps prototypically with our solving</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.309" end="00:27:47.659" style="s2">our problems and our manipulating the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.620" end="00:27:51.559" style="s2">world in a way that we find powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.659" end="00:27:52.909" style="s2">efficacious see an inch again remember</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.559" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">what I said and it&#39;s not that one mode</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.909" end="00:27:56.059" style="s2">is good in the other modes bad but</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:58.789" style="s2">you&#39;ve got curiosity within the having</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.059" end="00:28:02.470" style="s2">mode and that&#39;s great right because</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.789" end="00:28:06.020" style="s2">curiosity is problem-solving its it</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.470" end="00:28:07.669" style="s2">focused it has a focal object curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.020" end="00:28:11.480" style="s2">is directed what is that what does that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.669" end="00:28:13.460" style="s2">do how does that work wonder is its</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.480" end="00:28:16.820" style="s2">non-focal it&#39;s the opening up it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.460" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">it&#39;s the sense of right the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.820" end="00:28:20.390" style="s2">it&#39;s the perspective and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:24.050" style="s2">sense of Oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.390" end="00:28:28.910" style="s2">Oh ah right</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.050" end="00:28:30.200" style="s2">and what fuller argues is and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.910" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">use of work like people like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.200" end="00:28:35.750" style="s2">Frederickson and others it&#39;s these this</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:42.170" style="s2">emotion like this the the point of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.750" end="00:28:44.600" style="s2">wonder is right if if curiosity it gets</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.170" end="00:28:46.690" style="s2">you to focus in like on specific</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.600" end="00:28:49.310" style="s2">features of the world specific objects</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.690" end="00:28:52.820" style="s2">wonder tries to get you to participate</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.310" end="00:28:57.080" style="s2">in the gestalt the whole how does it all</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.820" end="00:29:00.740" style="s2">fit together all pushes you towards on</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.080" end="00:29:02.870" style="s2">opening an ongoing accommodation a sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.740" end="00:29:05.060" style="s2">of the inexhaustible nest the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.870" end="00:29:08.450" style="s2">combinatorially explosive nature of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.060" end="00:29:10.370" style="s2">reality and the ongoing evolving</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.450" end="00:29:15.410" style="s2">adaptability of your relevance</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.370" end="00:29:17.840" style="s2">realization to that explosive potential</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.410" end="00:29:20.870" style="s2">within reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.840" end="00:29:23.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what wonder does wonder isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.870" end="00:29:28.100" style="s2">about solving a problem wonder is about</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.500" end="00:29:30.530" style="s2">remembering sati your being by putting</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.100" end="00:29:35.050" style="s2">you deeply in touch notice the language</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.530" end="00:29:35.050" style="s2">in touch with religio</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.549" end="00:29:48.139" style="s2">okay now</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:55.130" style="s2">that brings me to another aspect that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.520" end="00:29:56.720" style="s2">overlaps with the primordial &#39;ti or what</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.130" end="00:30:03.680" style="s2">I&#39;m calling the fundamentality the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.720" end="00:30:05.990" style="s2">fundamental framing think about how</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.680" end="00:30:08.620" style="s2">wonder gives you something like the off</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.990" end="00:30:11.770" style="s2">again it gives you the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.620" end="00:30:16.420" style="s2">participating emerging want from</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.770" end="00:30:25.690" style="s2">co-creating with the ongoing course of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.420" end="00:30:27.590" style="s2">your world not as a story though but</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.690" end="00:30:30.200" style="s2">something you can talk about with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.590" end="00:30:32.750" style="s2">soy like we talked about evolution as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.200" end="00:30:35.300" style="s2">story but it isn&#39;t a self</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.750" end="00:30:38.230" style="s2">it isn&#39;t itself a story it&#39;s grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.300" end="00:30:38.230" style="s2">something deeper</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:44.179" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.010" end="00:30:49.419" style="s2">wonder aah it&#39;s not about solving</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.700" end="00:30:51.309" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.419" end="00:30:52.779" style="s2">remember the having mode is about</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.309" end="00:30:58.299" style="s2">solving problems the being mode is about</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.779" end="00:31:00.549" style="s2">confronting a mystery okay I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.299" end="00:31:09.309" style="s2">take it that this has been now etched</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.549" end="00:31:11.289" style="s2">into your brain and I am going to just</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.309" end="00:31:15.700" style="s2">say I&#39;m gonna rely on the word religio</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.289" end="00:31:18.279" style="s2">to invoke all of the right side and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.700" end="00:31:21.269" style="s2">fact that is dependent on the argument</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.279" end="00:31:24.100" style="s2">that came from the left side as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.269" end="00:31:27.899" style="s2">okay so think about wonder think about</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.100" end="00:31:30.820" style="s2">ah and what we&#39;ve been talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.899" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">this remembering of the being mode which</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.820" end="00:31:38.950" style="s2">is so central to spirituality right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:43.809" style="s2">that&#39;s another aspect of this okay so</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.950" end="00:31:48.070" style="s2">think about this as accommodation got</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.809" end="00:31:50.380" style="s2">opening up having to go right this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.070" end="00:31:53.260" style="s2">you when I accommodate I come to know</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.380" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">something by how I am transformed in</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.260" end="00:31:59.380" style="s2">order to come into contact with it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:03.070" style="s2">in my own myself knowing of how I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.380" end="00:32:05.230" style="s2">changed and my and the disclosure my</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.070" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">realization of that what that is are</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.230" end="00:32:14.760" style="s2">bound together like prototypically when</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:17.889" style="s2">you&#39;re in love with somebody to off okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.760" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">so this is accomodation and it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.889" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">being mode you&#39;re remembering sati</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.490" end="00:32:32.220" style="s2">and in the mean mode you&#39;re confronting</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.010" end="00:32:36.309" style="s2">a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.220" end="00:32:39.240" style="s2">do you remember talked about Marcel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.309" end="00:32:41.409" style="s2">idea about how a mystery right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.240" end="00:32:44.020" style="s2">notice the machine we got</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.409" end="00:32:46.289" style="s2">here&#39;s how I framed my problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.020" end="00:32:50.049" style="s2">I realize there&#39;s a kind of insight that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.289" end="00:32:52.450" style="s2">my so initially there&#39;s an insight that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.049" end="00:32:53.950" style="s2">oh that framing is itself problematic</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.450" end="00:32:56.230" style="s2">and I move to a more encompassing frame</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.950" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">and oh no and then what starts to happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.230" end="00:33:03.940" style="s2">is ah I&#39;m opening up ah right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:06.250" style="s2">opening up and my insight goes from a</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.940" end="00:33:08.260" style="s2">reframing from a to a trance framing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.250" end="00:33:10.990" style="s2">because I stopped having insights about</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.260" end="00:33:14.200" style="s2">my focal problem I start getting an</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.990" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">insight not about just the the problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.200" end="00:33:17.740" style="s2">or the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:19.240" style="s2">I also remember remember the sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.740" end="00:33:22.149" style="s2">transcendence I&#39;m also getting an</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.240" end="00:33:24.520" style="s2">insight into of the inadequacies of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.149" end="00:33:30.390" style="s2">my style of framing my way of framing</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.520" end="00:33:30.390" style="s2">I&#39;m getting a trans framing happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.860" end="00:33:41.649" style="s2">you get this trajectory of trans framing</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.760" end="00:33:42.010" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t stabilize and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.649" end="00:33:44.529" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.010" end="00:33:47.350" style="s2">it can&#39;t land on a focal object all</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.529" end="00:33:48.970" style="s2">that&#39;s disclosing all that&#39;s disclosing</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.350" end="00:33:55.090" style="s2">in the trajectory of trans framing is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.970" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">the machinery of religio and yet you</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.090" end="00:34:06.309" style="s2">find that like flow you find that deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.899" style="s2">meaningful to a point if it&#39;s pushed too</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.309" end="00:34:09.190" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.899" end="00:34:13.109" style="s2">it becomes deeply meaningful in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.190" end="00:34:13.109" style="s2">negative sense of horror</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:26.669" style="s2">now think about this think about how</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.200" end="00:34:27.330" style="s2">right and here&#39;s we have to be really</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.669" end="00:34:30.450" style="s2">careful here</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.330" end="00:34:35.310" style="s2">I want to talk about the that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.450" end="00:34:36.600" style="s2">mystery of religio but I need to make a</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.310" end="00:34:38.460" style="s2">distinction here that&#39;s a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.600" end="00:34:40.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve discussed before but let&#39;s go over</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.460" end="00:34:42.169" style="s2">it very carefully there&#39;s a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.230" end="00:34:45.000" style="s2">between something being a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.169" end="00:34:46.740" style="s2">phenomenological mystery and it being</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.000" end="00:34:50.220" style="s2">something that I cannot theoretically</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.080" end="00:36:19.170" style="s2">well what is it what what&#39;s at the core</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.470" end="00:36:20.550" style="s2">of religio well the death example</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.170" end="00:36:24.540" style="s2">actually points to something more</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.550" end="00:36:28.890" style="s2">primordial right it points to the fact</p>

<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:37:00.009" style="s2">frame is the framing process so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.759" end="00:37:02.910" style="s2">the frame or here&#39;s the frame even</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.009" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">better right and here&#39;s the framing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.910" end="00:37:07.390" style="s2">what&#39;s not in there is the framing oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:10.329" style="s2">you say Oh what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll do this</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:23.979" style="s2">outside here still is what is framing</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.930" end="00:37:26.529" style="s2">that you cannot have this in a part</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.979" end="00:37:30.759" style="s2">right well you can&#39;t have it as a focal</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.529" end="00:37:33.699" style="s2">object it is mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.759" end="00:37:36.279" style="s2">it is phenomenological mysterious James</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.699" end="00:37:38.229" style="s2">pointed to this and in a wonderful</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.699" end="00:37:55.449" style="s2">image and then I go deeper and say ah</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.469" end="00:37:57.420" style="s2">but here&#39;s the part of my right that was</p>

<p begin="00:43:08.869" end="00:43:13.400" style="s2">and you that you&#39;re capturing all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.210" end="00:43:14.780" style="s2">that I&#39;ll grant you all of that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.400" end="00:43:16.220" style="s2">you&#39;re not but look just for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.780" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">the argument I&#39;m granting you all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.220" end="00:43:22.280" style="s2">that but there&#39;s still something missing</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:25.579" style="s2">that I think is central to what how I</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.280" end="00:43:29.480" style="s2">use the word spirituality and what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.579" end="00:43:32.569" style="s2">would smell what&#39;s missing from religio</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.480" end="00:43:36.529" style="s2">that&#39;s found in religion is to confront</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.569" end="00:43:40.099" style="s2">the sacred I&#39;m trying to use a term as</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.529" end="00:43:43.279" style="s2">neutral as possible here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.099" end="00:43:45.470" style="s2">unclear I think if we should apply the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.279" end="00:43:47.569" style="s2">term divinity for example to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.470" end="00:43:49.789" style="s2">Buddhist notion of Shunyata or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.569" end="00:43:53.180" style="s2">Taoist notion of the Dao I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.789" end="00:43:56.690" style="s2">calling it divine is a plausible</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.180" end="00:43:58.309" style="s2">interpretation whereas God is divine I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.690" end="00:44:02.270" style="s2">don&#39;t think you should call the Dao</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.309" end="00:44:05.569" style="s2">divine but the Dao is clearly sacred in</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.270" end="00:44:08.809" style="s2">an important way and I think for many</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.569" end="00:44:13.779" style="s2">versions of Buddhism that Shunyata has a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.809" end="00:44:17.500" style="s2">kind of important kind of sacredness so</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.779" end="00:44:17.500" style="s2">the thing here is</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.780" end="00:44:30.810" style="s2">there&#39;s two there&#39;s two things we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.430" end="00:44:33.990" style="s2">to talk about and we have to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.810" end="00:44:38.869" style="s2">them carefully but keep them distinct</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.990" end="00:44:43.350" style="s2">but also show how they&#39;re connected so</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.869" end="00:44:46.350" style="s2">the sacred is typically when we want</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.350" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">some account of the metaphysics of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.350" end="00:44:51.869" style="s2">grounds our experience of sacredness so</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:59.160" style="s2">this is some this is basically a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.869" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">metaphysical proposal a standard Western</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.160" end="00:45:03.060" style="s2">proposal although I&#39;ve already given you</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:06.450" style="s2">an indication that it&#39;s not Universal</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.060" end="00:45:11.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not in things like Buddhism or</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.450" end="00:45:13.830" style="s2">Taoism is that the sacredness is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.510" end="00:45:17.610" style="s2">grounded the metaphysical proposal is</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.830" end="00:45:20.040" style="s2">grounded in being supernatural in some</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.610" end="00:45:22.680" style="s2">sense and of course that&#39;s again a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.040" end="00:45:24.810" style="s2">loaded term I&#39;m gonna use it and the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.680" end="00:45:27.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve argued for in this video series</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.810" end="00:45:29.160" style="s2">right something that you know is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.570" end="00:45:34.200" style="s2">historically constructed running through</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.160" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">people like Aquinas and beyond okay that</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.200" end="00:45:39.180" style="s2">now that&#39;s so this is the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:43.670" style="s2">proposal and then you ultimately have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.180" end="00:45:43.670" style="s2">psycho existential proposal over here</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:52.130" style="s2">which is proposal which is right well</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.670" end="00:45:55.020" style="s2">this is what it&#39;s like to experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.130" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">sacredness this distinction comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.020" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">fore for example historically and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:02.040" style="s2">there&#39;s so many people right I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:03.780" style="s2">could talk about more I need I need you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.040" end="00:46:06.630" style="s2">know I need three more series but if I</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.780" end="00:46:08.280" style="s2">tried to run this for 150 episodes my</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.630" end="00:46:10.080" style="s2">crew would kill me and then then there&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.280" end="00:46:11.609" style="s2">be a tragedy they&#39;d up in jail it just</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.080" end="00:46:13.050" style="s2">it just be a mess so I&#39;m going to stick</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.609" end="00:46:16.080" style="s2">to the 50 right</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.050" end="00:46:17.220" style="s2">but this proposed did pulling these</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.080" end="00:46:18.420" style="s2">apart you find this of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.220" end="00:46:21.390" style="s2">prototypically in the work of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.420" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">schleiermacher where he sort of puts</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.390" end="00:46:26.460" style="s2">aside this proposal because it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:28.830" style="s2">into serious disrepute</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.460" end="00:46:31.320" style="s2">because of the advent of the Scientific</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.830" end="00:46:32.369" style="s2">Revolution and he shifts towards well</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.320" end="00:46:34.650" style="s2">but what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.369" end="00:46:36.329" style="s2">psychological existential experience of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.650" end="00:46:38.099" style="s2">sacredness and you know his up his</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.329" end="00:46:40.170" style="s2">proposal that it&#39;s the experience of you</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.099" end="00:46:41.819" style="s2">know sort of absolute dependence and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.170" end="00:46:43.980" style="s2">coupled I would argue with things like</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.819" end="00:46:46.140" style="s2">Wonder and awe but that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.980" end="00:46:49.019" style="s2">distinction right it came to the fore</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.140" end="00:46:51.869" style="s2">and work by share market you can see a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.019" end="00:46:53.430" style="s2">lot of theological debate I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.869" end="00:46:55.740" style="s2">I can&#39;t do the argument here but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.430" end="00:46:58.200" style="s2">could see the lot of theological debate</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.740" end="00:47:00.599" style="s2">as the debate between a side that wants</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.200" end="00:47:06.809" style="s2">to emphasize sacredness and a side that</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.599" end="00:47:10.559" style="s2">wants to emphasize the sacred so I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.809" end="00:47:12.690" style="s2">to talk about this but I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.559" end="00:47:15.809" style="s2">about this in a way that reflects back</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.690" end="00:47:17.700" style="s2">on that why do I start here I start here</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.809" end="00:47:20.759" style="s2">because of course I&#39;ve argued that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.700" end="00:47:23.339" style="s2">religio is exactly a psycho existential</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.759" end="00:47:25.890" style="s2">very powerfully read this though no this</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.339" end="00:47:27.299" style="s2">has to do with modal right with you like</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.890" end="00:47:29.339" style="s2">the being mode it has to do with you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.299" end="00:47:30.329" style="s2">modal existence it has to do with trans</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.339" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">Jack tippity it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.329" end="00:47:34.440" style="s2">primordial tea you have to read this in</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:36.509" style="s2">a deeply high daguerreian sense right</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.440" end="00:47:38.789" style="s2">but that&#39;s what I mean it&#39;s a and psycho</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.509" end="00:47:40.859" style="s2">meaning right having to do with your</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.789" end="00:47:43.109" style="s2">cognitive processing all the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.859" end="00:47:45.589" style="s2">knowing right your embodiment your</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.109" end="00:47:47.910" style="s2">embeddedness so reading psycho</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.589" end="00:47:50.130" style="s2">psychological in also a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.910" end="00:47:52.739" style="s2">comprehensive way but I&#39;m clearly</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.130" end="00:47:54.299" style="s2">arguing that religions on here so first</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.739" end="00:47:57.869" style="s2">of all I should start here because</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.299" end="00:48:00.259" style="s2">that&#39;s where I&#39;m starting from and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.869" end="00:48:03.180" style="s2">want to talk about sacredness as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.259" end="00:48:07.739" style="s2">within a cycle existential sense and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.180" end="00:48:10.769" style="s2">then if I can if it&#39;s already done this</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.739" end="00:48:12.779" style="s2">right around this and our our relevance</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.769" end="00:48:14.819" style="s2">realization then I&#39;m going to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.779" end="00:48:16.440" style="s2">proposals about what this tells us about</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.819" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">the kinds of constraints that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.440" end="00:48:21.390" style="s2">available to us in our metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:26.940" style="s2">proposal and I&#39;m going to propose an</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.390" end="00:48:29.279" style="s2">alternative to this which I imagine will</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.940" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">be controversial but I hope that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.279" end="00:48:34.470" style="s2">controversial will be controversy will</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:38.940" style="s2">be constructive rather than merely</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.470" end="00:48:41.819" style="s2">adversarial all right so let&#39;s I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.940" end="00:48:43.079" style="s2">start here I&#39;m trying to be honest with</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.819" end="00:48:44.819" style="s2">you I&#39;m trying to be clear about what</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.079" end="00:48:45.660" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do I&#39;m not trying I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.819" end="00:48:47.250" style="s2">want to be shuffle</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.660" end="00:48:50.339" style="s2">any cards from the bottom of the deck</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.250" end="00:48:52.380" style="s2">here right and trying to be as upfront</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.339" end="00:48:54.359" style="s2">as I possibly can be of course I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.380" end="00:48:56.700" style="s2">I&#39;m biased or any kind of magical claim</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.359" end="00:48:58.380" style="s2">like that but I&#39;m trying my best to put</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.700" end="00:48:59.789" style="s2">the machinery that I&#39;m aware of using</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.380" end="00:49:02.190" style="s2">and then I&#39;m deliberately putting into</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.789" end="00:49:04.890" style="s2">play out front so that we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.190" end="00:49:08.369" style="s2">this as clearly and as honestly as</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.890" end="00:49:11.279" style="s2">possible okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.369" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk talk about sacred nips as</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.279" end="00:49:17.730" style="s2">a psycho existential thing and where I</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:26.910" style="s2">want to start right is in the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.730" end="00:49:29.160" style="s2">of the agent arena relationship and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.910" end="00:49:31.259" style="s2">want to bring back the work of Gerrits</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.160" end="00:49:37.109" style="s2">and we talked about the work of Brian</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.259" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">Walsh and we talked about this when we</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.109" end="00:49:43.380" style="s2">talked about DOM aside and Dom aside as</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.380" end="00:49:52.950" style="s2">an invariant Rafi Chur of sacredness</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.950" end="00:49:57.960" style="s2">so back rounded that we can I think</p>

<p begin="00:50:55.500" end="00:50:59.490" style="s2">definitely in the clear marker side of</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.210" end="00:51:09.060" style="s2">something that fits in with our argument</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.250" end="00:51:10.740" style="s2">very well geertz argues and be careful</p>

<p begin="00:51:10.740" end="00:51:16.590" style="s2">he argues that religion isn&#39;t a system</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:32.460" style="s2">remember I&#39;ve I&#39;m pulling these apart to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.730" end="00:52:34.740" style="s2">try and avoid that confusion so but what</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.460" end="00:52:38.810" style="s2">Garrett is talking about here is right</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.740" end="00:52:41.280" style="s2">yeah if you don&#39;t have that that none of</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.670" end="00:52:54.980" style="s2">of sacredness is what gives us the meta</p>

<p begin="00:53:39.029" end="00:53:47.400" style="s2">think that&#39;s a very important function</p>

<p begin="00:53:51.539" end="00:53:58.650" style="s2">Menem we we we have psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.069" end="00:54:01.499" style="s2">and I&#39;ll come back and give a definition</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.650" end="00:54:04.229" style="s2">of like a clear definition as we work</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.499" end="00:54:05.999" style="s2">that out of a psycho technology but we</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.229" end="00:54:09.029" style="s2">have psycho technologies that allow us</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.999" end="00:54:11.039" style="s2">to do this serious play right with</p>

<p begin="00:54:29.219" end="00:54:33.029" style="s2">one of the ways in which you can improve</p>

<p begin="00:54:33.029" end="00:54:37.799" style="s2">the world is to be committed to a</p>

<p begin="00:54:37.799" end="00:54:41.579" style="s2">and presumably it also has a history</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.579" end="00:54:46.229" style="s2">it has institutions etc and that would</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.650" end="00:55:11.210" style="s2">remember cost even used the word attune</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.540" end="00:55:14.630" style="s2">in there that&#39;s definitely a function of</p>

<p begin="00:55:14.630" end="00:55:20.210" style="s2">criticize kids I think that while this</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.060" end="00:55:22.250" style="s2">is definitely an important part up sorry</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.210" end="00:55:24.200" style="s2">I slipped I should have said a function</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.250" end="00:55:30.440" style="s2">of sacredness I made a mistake this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.200" end="00:55:36.619" style="s2">definitely a function of sacredness but</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.440" end="00:55:40.220" style="s2">I think that there is a mistake if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.619" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">think that sacredness can be reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.220" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">or identified solely with the machinery</p>

<p begin="00:55:49.400" end="00:55:55.430" style="s2">me that this is a necessary feature of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.030" end="00:56:00.589" style="s2">sacredness but I do not think it is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.430" end="00:56:02.570" style="s2">sufficient feature so if we go back to</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.589" end="00:56:04.190" style="s2">Hellenistic Damas idea if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.570" end="00:56:06.230" style="s2">we talked about the different kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.230" end="00:56:09.740" style="s2">there&#39;s things like stoicism and the</p>

<p begin="00:56:09.740" end="00:56:14.599" style="s2">was also Gnosticism and Gnosticism keeps</p>

<p begin="00:56:27.109" end="00:56:30.920" style="s2">important sense of religio that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.450" end="00:56:32.810" style="s2">definitely what&#39;s going on but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.920" end="00:56:35.599" style="s2">something interesting about the Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.810" end="00:56:37.460" style="s2">and that&#39;s the element that the kana</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.640" end="00:56:59.780" style="s2">is transgressive in a deep deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.150" end="00:57:04.430" style="s2">and I think that that points towards</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.780" end="00:57:10.550" style="s2">something else that the sacred does for</p>
