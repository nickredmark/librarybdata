<p begin="00:00:23.640" end="00:00:31.320" style="s2">with demonstration of some new newly</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.619" end="00:00:32.550" style="s2">managed technical wizardry I have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.320" end="00:00:33.960" style="s2">program that I developed with my</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.550" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">colleagues that I want to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.960" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">guys about for just a few seconds some</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">self authoring and self authoring helps</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.180" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">people write about their past to guide</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">it autobiography that&#39;s the past</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">authoring program and to write about</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">their virtues and their faults that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:51.539" style="s2">theirs to present authoring programs and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">a future authoring program that helps</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.539" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">people write out a vision and a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">destination let&#39;s say an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">destination for their lives as well as</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">formulate a plan to put that vision into</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">to make that vision into reality and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">experimental investigations have</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:11.189" style="s2">indicated for example that university</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:13.080" style="s2">students who complete this program even</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.189" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">if they do it badly and I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:17.159" style="s2">recommend at least doing it badly</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">increase their probability of staying at</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.159" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">university by about 30% and it has a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">positive effect on their grade point</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">average as well so there&#39;s a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">evidence that your personality is</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">organized at the highest level through</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">articulated speech some of that you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">formulate internally by thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">some of it you have to do you can do by</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">writing you also do that in discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:40.759" style="s2">with other people but these programs are</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">designed to break down the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.759" end="00:01:45.689" style="s2">articulating your life in the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:47.689" style="s2">present and future into a series of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.689" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">steps that are at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.689" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">manageable and thousands of people have</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">done them and I think there are very</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:57.899" style="s2">helpful programs and we spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">time perfecting them I supposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.899" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">degree that they are perfected anyways I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">want to here&#39;s the high tech part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:09.569" style="s2">this you see that&#39;s the website self</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">authoring com and I put a coupon</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.569" end="00:02:14.709" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:16.450" style="s2">the coupon name is September so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.709" end="00:02:18.459" style="s2">what you have to enter for the coupon</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.450" end="00:02:21.970" style="s2">and that gives you a 20% discount at</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.459" end="00:02:24.790" style="s2">self authoring so and now all this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.970" end="00:02:29.230" style="s2">even more high-tech because this marker</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.790" end="00:02:32.620" style="s2">is in a different color and this program</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.230" end="00:02:34.690" style="s2">is a personality test based on the big5</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.620" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">aspect scale which is a scale that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.690" end="00:02:39.129" style="s2">calling the young one of my students</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:42.849" style="s2">developed when he worked in my lab along</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.129" end="00:02:44.680" style="s2">with Lena quilty and the big five aspect</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.849" end="00:02:47.110" style="s2">scale offers you a five dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.680" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">readout of your personality extraversion</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.110" end="00:02:50.019" style="s2">neuroticism agreeableness</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:51.790" style="s2">conscientiousness and openness the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.019" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2">classic big five and then it breaks each</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.790" end="00:02:56.410" style="s2">of the factors each of the traits into</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:02:58.840" style="s2">two aspects so you get a high resolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:03:00.790" style="s2">map of your personality that takes the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.840" end="00:03:03.640" style="s2">test takes about 100 question takes</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.790" end="00:03:05.530" style="s2">about 15 minutes to do and you&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.640" end="00:03:07.269" style="s2">about yourself I think you&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.530" end="00:03:09.099" style="s2">interesting things I had my kids do</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.269" end="00:03:10.569" style="s2">repeated iterations of the big five</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.099" end="00:03:12.370" style="s2">aspect scale when they were teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.569" end="00:03:13.480" style="s2">and I learned a lot about them even</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.370" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">though I thought I knew them quite well</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.480" end="00:03:18.370" style="s2">I learned things that were very useful</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:19.870" style="s2">so you can do that and maybe you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.370" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">understand yourself a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.870" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">and so this is the site and the coupon</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">is September just as it was for self</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">authoring and that&#39;s 20% as well and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:51.250" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that amazingly enough this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:54.010" style="s2">advertisement I suppose which is what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.250" end="00:03:55.419" style="s2">is is in purple instead of blue and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.010" end="00:03:58.840" style="s2">that&#39;s another technological miracle</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.419" end="00:04:02.079" style="s2">brought to you by the internet and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:05.169" style="s2">intelligence of modern human beings so</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.079" end="00:04:06.880" style="s2">alright so we&#39;ve dispensed with that so</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.169" end="00:04:09.099" style="s2">that&#39;s self authoring and understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.880" end="00:04:16.269" style="s2">myself and you might find those useful</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.099" end="00:04:18.609" style="s2">and I hope you do so on to more fall on</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.269" end="00:04:22.060" style="s2">two different things I guess I just got</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.609" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">back to Toronto yesterday I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.060" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">yesterday I was out in Western Canada</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:30.280" style="s2">I went to a family reunion on Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:32.289" style="s2">Island and then a reunion of sorts as</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.280" end="00:04:35.349" style="s2">well in Saskatchewan with my side of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.289" end="00:04:37.810" style="s2">family and finished a talk in Regina and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.349" end="00:04:41.020" style="s2">when in Saskatoon as well which seem to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.810" end="00:04:43.300" style="s2">be relatively well received so hooray</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.020" end="00:04:45.400" style="s2">for that I&#39;ve really enjoyed all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.300" end="00:04:48.669" style="s2">lectures that I&#39;ve been giving Tammy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.400" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">I Tammy&#39;s my wife we&#39;ve visited 65</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.669" end="00:04:53.259" style="s2">cities now on this tour and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">starting again on September 5th we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.259" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">gonna go down the eastern seaboard</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">there&#39;s 20 cities and in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:05:00.970" style="s2">northeastern US and then we&#39;re off to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:02.770" style="s2">Europe for another 15 cities or so and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.970" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">then in February I think we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.770" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">go to Australia and then in March and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:11.190" style="s2">April and back to Europe and then in May</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:14.349" style="s2">I&#39;m going to spend four months</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.190" end="00:05:16.449" style="s2">diligently finishing up what I hope to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.349" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">be my next book assuming that I can get</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.449" end="00:05:21.550" style="s2">that done in that period of time and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:23.380" style="s2">also that other opportunities let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.550" end="00:05:26.169" style="s2">or distractions don&#39;t rear their head</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.380" end="00:05:27.970" style="s2">either positively or negatively and who</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.169" end="00:05:30.190" style="s2">knows right because life is a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.970" end="00:05:34.659" style="s2">uncertain business I&#39;ve really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.190" end="00:05:36.370" style="s2">the lecture tour a lot you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.659" end="00:05:40.780" style="s2">been speaking to audiences of about</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.370" end="00:05:43.210" style="s2">2,500 to 3,000 people and mostly about</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.780" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">the I would say mostly about the Nexus</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.210" end="00:05:48.130" style="s2">the relationship between meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:50.650" style="s2">responsibility trying to make the case</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.130" end="00:05:52.860" style="s2">that because life is difficult as</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.650" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">everyone with any sense knows and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.860" end="00:05:57.310" style="s2">because we can make that worse with our</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.120" end="00:05:59.770" style="s2">own stupidity and malevolence that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.310" end="00:06:02.889" style="s2">necessary to find a sustaining meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.770" end="00:06:05.080" style="s2">in life and my sense is and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.889" end="00:06:07.979" style="s2">people tend to agree to this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.080" end="00:06:10.180" style="s2">most sustaining meaning can be found a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.979" end="00:06:12.159" style="s2">and the adoption of voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.180" end="00:06:15.190" style="s2">responsibilities so in attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.159" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">decrease the suffering in life and to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.190" end="00:06:19.210" style="s2">things that are worthwhile and admirable</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:21.250" style="s2">and to take care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.210" end="00:06:22.569" style="s2">individually and your family and to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.250" end="00:06:24.759" style="s2">a little bit left over for your</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.569" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">community and to have goodwill across</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.759" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">all those dimensions if you can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:30.340" style="s2">manage it despite the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">something in life to make people</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.340" end="00:06:38.110" style="s2">relatively bitter and then as well the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:39.130" style="s2">necessity of conducting yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.110" end="00:06:42.010" style="s2">truthful manner</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.130" end="00:06:45.160" style="s2">making also the case to my listeners I</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.010" end="00:06:47.140" style="s2">suppose that that one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.160" end="00:06:49.030" style="s2">ancient presuppositions that underlies</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.140" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">the structure of Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.030" end="00:06:53.950" style="s2">which is a very functional civilization</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:58.510" style="s2">in my estimation is the idea derived</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.950" end="00:07:00.460" style="s2">from Genesis that truthful speech if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.510" end="00:07:03.370" style="s2">confront truthful speech if you confront</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.460" end="00:07:05.200" style="s2">potential the chaos and potential that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.370" end="00:07:08.170" style="s2">is in front of you with truthful speech</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.200" end="00:07:10.480" style="s2">that you engender the order that is good</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.170" end="00:07:12.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s a fundamental ethical dictum</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.480" end="00:07:14.830" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a presupposition in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.640" end="00:07:17.200" style="s2">sense that the order that you bring into</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.830" end="00:07:19.600" style="s2">existence in all the choices that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.200" end="00:07:21.340" style="s2">make will be the best possible order in</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.600" end="00:07:23.500" style="s2">proportion to the degree that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.340" end="00:07:26.620" style="s2">conduct yourself in a truthful manner</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.500" end="00:07:28.660" style="s2">and so those ideas seem to be falling on</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.620" end="00:07:32.260" style="s2">very receptive ears and they are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.660" end="00:07:34.750" style="s2">most resilient ideas that I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.260" end="00:07:36.910" style="s2">ever come across I mean I always take an</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.750" end="00:07:38.680" style="s2">ice pick and a hammer - any idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.910" end="00:07:40.330" style="s2">encounter and I really do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.680" end="00:07:42.730" style="s2">diligently because I don&#39;t want to rely</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.330" end="00:07:44.470" style="s2">on ideas that can fall apart and break</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.730" end="00:07:47.490" style="s2">especially when they&#39;re stressed and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.470" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">don&#39;t see I don&#39;t I haven&#39;t come across</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.490" end="00:07:52.480" style="s2">ideas that are more solid than that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:54.010" style="s2">mean the first proposition you know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.480" end="00:07:55.510" style="s2">life is suffering and that we make it</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.010" end="00:07:58.150" style="s2">worse with our malevolence I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.510" end="00:08:00.370" style="s2">everyone understands that to be true but</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.150" end="00:08:02.590" style="s2">the second is that the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.370" end="00:08:05.830" style="s2">confront that is to shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.590" end="00:08:07.750" style="s2">responsibility voluntarily and to live</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.830" end="00:08:09.850" style="s2">in truth I think those are even more</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.750" end="00:08:12.100" style="s2">powerful ideas because you could say</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.850" end="00:08:13.780" style="s2">that the cure for a malaise or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.100" end="00:08:15.880" style="s2">treatment for a disease is more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.780" end="00:08:18.730" style="s2">than the malhae malaise or the disease</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.880" end="00:08:20.860" style="s2">itself and if responsibility and truth</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.730" end="00:08:22.600" style="s2">are antidotes to suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.860" end="00:08:25.570" style="s2">malevolence then that means that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.600" end="00:08:27.760" style="s2">there they have a power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.570" end="00:08:29.380" style="s2">transcendent over suffering malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.760" end="00:08:31.210" style="s2">and you know it so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.380" end="00:08:33.729" style="s2">pessimistic viewpoint on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.210" end="00:08:36.040" style="s2">because I&#39;m stressing for everybody that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.729" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">is coming to listen to me talk the fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.040" end="00:08:41.800" style="s2">that life has an inalienable element of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:43.780" style="s2">difficulty and and travail and suffering</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.800" end="00:08:44.980" style="s2">and all of that and you certainly see</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.780" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">that sort of thing when you go to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.980" end="00:08:49.630" style="s2">family reunion you know like a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:51.220" style="s2">relatives my parents generation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.630" end="00:08:52.420" style="s2">getting old my parents are in their 80s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.220" end="00:08:53.800" style="s2">now and there</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.420" end="00:08:56.620" style="s2">some of they have friends that are older</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.800" end="00:08:59.050" style="s2">and everyone&#39;s starting to suffer from</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.620" end="00:09:00.850" style="s2">the inevitable deterioration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.050" end="00:09:02.620" style="s2">associated with old age and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.850" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">very trying and very difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.620" end="00:09:08.290" style="s2">people and it&#39;s it&#39;s in those situations</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.880" style="s2">that you see more clearly the fragility</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.290" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">of life and also the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.880" end="00:09:15.010" style="s2">having a having a family that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:16.870" style="s2">functional and people around you that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.010" end="00:09:18.670" style="s2">love you and all those things that in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.870" end="00:09:23.170" style="s2">principle can help sustain you through</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.670" end="00:09:25.810" style="s2">difficult times so anyways I&#39;m here in</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.170" end="00:09:29.620" style="s2">Toronto for about 10 days got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.810" end="00:09:34.030" style="s2">media interviews again partly to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.620" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">the upcoming talks my book 12 rules for</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.030" end="00:09:40.990" style="s2">life still appears to be selling</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:44.470" style="s2">extraordinarily well it&#39;s quite amazing</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.990" end="00:09:46.780" style="s2">all things considered it&#39;s approaching 2</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.470" end="00:09:49.420" style="s2">million sales and in in the English</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.780" end="00:09:50.260" style="s2">version and there are foreign versions</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.420" end="00:09:54.850" style="s2">coming out</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.260" end="00:09:57.490" style="s2">all the time so and I&#39;ve also I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.850" end="00:10:00.130" style="s2">in the process of putting together the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.490" end="00:10:02.230" style="s2">final arrangements for my next book</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.130" end="00:10:04.450" style="s2">which I talked about so the plan is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.230" end="00:10:05.980" style="s2">write I&#39;m writing that now I&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.450" end="00:10:07.780" style="s2">about half written maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.980" end="00:10:10.410" style="s2">more expanding on the themes that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.780" end="00:10:13.260" style="s2">developed in 12 rules for life and also</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.410" end="00:10:17.860" style="s2">extending them as much as I possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.260" end="00:10:19.810" style="s2">and I hope to continue writing during</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.860" end="00:10:21.640" style="s2">this period of touring as well so that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.810" end="00:10:23.770" style="s2">can stay on top of my deadlines and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.640" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">from May to September to spend most of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.770" end="00:10:28.690" style="s2">that time finalizing and editing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:31.150" style="s2">polishing and all of that and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.690" end="00:10:33.610" style="s2">hopefully the book is due in September</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.150" end="00:10:36.970" style="s2">and the current plan is to spend</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.610" end="00:10:39.160" style="s2">September through December likely</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.970" end="00:10:41.020" style="s2">concentrating on a return to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.160" end="00:10:42.100" style="s2">biblical lectures starting with Exodus</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.020" end="00:10:44.440" style="s2">which is something I&#39;m really looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.100" end="00:10:46.270" style="s2">forward to but haven&#39;t really been able</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.440" end="00:10:48.670" style="s2">to turn my hand to the other thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.270" end="00:10:50.380" style="s2">really thinking hard about doing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.670" end="00:10:51.730" style="s2">like to do a series of lectures and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.380" end="00:10:53.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I could do them publicly</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.730" end="00:10:55.210" style="s2">or not but I might be able to finagle</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.050" end="00:10:58.420" style="s2">that in some manner I&#39;d like to do a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.210" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">series of lectures on the sacred icons</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.420" end="00:11:03.850" style="s2">of the radical left so I&#39;d like to do a</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.000" end="00:11:06.160" style="s2">lecture series on Marx and Foucault and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:08.199" style="s2">Derrida and then some some</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.160" end="00:11:12.100" style="s2">the famous feminists to like Betty Ford</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.199" end="00:11:14.139" style="s2">an whose work I&#39;m not a fan of for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.100" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">variety of reasons and Judith Butler as</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.139" end="00:11:19.959" style="s2">well but I&#39;d really like to concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:22.180" style="s2">on Marx so one of the things I might do</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.959" end="00:11:24.279" style="s2">tea for you guys tonight or to you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.180" end="00:11:26.680" style="s2">one of the things I might do to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.279" end="00:11:29.550" style="s2">tonight as I found a poem by Karl Marx</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.680" end="00:11:32.680" style="s2">that is extraordinarily interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.550" end="00:11:34.870" style="s2">that might be worth reading if I can I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.680" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">just thought about doing that if I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.870" end="00:11:39.579" style="s2">scrape it up in time so let me just</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:41.290" style="s2">check very quickly and see if I can find</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.579" end="00:11:44.110" style="s2">it and then I&#39;ll get to some questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.290" end="00:11:51.759" style="s2">because after all this is a QA right</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.110" end="00:12:00.040" style="s2">that&#39;s the theory so give me 30 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.759" end="00:12:01.720" style="s2">if you can indulge me there it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.040" end="00:12:04.930" style="s2">so let me read this to you and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.720" end="00:12:06.250" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to the Q&amp;A I think this this</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.930" end="00:12:08.829" style="s2">is the kind of thing that I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.250" end="00:12:12.540" style="s2">shed light on in any possible lecture</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.829" end="00:12:15.540" style="s2">series on Marx so this is called</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.540" end="00:12:15.540" style="s2">invocation</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:35.190" style="s2">invocation of one in despair so a God</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.100" end="00:16:11.089" style="s2">wealth along with inequality and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:13.430" style="s2">wealth is definitely a fair proportion</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.959" end="00:16:24.350" style="s2">been accelerating over the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.879" end="00:16:26.089" style="s2">so from the year 2000 to the year 2012</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.350" end="00:16:28.459" style="s2">the level of absolute poverty in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.089" end="00:16:29.809" style="s2">world is halved which is the fastest</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.809" end="00:16:33.319" style="s2">history of the world and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.459" end="00:16:35.059" style="s2">rate is accelerating at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.319" end="00:16:38.410" style="s2">because the Soviet Union for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.059" end="00:16:40.670" style="s2">isn&#39;t around anymore to agitate the</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.329" end="00:16:49.069" style="s2">economic strategies and so what appears</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.579" end="00:16:51.529" style="s2">to be happening is that as we spread the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.069" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">fundamental Western ethos of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.529" end="00:16:53.900" style="s2">individuality and private property and</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">becoming richer even though at the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.360" end="00:17:07.640" style="s2">time we do pay a price for that in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:09.080" style="s2">inequality so there&#39;s a rule and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.640" end="00:17:10.570" style="s2">know how to formulate it exactly or</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.080" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">there seems to be a rule which is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.570" end="00:17:16.190" style="s2">given unit of wealth in a is produced at</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:17.690" style="s2">the cost of certain production of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:17.690" end="00:17:22.460" style="s2">inequality and that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.339" end="00:17:24.710" style="s2">inalienable to some degree so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.460" end="00:17:26.810" style="s2">that&#39;s part of a Marxist critique the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.710" end="00:17:28.430" style="s2">poem first which is like you want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.810" end="00:17:31.970" style="s2">listen to that poem a couple of times I</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.430" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">would say but then more fundamentally a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.970" end="00:17:36.500" style="s2">critique of the Marxist critique of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">West yes the West produces inequality</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.500" end="00:17:39.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s not something that you could</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:41.690" style="s2">lay at the feet of capitalism it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.320" end="00:17:43.160" style="s2">much much deeper problem and what that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.690" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">means to is that those people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.160" end="00:17:47.480" style="s2">purport to be on the side of the poor</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:48.590" style="s2">and dispossessed are not being friends</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.480" end="00:17:51.380" style="s2">to them by any stretch of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.590" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">imagination at all by attempting to tear</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.380" end="00:17:55.010" style="s2">down the very hierarchies that seem to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:57.290" style="s2">be leveraging the world&#39;s poorest people</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.010" end="00:17:59.240" style="s2">out of poverty as rapidly as possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.290" end="00:18:00.800" style="s2">there&#39;s evidence as well that people</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.240" end="00:18:02.360" style="s2">start to become very concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.800" end="00:18:04.580" style="s2">environment if you can get their family</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.360" end="00:18:07.490" style="s2">income I think are its GDP I think up</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.580" end="00:18:10.100" style="s2">about of 40 above about 4,500 u.s. a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.490" end="00:18:11.540" style="s2">year they start to have a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.100" end="00:18:13.820" style="s2">spare time to be concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.540" end="00:18:16.310" style="s2">environment around them and so the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.820" end="00:18:19.790" style="s2">way to to ecological balance in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.310" end="00:18:21.680" style="s2">world seems to be to make people rich as</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.790" end="00:18:23.510" style="s2">fast as we possibly can to make the poor</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.680" end="00:18:25.100" style="s2">rich as fast as we possibly can and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.510" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that be lovely if that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.100" end="00:18:34.760" style="s2">really the way out so anyways you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:40.060" style="s2">for that so let&#39;s let&#39;s try some</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.760" end="00:18:42.770" style="s2">questions here so any advice on</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.060" end="00:18:45.050" style="s2">effectively implementing what I learned</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.770" end="00:18:46.910" style="s2">into my life i resonate with twelve</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.050" end="00:18:48.710" style="s2">rules so much when reading but struggle</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.910" end="00:18:51.320" style="s2">to remember it in my day to day life</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.710" end="00:18:53.810" style="s2">well you&#39;re not alone that was Sam</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.320" end="00:18:55.400" style="s2">you&#39;re not alone in that Sam I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.810" end="00:18:58.630" style="s2">first of all you got to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.400" end="00:19:02.230" style="s2">your time frame is you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.630" end="00:19:04.760" style="s2">truisms of clinical psychology is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.230" end="00:19:07.220" style="s2">slow and incremental improvement is</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.760" end="00:19:08.690" style="s2">first of all normative</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.220" end="00:19:10.760" style="s2">in the best possible way in the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.690" end="00:19:12.830" style="s2">optimistic situation but also very</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.760" end="00:19:14.090" style="s2">powerful and so of course you struggle</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.830" end="00:19:16.429" style="s2">to remember it in your day-to-day life</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.090" end="00:19:18.169" style="s2">because life is difficult and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.429" end="00:19:19.669" style="s2">harder to do things than not to do them</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.169" end="00:19:21.710" style="s2">and it&#39;s harder to do them well than to</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.669" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">do them badly you know and it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.710" end="00:19:25.700" style="s2">sit around and be hopeless I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:29.270" style="s2">it&#39;s emotionally easy because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.700" end="00:19:31.820" style="s2">but it&#39;s procedurally easy to be useless</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.270" end="00:19:34.909" style="s2">and to fall back into your old habits</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.820" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">and to not discipline yourself and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.909" end="00:19:39.650" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of continual practice slow</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:41.870" style="s2">continual practice and I think a good</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.650" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">example of that is something like weight</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.870" end="00:19:44.659" style="s2">lifting you know if you start a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:46.820" style="s2">weightlifting program which I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.659" end="00:19:49.340" style="s2">recommend by the way because it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.820" end="00:19:51.950" style="s2">tremendously advantageous physically and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.340" end="00:19:53.659" style="s2">cognitively you&#39;re not gonna really see</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.950" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">results for a number of weeks and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.659" end="00:19:57.530" style="s2">the results are rather slow but you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:19:59.030" style="s2">get pretty decent results over a six</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.530" end="00:20:00.950" style="s2">month period and absolutely stellar</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.030" end="00:20:02.690" style="s2">results over a couple of years and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.950" end="00:20:04.039" style="s2">you have to make sure your timeframe is</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.690" end="00:20:07.190" style="s2">right and not to be too hard on yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.039" end="00:20:11.539" style="s2">and I did mention the future authoring</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.190" end="00:20:13.070" style="s2">program earlier and one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.539" end="00:20:16.909" style="s2">would recommend too is if you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.070" end="00:20:18.740" style="s2">a hard time implementing your your</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.909" end="00:20:20.900" style="s2">decisions say your ethical decisions</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.740" end="00:20:22.100" style="s2">that you spend a bit more time thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.900" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">them through and writing them down and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.100" end="00:20:25.130" style="s2">the future authoring program is really</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:28.580" style="s2">helpful thought that&#39;s why we designed</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.130" end="00:20:31.070" style="s2">it and so get your goal straight and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.580" end="00:20:32.510" style="s2">continue to practice every day and if</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.070" end="00:20:34.940" style="s2">you&#39;re not succeeding then make your</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.510" end="00:20:37.490" style="s2">goals slightly smaller you want to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.940" end="00:20:39.350" style="s2">want to make your goals large enough so</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.490" end="00:20:40.909" style="s2">that they challenge you but small enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.350" end="00:20:43.010" style="s2">so that you have a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.909" end="00:20:45.770" style="s2">probability of succeeding at them on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.010" end="00:20:47.570" style="s2">day to day basis and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.770" end="00:20:49.070" style="s2">also understand that if you fail on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.570" end="00:20:50.510" style="s2">given day like let&#39;s say you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:52.190" style="s2">to quit smoking and you quit for two</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.510" end="00:20:53.809" style="s2">weeks and then you have a cigarette and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.190" end="00:20:56.210" style="s2">you think oh my god now I&#39;ve screwed it</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.809" end="00:20:58.330" style="s2">up I&#39;m not quitting anymore you smoke a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.210" end="00:21:00.710" style="s2">whole pack of cigarettes it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.330" end="00:21:03.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of mistakes there and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.710" end="00:21:06.020" style="s2">one is well just because you had a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.710" end="00:21:07.880" style="s2">cigarette doesn&#39;t mean you failed it</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.020" end="00:21:10.340" style="s2">just means that you had a cigarette you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.880" end="00:21:13.370" style="s2">can start stopping again the next day</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.340" end="00:21:15.230" style="s2">and the fact that you had one cigarette</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.370" end="00:21:16.610" style="s2">in the last two weeks is a hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.230" end="00:21:19.419" style="s2">better than the two weeks that you had</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.610" end="00:21:21.080" style="s2">before that and so you&#39;ve got to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.419" end="00:21:22.940" style="s2">realistically humble</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.080" end="00:21:24.590" style="s2">you got to be ambitious enough in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.940" end="00:21:27.050" style="s2">goal so that you&#39;re pursuing something</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.590" end="00:21:29.810" style="s2">that you regard as truly meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.050" end="00:21:32.090" style="s2">worthwhile you know and maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.810" end="00:21:33.770" style="s2">judge that to some degree if you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.090" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">about someone you love attempting the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.770" end="00:21:37.400" style="s2">same thing and think about how you would</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:40.460" style="s2">feel if they managed it and if you would</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.400" end="00:21:44.680" style="s2">feel good then that&#39;s probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.460" end="00:21:44.680" style="s2">what would you say that would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.490" end="00:21:51.470" style="s2">evaluation strategy to use on yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.940" end="00:21:53.420" style="s2">you so you want your goals to be of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.470" end="00:21:54.950" style="s2">sufficient nobility so that you can live</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.420" end="00:21:56.360" style="s2">with yourself properly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.950" end="00:21:57.680" style="s2">pursuing them but you want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.360" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">small enough so that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.680" end="00:22:03.940" style="s2">reasonable probability of implementing</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:03.940" style="s2">them and if your implementation</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.020" end="00:23:14.530" style="s2">okay it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.370" end="00:23:14.530" style="s2">it&#39;s back you can start again</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.100" end="00:23:24.100" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.550" end="00:23:30.760" style="s2">we&#39;re back yeah okay guys well that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.179" end="00:23:33.220" style="s2">interesting the software that I used on</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.760" end="00:23:35.530" style="s2">my camera crashed and then when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.220" end="00:23:37.390" style="s2">reopened it it told me I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.530" end="00:23:38.950" style="s2">purchased it and wanted me to re-enter</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.390" end="00:23:43.210" style="s2">the serial number which is quite the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.950" end="00:23:47.050" style="s2">interesting experience so so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.210" end="00:23:48.790" style="s2">getting my questions back up this 3/4</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.050" end="00:23:50.860" style="s2">person that you see here is Julian who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.790" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">you know reasonably helpful about these</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.860" end="00:23:57.340" style="s2">sorts of things now and then I&#39;ve out</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:23:58.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve almost actually learned how to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.340" end="00:24:00.460" style="s2">this I tell you you do get slower</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.690" end="00:24:02.620" style="s2">technologically as you get older it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.460" end="00:24:04.540" style="s2">kind of annoying or maybe you get just</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.620" end="00:24:06.790" style="s2">fed up with it more it&#39;s hard to tell I</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.540" end="00:24:09.220" style="s2">think you&#39;re probably stupider and less</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.790" end="00:24:11.380" style="s2">patient and so then you justify your</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.220" end="00:24:16.920" style="s2">last your stupidity by just assuming</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.380" end="00:24:16.920" style="s2">that you&#39;re less patient so ok anyways</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.950" end="00:24:28.150" style="s2">we&#39;re back thanks Julian ok so Paul</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.010" end="00:24:30.130" style="s2">Maloney says you mentioned analyzing one</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.150" end="00:24:31.540" style="s2">of your wife&#39;s dreams that left you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.130" end="00:24:34.390" style="s2">feeling hopeful that will emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.540" end="00:24:38.710" style="s2">this chaos okay do you still feel this</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.390" end="00:24:47.920" style="s2">way any new signs well who knows right</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.710" end="00:24:50.580" style="s2">because because the future is</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.920" end="00:24:53.740" style="s2">complicated and no one&#39;s a prophet I</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.580" end="00:24:56.950" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to think I think this I</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.740" end="00:25:03.910" style="s2">guess I already mentioned earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.950" end="00:25:06.700" style="s2">this Q&amp;A that on a global level there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.910" end="00:25:08.350" style="s2">all sorts of reasons for real optimism</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.700" end="00:25:10.330" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned there&#39;s reasons</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.350" end="00:25:13.150" style="s2">for pessimism as well but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.330" end="00:25:15.790" style="s2">reasons for real optimism and what look</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.150" end="00:25:20.200" style="s2">it looks to me like what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.790" end="00:25:24.820" style="s2">that the spread of the Western free</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.200" end="00:25:28.590" style="s2">market individualist ethos around the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.820" end="00:25:32.050" style="s2">world is producing a substantive</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.590" end="00:25:35.050" style="s2">increment in wealth substantive decrease</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.050" end="00:25:37.660" style="s2">in poverty and the consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.050" end="00:25:38.380" style="s2">decrease in poverty is also in places</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.660" end="00:25:40.809" style="s2">like China</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.380" end="00:25:42.250" style="s2">which by the way China is reforesting so</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.809" end="00:25:44.650" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty interesting China is now</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.250" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">rich enough so that it can afford to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.650" end="00:25:48.580" style="s2">reforest so there&#39;s more forests in</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:50.500" style="s2">China than there was in 1990 which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.580" end="00:25:52.950" style="s2">quite a remarkable thing anyways my</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.500" end="00:25:57.000" style="s2">point is is that on the global scale</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.950" end="00:26:00.280" style="s2">things appeared to be very positive and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.000" end="00:26:02.110" style="s2">but then in the West we seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.280" end="00:26:06.340" style="s2">suffering from a crisis of confidence</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.110" end="00:26:07.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s destabilizing us and making</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.340" end="00:26:10.090" style="s2">us act foolishly</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.750" end="00:26:11.980" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know how much of a threat</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.090" end="00:26:16.380" style="s2">that is to the integrity of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.980" end="00:26:21.250" style="s2">political system and I&#39;m so much in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.380" end="00:26:23.409" style="s2">middle of this let&#39;s say personally that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.250" end="00:26:27.820" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to have a clear hand</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.409" end="00:26:29.650" style="s2">about it now I&#39;m very optimistic about a</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.820" end="00:26:31.419" style="s2">variety of things that I see I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.650" end="00:26:35.350" style="s2">optimistic for example about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.419" end="00:26:36.970" style="s2">that so many people have are coming out</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.350" end="00:26:42.820" style="s2">to these long-form lectures and paying</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.970" end="00:26:44.890" style="s2">attention to high complexity educational</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.820" end="00:26:48.190" style="s2">and political material on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.890" end="00:26:50.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a real hunger for that and I as</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.190" end="00:26:53.620" style="s2">I said before the lecture tour that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.620" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">on has been extremely positive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.620" end="00:26:56.350" style="s2">really something to see all these</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:58.929" style="s2">thousands of people come out to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.350" end="00:27:00.970" style="s2">concentrate on getting their lives</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.929" end="00:27:02.230" style="s2">together and I do believe that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.970" end="00:27:05.140" style="s2">why people are coming out and then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.230" end="00:27:09.549" style="s2">know I think I don&#39;t remember if I did a</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.140" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">QA since I did the discussions with Sam</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.549" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">Harris but I did for discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">him for debates let&#39;s say each of which</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:22.380" style="s2">was about two hours long - in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:24.940" style="s2">one in Dublin and one in London UK and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.380" end="00:27:27.669" style="s2">there were about 3,000 people at each of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.940" end="00:27:30.490" style="s2">the Vancouver events 8500 people in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.669" end="00:27:33.789" style="s2">Dublin and something approximating 6500</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.490" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">in London and the audience was very</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.789" end="00:27:40.450" style="s2">attentive for the two-hour stretch for</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:46.840" style="s2">all four discussions and so I do see the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.450" end="00:27:50.470" style="s2">I see more intelligence in the general</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:51.820" style="s2">population say then I think we presumed</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.470" end="00:27:53.650" style="s2">was there and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.820" end="00:27:59.290" style="s2">more hunger for serious discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.650" end="00:28:03.190" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping that people who are</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.290" end="00:28:06.100" style="s2">clear-headed and sensible can push back</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.190" end="00:28:09.990" style="s2">the idiot collectivist radicals on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.100" end="00:28:13.960" style="s2">left and on the right we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.990" end="00:28:16.330" style="s2">so yeah I&#39;m hopeful because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.960" end="00:28:19.540" style="s2">people are remarkable creatures despite</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.330" end="00:28:21.940" style="s2">their limitations and the absurdity of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.540" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">our existence and our proclivity toward</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.940" end="00:28:32.800" style="s2">malevolence I think that we can whatever</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.980" end="00:32:06.970" style="s2">one of the restrictions you assume</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.690" end="00:32:10.390" style="s2">should be placed on free speech is that</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.690" end="00:32:18.130" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t seem to be an unreasonable</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.910" end="00:32:18.550" style="s2">proposition and is perhaps even the sort</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.310" end="00:32:30.280" style="s2">get behind well then that means that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.370" end="00:32:33.370" style="s2">you&#39;ve defined already a framework in</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.280" end="00:32:34.870" style="s2">which is that censorship and or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.370" end="00:32:37.450" style="s2">I&#39;m not thinking this through clearly</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.870" end="00:32:38.560" style="s2">but is that censorship it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.450" end="00:32:41.020" style="s2">self-protection</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.560" end="00:32:43.530" style="s2">well then having established the</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.280" end="00:32:55.900" style="s2">do you stop and the answer is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.810" end="00:32:59.080" style="s2">complicated I think that what Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.900" end="00:32:59.770" style="s2">etc did with Alex Jones was a big</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.080" end="00:33:02.950" style="s2">mistake</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.770" end="00:33:05.560" style="s2">I think that was because well it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.950" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">just Alex Jones that was punished let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.410" end="00:33:14.920" style="s2">watching him was an avid follower of him</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.360" end="00:33:16.990" style="s2">some people were just watching him to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.920" end="00:33:18.820" style="s2">see what the hell he was doing and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.990" end="00:33:20.920" style="s2">he was up to and that&#39;s necessary but</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.820" end="00:33:22.750" style="s2">you don&#39;t just censor the one person you</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.920" end="00:33:24.400" style="s2">censor everybody that&#39;s paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.750" end="00:33:27.520" style="s2">to him and then you make him a martyr</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.400" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">and you persecute someone who&#39;s paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.520" end="00:33:31.510" style="s2">which all that does is validate his</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:34.060" style="s2">conspiracy theories as conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.510" end="00:33:38.740" style="s2">theories and the conspiratorial theories</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.060" end="00:33:40.540" style="s2">of his followers I guess one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.740" end="00:33:45.100" style="s2">things I&#39;ve really been wondering is if</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.540" end="00:33:48.550" style="s2">the wild and woolly reality of Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.100" end="00:33:51.480" style="s2">and YouTube and Twitter are actually</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.480" end="00:33:57.190" style="s2">or if the radical freedom that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:59.950" style="s2">associated with those technologies was</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.190" end="00:34:02.200" style="s2">only something that was possible when in</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.090" end="00:34:10.270" style="s2">material was outside the standard legal</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.230" end="00:34:13.480" style="s2">framework because it was too new to</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.760" end="00:35:44.570" style="s2">learned a lot about the brain what</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.310" style="s2">prompted my interest in that area and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.570" end="00:35:47.990" style="s2">your apparent shift to issues clustered</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.310" end="00:35:50.570" style="s2">around personality well I was always</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.990" end="00:35:52.460" style="s2">interested in motivation for drug and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.570" end="00:35:57.470" style="s2">alcohol abuse you know what it was that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.460" end="00:36:00.680" style="s2">drove people to use drugs of abuse let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.470" end="00:36:02.810" style="s2">say and I got the opportunity to study</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.680" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">at McGill under dr. Robert Peel who was</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.810" end="00:36:07.970" style="s2">an excellent supervisor and he was</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:11.270" style="s2">deeply involved with drug and alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.970" end="00:36:12.830" style="s2">abuse research looking at motivation for</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.270" end="00:36:15.380" style="s2">alcoholism and he offered me a position</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.830" end="00:36:16.970" style="s2">in his lab and and that was what he was</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.380" end="00:36:19.130" style="s2">working on and I thought well that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.970" end="00:36:22.850" style="s2">one of my cardinal interests although</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.130" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">perhaps not my my fundamental interest</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.850" end="00:36:27.320" style="s2">which even at that point had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:28.910" style="s2">motivation for totalitarianism and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.320" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">commission of atrocity and the service</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.910" end="00:36:34.580" style="s2">of of group belief but I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:37.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a broad topic and I could learn a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.580" end="00:36:39.020" style="s2">lot about biology and neurobiology as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.460" end="00:36:41.660" style="s2">consequence of working on something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.020" end="00:36:43.520" style="s2">was so biological so my my early work in</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.660" end="00:36:44.539" style="s2">psychology was extremely biologically</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:46.609" style="s2">oriented and it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.539" end="00:36:48.619" style="s2">unbelievably useful I learned a lot from</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.609" end="00:36:50.929" style="s2">the animal experimentalist in particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.619" end="00:36:54.140" style="s2">people like Jeffrey gray and later yak</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.929" end="00:36:56.209" style="s2">panksepp I have a reading list at Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.140" end="00:36:58.999" style="s2">B Peterson comm that outlines some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.209" end="00:37:03.439" style="s2">those emotional so those books on</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.999" end="00:37:06.349" style="s2">emotional neuroscience um what was my</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.439" end="00:37:08.329" style="s2">why did I shift well there was a variety</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.349" end="00:37:10.429" style="s2">of reasons one was that the National</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.329" end="00:37:11.239" style="s2">Institute of Alcohol Abuse and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.429" end="00:37:14.410" style="s2">Alcoholism</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.239" end="00:37:16.219" style="s2">and I Triple A which funded grant</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.410" end="00:37:18.259" style="s2">research in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.219" end="00:37:20.089" style="s2">essentially made the kind of research I</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.259" end="00:37:22.819" style="s2">was doing with Robert Peel impossible</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.089" end="00:37:23.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s part of the consequence I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.819" end="00:37:25.549" style="s2">this is one of the things that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.900" end="00:37:27.859" style="s2">universities are doing so terribly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.549" end="00:37:30.999" style="s2">as the ethics committees made our</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.859" end="00:37:33.469" style="s2">research impossible both to fund and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.999" end="00:37:36.589" style="s2">implement so here&#39;s why so we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.469" end="00:37:38.660" style="s2">bringing people into the lab so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.589" end="00:37:39.890" style="s2">who we picked for subjects if you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.660" end="00:37:42.049" style="s2">going to be a subject in one of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.890" end="00:37:45.439" style="s2">experiments you had to be a young man</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.049" end="00:37:48.739" style="s2">and you had to have an alcoholic father</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.439" end="00:37:50.630" style="s2">and an alcoholic grandfather and at</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.739" end="00:37:54.369" style="s2">least one other first or second degree</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.630" end="00:37:54.369" style="s2">male alcoholic relative</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.820" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">well I hope I&#39;m back again you know my</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.410" end="00:38:46.370" style="s2">software updated and obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:50.830" style="s2">update has a bug so that&#39;s rather</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.370" end="00:38:55.090" style="s2">annoying apologies for that once again</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.830" end="00:38:58.390" style="s2">so back to the alcoholism discussion</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.090" end="00:39:01.400" style="s2">where was I oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.390" end="00:39:03.050" style="s2">so we would get these subjects I</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.400" end="00:39:05.300" style="s2">mentioned who they were they were young</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.050" end="00:39:08.090" style="s2">men who weren&#39;t alcoholic but who drank</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.300" end="00:39:10.760" style="s2">socially who had an alcoholic father an</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.090" end="00:39:12.890" style="s2">alcoholic grandfather and at least one</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.760" end="00:39:14.570" style="s2">other male alcoholic relative now why</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.890" end="00:39:16.970" style="s2">did we pick subjects like that well we</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.570" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">knew alcoholism ran in families and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.970" end="00:39:20.450" style="s2">couldn&#39;t really study its transmission</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:22.790" style="s2">in women because if you&#39;re a female</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.450" end="00:39:24.740" style="s2">alcoholic can you drink when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.790" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">child in utero then the you child can</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.740" end="00:39:29.180" style="s2">have fetal alcohol syndrome and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.250" end="00:39:32.810" style="s2">abnormalities in psychophysiological</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.180" end="00:39:35.570" style="s2">response or psychopathologies might be</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.810" end="00:39:37.580" style="s2">associated with their alcoholism can</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.570" end="00:39:40.490" style="s2">easily be masked by the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.580" end="00:39:43.550" style="s2">fetal alcohol syndrome so we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.490" end="00:39:45.740" style="s2">use women and besides alcoholism is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.550" end="00:39:47.390" style="s2">problem that fundamentally characterizes</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.740" end="00:39:49.310" style="s2">men although there are female alcoholics</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.390" end="00:39:51.470" style="s2">I think it&#39;s four to one if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.310" end="00:39:53.960" style="s2">correctly from from those days it&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.470" end="00:39:55.460" style="s2">to one male to female so it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.960" end="00:39:57.530" style="s2">when we thought if we concentrated on</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.460" end="00:39:59.150" style="s2">those who had the highest probability of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.530" end="00:40:01.310" style="s2">developing alcoholism because of their</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.150" end="00:40:03.020" style="s2">loaded family history that we could shed</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.310" end="00:40:04.490" style="s2">some light on the mechanisms associated</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.020" end="00:40:06.500" style="s2">with alcoholism and that would be useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.490" end="00:40:08.330" style="s2">for men and for women so we studied sons</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.500" end="00:40:10.460" style="s2">of male alcoholics sons of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.330" end="00:40:12.140" style="s2">multi-generational male alcoholics those</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.460" end="00:40:13.850" style="s2">were our target group very hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.140" end="00:40:16.310" style="s2">populations to fight we have people</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.850" end="00:40:18.500" style="s2">hired full-time to do nothing but find</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.310" end="00:40:20.450" style="s2">us research subjects and so we did</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.500" end="00:40:22.280" style="s2">relatively small in studies because we</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.450" end="00:40:24.290" style="s2">were lucky if we could gather four or</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.280" end="00:40:27.950" style="s2">five subjects a month in the Montreal</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.290" end="00:40:29.690" style="s2">urban area anyways we did discover a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.950" end="00:40:32.510" style="s2">about alcoholism we discovered for</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.690" end="00:40:35.330" style="s2">example that if people with this</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.510" end="00:40:37.640" style="s2">multi-generational history a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.330" end="00:40:39.770" style="s2">proportion of them if they drank enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.640" end="00:40:42.020" style="s2">alcohol to move their blood level up</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.770" end="00:40:44.660" style="s2">above 0.08 which is legal intoxication</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.020" end="00:40:47.090" style="s2">level and if they did that relatively</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.660" end="00:40:49.460" style="s2">short period of time then their heart</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.090" end="00:40:51.589" style="s2">rate would increase above I think the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.460" end="00:40:55.880" style="s2">average was about 12 beats per minute</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.589" end="00:40:58.699" style="s2">do the standard control of zero zero or</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.880" end="00:41:00.349" style="s2">one or two it was very low and so and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.699" end="00:41:02.239" style="s2">then we did figure out overtime our</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.349" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">whole team that that seemed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.239" end="00:41:07.430" style="s2">consequence of susceptibility to</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">alcohols effect on opioid production in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.430" end="00:41:12.170" style="s2">the brain and secondary or opioid</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:14.119" style="s2">effects on dopamine which is both</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.170" end="00:41:16.339" style="s2">opiates and dopamine are primarily</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.119" end="00:41:18.140" style="s2">primary reward chemicals so it looked to</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.339" end="00:41:20.239" style="s2">us like people with multi-generational</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.140" end="00:41:23.390" style="s2">family histories of alcoholism got an</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.239" end="00:41:26.119" style="s2">opiate response from alcohol so but we</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.390" end="00:41:28.130" style="s2">had to get people drunk in order to find</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.119" end="00:41:30.079" style="s2">this response and it turned out that</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.130" end="00:41:32.299" style="s2">0.08 which was the legal limit at that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">time for driving was approximately the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.299" end="00:41:35.390" style="s2">place where we saw these psycho</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:37.549" style="s2">physiological effects and also saw</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.390" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">fairly pronounced cognitive and motor</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.549" end="00:41:43.069" style="s2">effects of alcohol because we also</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:44.689" style="s2">studied that so now to bring we bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.069" end="00:41:46.910" style="s2">people into the lab and we&#39;d give them</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.689" end="00:41:48.380" style="s2">three large shots of alcohol that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.910" end="00:41:51.380" style="s2">consumed in ten minutes we use</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.380" end="00:41:52.849" style="s2">laboratory alcohol which was I think 95%</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.380" end="00:41:56.599" style="s2">pure alcohol usually put it in orange</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.849" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">juice and so people would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.599" end="00:42:00.439" style="s2">reasonably intoxicated and then we would</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:02.900" style="s2">let them sober up until they were at</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.439" end="00:42:04.429" style="s2">point O four which is half legal</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.900" end="00:42:05.959" style="s2">intoxication which we thought was useful</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.429" end="00:42:08.209" style="s2">and then we put them in a cabin and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.959" end="00:42:10.609" style="s2">they&#39;d go home and we you know we had</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.209" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">our own mishap now and then someone</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.609" end="00:42:18.769" style="s2">would throw up and that was well I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">least getting better at fixing it when</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.769" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">it screws up now so you know and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:27.109" style="s2">anyways now and then we would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:28.579" style="s2">somebody who would be coming in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.109" end="00:42:30.410" style="s2">and that was always unpleasant but then</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.579" end="00:42:32.479" style="s2">we&#39;d also let people sober up but it</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.410" end="00:42:34.519" style="s2">actually takes quite a long time to go</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.479" end="00:42:36.679" style="s2">from point O eight to 0.04 especially if</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.519" end="00:42:38.359" style="s2">you&#39;re a big guy because your your dose</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.679" end="00:42:39.799" style="s2">of alcohol is proportionate to your body</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.359" end="00:42:41.150" style="s2">weight and so we used to have people</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.799" end="00:42:43.719" style="s2">wait in the lab for a couple of hours</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.150" end="00:42:45.679" style="s2">you know and they were not very happy</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.719" end="00:42:48.890" style="s2">necessarily about having to wait before</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.679" end="00:42:50.479" style="s2">we paid them and so forth and and and if</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.890" end="00:42:52.279" style="s2">we didn&#39;t treat them extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.479" end="00:42:53.660" style="s2">well which we tried to do then of course</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.279" end="00:42:55.579" style="s2">they were much less likely to come back</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.660" end="00:42:57.259" style="s2">and participate in another study and</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.579" end="00:42:59.959" style="s2">since it was very difficult to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.259" end="00:43:01.519" style="s2">research subjects then we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.959" end="00:43:03.679" style="s2">treat them very well apart from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.519" end="00:43:05.390" style="s2">that we would have done that anyways but</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.679" end="00:43:06.740" style="s2">then and I triple ace</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.390" end="00:43:08.810" style="s2">well you can&#39;t let your research</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.740" end="00:43:11.540" style="s2">subjects go home until they have a blood</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.810" end="00:43:13.010" style="s2">alcohol level of 0.02 I was like we</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.540" end="00:43:20.990" style="s2">would have had to have people in our lab</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.010" end="00:43:23.090" style="s2">you know sobering up for for 6 to 8</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.990" end="00:43:28.220" style="s2">hours this keeps happening I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.090" end="00:43:30.320" style="s2">sorry about this everyone I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.220" end="00:43:32.090" style="s2">what to say about it except that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.320" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">a consequence of software updates I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.090" end="00:43:42.170" style="s2">suppose anyways so that made it</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.400" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">impossible because we just couldn&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.170" end="00:43:45.230" style="s2">people in the lab for that long all it</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:46.940" style="s2">did was annoy them to death and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.230" end="00:43:48.950" style="s2">they hated us and they you know people</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.940" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">would get quite irritable and upset and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.950" end="00:43:53.900" style="s2">no bloody wonder so then also and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:55.400" style="s2">triple-a decided that half our subjects</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.900" end="00:43:58.670" style="s2">had to be women or we couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.400" end="00:44:00.710" style="s2">funding well now our subjects couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.670" end="00:44:02.960" style="s2">be women it was impossible to do the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.710" end="00:44:04.370" style="s2">kind of research that we were doing with</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.960" end="00:44:07.820" style="s2">women for the reasons that I just</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.370" end="00:44:09.740" style="s2">outlined well first of all alcoholism</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.820" end="00:44:12.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t affect women as much as it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.740" end="00:44:14.570" style="s2">affects men depression and anxiety tend</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.740" end="00:44:15.980" style="s2">to affect women more and it&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.570" end="00:44:19.990" style="s2">reasonable to study those things but</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.980" end="00:44:22.730" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what we were doing and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.990" end="00:44:25.070" style="s2">then we couldn&#39;t do multi-generational</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.730" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">studies for for genetic predisposition</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.070" end="00:44:29.720" style="s2">with women because of the fetal alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:31.070" style="s2">syndrome problem and you know this was</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.720" end="00:44:34.100" style="s2">something I think this came in under the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.070" end="00:44:38.150" style="s2">Clintons this requirement for absolute</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.100" end="00:44:39.830" style="s2">gender equality in in subject selection</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.150" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t give a damn if that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.830" end="00:44:42.890" style="s2">meant that there were certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:45.080" style="s2">research that just couldn&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.890" end="00:44:47.300" style="s2">anymore and so I had to stop doing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.080" end="00:44:49.010" style="s2">and no one&#39;s really doing that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.300" end="00:44:51.320" style="s2">research anymore because it&#39;s just too</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.010" end="00:44:52.580" style="s2">difficult it&#39;s like it was always a pain</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.320" end="00:44:53.810" style="s2">because it was really hard to get the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.580" end="00:44:56.360" style="s2">subjects and then you had to get people</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.810" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">quite intoxicated and then you had to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.360" end="00:44:58.910" style="s2">deal with them when they were drunk and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:00.680" style="s2">you had to do your psychophysiological</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.910" end="00:45:02.540" style="s2">recording and all that sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.680" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">then they had to sober up and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.540" end="00:45:07.310" style="s2">it was complicated clinical research is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:09.110" style="s2">unbelievably unbelievably complicated</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.310" end="00:45:10.460" style="s2">and difficult and then you had like two</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.110" end="00:45:12.770" style="s2">more restrictions to it and people just</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.460" end="00:45:14.410" style="s2">go oh okay well we I guess we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.770" end="00:45:16.310" style="s2">study the psychophysiological</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.410" end="00:45:18.500" style="s2">consequences of alcohol anymore</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.310" end="00:45:19.300" style="s2">or so people would use low doses you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.500" end="00:45:21.070" style="s2">know and only get</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.300" end="00:45:22.690" style="s2">their subjects blood-alcohol level up to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.070" end="00:45:24.480" style="s2">like point O two or point O three but</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.690" end="00:45:26.260" style="s2">that&#39;s completely irrelevant because</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.480" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">alcohol doesn&#39;t have much of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.260" end="00:45:30.850" style="s2">physiological effect at those low doses</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:33.130" style="s2">and so well this is one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.850" end="00:45:34.420" style="s2">that made me absolutely despise ethics</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.130" end="00:45:36.100" style="s2">committees and I believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.420" end="00:45:38.110" style="s2">proliferation of ethics committees is</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.100" end="00:45:40.900" style="s2">one of the reasons that university</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.110" end="00:45:43.060" style="s2">research human research is is doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.900" end="00:45:44.620" style="s2">badly psychological research is doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.060" end="00:45:47.110" style="s2">badly there&#39;s a variety of reasons but</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.620" end="00:45:48.610" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly one of them so I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.110" end="00:45:49.930" style="s2">interested sorry this is a very long</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.610" end="00:45:51.790" style="s2">answer but I was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.930" end="00:45:53.290" style="s2">personality as well you know uh because</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.790" end="00:45:56.110" style="s2">I was a clinical psychologist and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.290" end="00:45:58.180" style="s2">read Freud and Jung and Adler and all</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.110" end="00:46:01.000" style="s2">the great clinicians of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.180" end="00:46:03.400" style="s2">and when I went to Harvard I was offered</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.000" end="00:46:06.190" style="s2">you know I when you&#39;re a new faculty</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.400" end="00:46:08.230" style="s2">member there&#39;s usually a set course that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.190" end="00:46:09.640" style="s2">they require you to teach that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.230" end="00:46:12.250" style="s2">the core courses and then you have some</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.640" end="00:46:14.920" style="s2">freedom with your other courses and so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.250" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">said I&#39;d teach personality and then I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.920" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">got more and more and we were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:20.830" style="s2">personality models with the alcoholism</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:22.510" style="s2">research - at that point the big five</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.830" end="00:46:24.100" style="s2">was starting to establish itself and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.510" end="00:46:26.500" style="s2">wasn&#39;t much of an admirer of the big</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.100" end="00:46:28.120" style="s2">five because I like well I like theories</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.500" end="00:46:30.100" style="s2">as well as empirical research and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.120" end="00:46:31.690" style="s2">thought the big five well there was just</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.100" end="00:46:36.490" style="s2">no theory at all it was just brute force</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.690" end="00:46:38.650" style="s2">empiricism but well but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.490" end="00:46:43.270" style="s2">data eventually became convincing and as</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.650" end="00:46:45.190" style="s2">I got more and more interested in in</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.270" end="00:46:47.560" style="s2">personality I got more and more</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.190" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">interested in the use of personality and</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.560" end="00:46:52.590" style="s2">other psychometric technologies to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:57.400" style="s2">predict things like academic and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.590" end="00:47:00.010" style="s2">creative success you see it at McGill my</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.400" end="00:47:03.310" style="s2">Bob and I and a variety of other people</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.010" end="00:47:05.080" style="s2">were using psychological tests of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.310" end="00:47:07.420" style="s2">various sorts to predict things like</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.080" end="00:47:08.890" style="s2">alcoholism and antisocial personality so</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.420" end="00:47:11.740" style="s2">we could use the big five and</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.890" end="00:47:14.110" style="s2">neuropsychological tests tests of dorsal</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.740" end="00:47:16.060" style="s2">lateral prefrontal function at least in</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.110" end="00:47:17.980" style="s2">principle to predict to some degree who</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.060" end="00:47:19.570" style="s2">might be susceptible to the development</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.980" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">of antisocial personality and then when</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.570" end="00:47:22.930" style="s2">I went to Harvard I thought well hey</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:25.270" style="s2">maybe we could use those tests to</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.930" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">predict who was going to be good at</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.270" end="00:47:28.690" style="s2">things as well as who was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:31.560" style="s2">bad you know the people who are creative</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.690" end="00:47:32.770" style="s2">or the people who were academically</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.560" end="00:47:34.360" style="s2">oates</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.770" end="00:47:35.740" style="s2">standing or people who did well as</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.360" end="00:47:37.660" style="s2">managers and administrators and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.740" end="00:47:39.060" style="s2">corporations might do well on</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.660" end="00:47:42.130" style="s2">personality tests and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.060" end="00:47:43.750" style="s2">neuropsychological tests that assess</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.130" end="00:47:45.490" style="s2">dorsal lateral prefrontal functions</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.750" end="00:47:47.080" style="s2">that&#39;s higher-order cognition so we</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.490" end="00:47:49.480" style="s2">started to put together tests batteries</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.080" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">that assess that and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.480" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">fascinating research I did that with</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:54.580" style="s2">Daniel Higgins who&#39;s the partner my</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:56.740" style="s2">partner in the development of the self</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.580" end="00:47:58.510" style="s2">authoring program and understand myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.740" end="00:48:00.220" style="s2">that things that he&#39;s labored for 20</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.510" end="00:48:04.120" style="s2">years on before they really became</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.220" end="00:48:07.090" style="s2">successful and he wrote a bang-up thesis</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.120" end="00:48:08.830" style="s2">I think it was the best thing ever</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.090" end="00:48:11.590" style="s2">written on this on the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.830" end="00:48:14.170" style="s2">intelligence and and launched that he</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.590" end="00:48:15.610" style="s2">started working on and in 1993 which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.170" end="00:48:17.590" style="s2">about the same time that the bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.610" end="00:48:19.570" style="s2">came out and so his research actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.590" end="00:48:21.070" style="s2">became relatively politically</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.570" end="00:48:23.610" style="s2">contentious even though all we were</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.070" end="00:48:28.510" style="s2">trying to do was trying to determine</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.610" end="00:48:30.790" style="s2">what attributes predicted success among</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.510" end="00:48:32.980" style="s2">creative people and among managers and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.790" end="00:48:34.660" style="s2">administrators in acting and Anika</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.980" end="00:48:36.760" style="s2">academia and so forth pure empirical</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.660" end="00:48:39.550" style="s2">research but it became we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.760" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">rapidly politicized anyways so I just</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.550" end="00:48:42.610" style="s2">got more and more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:45.100" style="s2">psychometrics partly because I realized</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.610" end="00:48:46.930" style="s2">way back when in 1993 that almost</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.100" end="00:48:49.000" style="s2">nothing that psychologists measured was</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.930" end="00:48:50.680" style="s2">actually real and so we were interested</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.000" end="00:48:53.320" style="s2">in what was real and Daniel is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.680" end="00:48:54.940" style="s2">engineer trained at MIT and so he was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.320" end="00:48:58.030" style="s2">very very metha</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.940" end="00:49:00.190" style="s2">method a methodical person and he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.030" end="00:49:02.560" style="s2">like to move ahead with his research at</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.190" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">all unless he had nailed absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.560" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">everything down in a way that only an</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:09.250" style="s2">engineer and a software coder would and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:11.160" style="s2">so we started working on personality</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.250" end="00:49:13.360" style="s2">models and I&#39;ve been doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.160" end="00:49:15.400" style="s2">concentrating on that more specifically</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.360" end="00:49:16.930" style="s2">ever since as well as writing the more</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.400" end="00:49:18.970" style="s2">theoretical material that was associated</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.930" end="00:49:23.100" style="s2">say with 12 rules for life and maps of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.970" end="00:49:26.110" style="s2">meaning so okay so that&#39;s that answer</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.100" end="00:49:28.090" style="s2">are you aware of any of your critics are</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.110" end="00:49:30.340" style="s2">you aware of any critics of your work</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.090" end="00:49:33.880" style="s2">who are deep and credible well of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.340" end="00:49:36.100" style="s2">not someone who had a minimum had read</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.880" end="00:49:40.990" style="s2">maps of meaning well it&#39;s a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.100" end="00:49:44.830" style="s2">question you know I&#39;ve never read a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.990" end="00:49:46.330" style="s2">critic of Jung who actually understood</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.830" end="00:49:48.340" style="s2">what um was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.330" end="00:49:50.320" style="s2">and I actually knew a number of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.340" end="00:49:52.450" style="s2">scientists including yoga panksepp who</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.320" end="00:49:55.000" style="s2">wrote affective neuroscience was a great</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.450" end="00:49:59.020" style="s2">book who is a real admirer of young and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.000" end="00:50:00.580" style="s2">and the psychoanalysts I mean panksepp</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.020" end="00:50:02.740" style="s2">was very interested in neuro psych</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.580" end="00:50:04.030" style="s2">analysis and most of the people many of</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.740" end="00:50:06.640" style="s2">the people who are interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.030" end="00:50:07.810" style="s2">half in the neuroscience of emotion were</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.640" end="00:50:09.910" style="s2">also very interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.810" end="00:50:11.860" style="s2">psychoanalytic types most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.910" end="00:50:13.810" style="s2">who criticized Jung don&#39;t have a clue</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.860" end="00:50:15.250" style="s2">what he was talking about and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.810" end="00:50:18.100" style="s2">surprising because he&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.250" end="00:50:21.370" style="s2">no I haven&#39;t come across a credible</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.100" end="00:50:24.670" style="s2">critic of maps of meaning and I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.370" end="00:50:27.070" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know I mean that may also be</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.670" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">because you know up until I became</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.070" end="00:50:34.180" style="s2">notorious let&#39;s say over the last couple</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:36.280" style="s2">of years it was it influential it did</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.180" end="00:50:39.490" style="s2">pretty well the book did pretty well for</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.280" end="00:50:40.810" style="s2">a an academic work it was no massive</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.490" end="00:50:42.910" style="s2">seller although it&#39;s hit the bestseller</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.810" end="00:50:45.610" style="s2">list now on in the audio version which i</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.910" end="00:50:47.380" style="s2">think is pretty amusing that&#39;s the New</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.610" end="00:50:50.520" style="s2">York Times bestseller list given that</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.380" end="00:50:53.380" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t list twelve rules for life</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.520" end="00:50:55.540" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if the lack of criticism</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.380" end="00:50:59.800" style="s2">is a consequence of its lack of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.540" end="00:51:02.590" style="s2">influence or its difficulty I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.800" end="00:51:04.060" style="s2">social psychologists talk to me a little</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.590" end="00:51:05.710" style="s2">bit about the ideas of maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.060" end="00:51:07.330" style="s2">and I tried to talk to them especially</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.710" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">the people are interested in such things</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.330" end="00:51:12.370" style="s2">as terror management but they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:13.840" style="s2">usually don&#39;t know the neuropsychology</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.370" end="00:51:15.790" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know the mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.840" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">there are very few people who are versed</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.790" end="00:51:19.840" style="s2">in the world of neuropsychology and in</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:21.490" style="s2">the world of mythology simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.840" end="00:51:23.770" style="s2">and I&#39;m drawing these parallels you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.490" end="00:51:27.370" style="s2">like and they&#39;re very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.770" end="00:51:29.470" style="s2">parallels so I made the assumption see I</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.370" end="00:51:31.780" style="s2">studied these Russian neuropsychologists</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.470" end="00:51:33.910" style="s2">Vinogradova and Sokolov who were</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.780" end="00:51:35.260" style="s2">students of Alexander Luria brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.910" end="00:51:37.570" style="s2">students and they discovered this</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.260" end="00:51:39.160" style="s2">phenomena called the orienting reflex</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.570" end="00:51:41.290" style="s2">which I wrote a lot about in maps of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.160" end="00:51:43.570" style="s2">meaning and the orienting reflex is your</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.290" end="00:51:47.230" style="s2">automatic response to what is unknown</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.570" end="00:51:48.730" style="s2">and you have a very deep automatic</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.230" end="00:51:51.070" style="s2">response to what is unknown and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.730" end="00:51:53.020" style="s2">really means that the unknown is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.070" end="00:51:55.840" style="s2">conceptual category and it was my</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.020" end="00:51:59.859" style="s2">proposition developed in maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.840" end="00:52:01.720" style="s2">that the unknown is a fundamental car</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.859" end="00:52:03.819" style="s2">of category or maybe even a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.720" end="00:52:06.329" style="s2">category of reality depending on how you</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.819" end="00:52:10.809" style="s2">define reality like I&#39;m defining reality</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.329" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">phenomenologically as experienced but as</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.809" end="00:52:14.109" style="s2">experienced universally and as</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:17.769" style="s2">experienced biologically by animals and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.109" end="00:52:19.539" style="s2">by human beings the unknown is something</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.769" end="00:52:21.099" style="s2">like unexplored territory and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.539" end="00:52:22.509" style="s2">reasonable to assume that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.099" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">fundamental distinction even</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.509" end="00:52:28.839" style="s2">neurologically between the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:30.670" style="s2">action that obtain in territories that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.839" end="00:52:32.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve thoroughly explored and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.670" end="00:52:34.029" style="s2">pattern of action that&#39;s necessary when</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.410" end="00:52:36.700" style="s2">you step outside the domain that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.029" end="00:52:39.940" style="s2">familiar with where your reaction as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.700" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">prey animal or perhaps as a predator has</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.940" end="00:52:44.140" style="s2">to become paramount and so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">fundamental proposition in maps of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.140" end="00:52:49.210" style="s2">meaning is something like the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:51.039" style="s2">the unknown that&#39;s reflexively responded</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.210" end="00:52:54.249" style="s2">to with the orienting reflex which is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.039" end="00:52:56.529" style="s2">very very fundamental reflex and basic</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.249" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">to the entire process of learning itself</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.529" end="00:53:02.950" style="s2">is reflected in our mythological</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:09.069" style="s2">representations and I think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.950" end="00:53:12.970" style="s2">a absolutely if that&#39;s true then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.069" end="00:53:15.130" style="s2">profound realization I wouldn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.970" end="00:53:17.109" style="s2">say discovery because I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.130" end="00:53:18.940" style="s2">you bring two literature&#39;s together that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.109" end="00:53:20.920" style="s2">have never been conjoined if that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.940" end="00:53:24.609" style="s2">constitutes a discovery but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.920" end="00:53:28.809" style="s2">certainly never found anyone who was</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.609" end="00:53:31.809" style="s2">able to suggest to me any reason why I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.809" end="00:53:33.220" style="s2">should assume that that hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.809" end="00:53:34.779" style="s2">incorrect you know when I&#39;ve had pretty</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.220" end="00:53:36.609" style="s2">damn bright graduate students and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.779" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">they&#39;ve gone off to be credible</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.609" end="00:53:40.809" style="s2">professors and most of them have</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:42.700" style="s2">maintained that viewpoint and I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.809" end="00:53:48.940" style="s2">Colin DeYoung is probably foremost among</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.700" end="00:53:51.849" style="s2">them so you know it would be nice</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.940" end="00:53:54.460" style="s2">actually if if I could encounter critics</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.849" end="00:53:56.529" style="s2">of maps of meaning who were credible</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.460" end="00:54:01.029" style="s2">because I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some things in</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.529" end="00:54:02.559" style="s2">it that I wrote that were wrong and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.029" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they are I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.559" end="00:54:07.450" style="s2">been thinking about the damn book since</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:09.339" style="s2">1982 and I&#39;ve been thinking about it a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.450" end="00:54:10.930" style="s2">lot and my work in 12 rules for life is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.339" end="00:54:11.750" style="s2">an extension of what I did in maps a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.930" end="00:54:14.060" style="s2">meaning but</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.750" end="00:54:15.530" style="s2">I can&#39;t see holes in it and nothing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.060" end="00:54:17.600" style="s2">learned since then and that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.530" end="00:54:21.140" style="s2">consequence of my own stupidity but in</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.600" end="00:54:23.960" style="s2">narrow-mindedness is I haven&#39;t seen any</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.140" end="00:54:25.970" style="s2">reason to radically revise the</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.960" end="00:54:30.140" style="s2">propositions that I put forth in maps of</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.140" end="00:54:34.400" style="s2">the idea that and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.970" end="00:54:36.170" style="s2">actually more evidence now that the</p>

<p begin="00:54:36.170" end="00:54:39.890" style="s2">were when I wrote the book originally</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.970" end="00:54:43.030" style="s2">the idea for example that our</p>

<p begin="00:56:55.250" end="00:57:00.380" style="s2">and but there isn&#39;t anything really</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.250" end="00:57:02.120" style="s2">exciting I can report about that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.380" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">they were all preliminary discussions of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.120" end="00:57:06.260" style="s2">a sort to see if we could get along and</p>

<p begin="00:57:09.050" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">headway with this university project</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.200" end="00:57:15.920" style="s2">although we don&#39;t really conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:18.320" style="s2">it as a university project anymore we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.920" end="00:57:21.560" style="s2">conceptualizing it as a adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.320" end="00:57:24.590" style="s2">learning system and we&#39;re trying to use</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.560" end="00:57:27.020" style="s2">it to index people&#39;s no index knowledge</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.940" end="00:57:36.860" style="s2">how its generated and to accredit people</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.280" end="00:57:38.750" style="s2">properly and we&#39;ll relief release more</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.860" end="00:57:40.790" style="s2">information about that in the upcoming</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.750" end="00:57:42.680" style="s2">months as we move closer and closer to a</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.790" end="00:57:44.450" style="s2">functional prototype the plan at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.680" end="00:57:47.720" style="s2">moment I&#39;ve talked to lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.450" end="00:57:49.820" style="s2">like Andrea sand until who are very</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.720" end="00:57:51.620" style="s2">interested in technology and education</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.820" end="00:57:53.840" style="s2">and who also are very well capitalized</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.620" end="00:57:56.210" style="s2">and have had the opportunity multiple</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.840" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">times to pull in investors into this</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.210" end="00:58:00.860" style="s2">educational project but I haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:03.260" style="s2">that partly because weirdly enough you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.860" end="00:58:05.420" style="s2">know you think money is a solution to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.260" end="00:58:06.920" style="s2">problem but it&#39;s also it&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.420" end="00:58:09.380" style="s2">problem in and of itself and if I</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.920" end="00:58:13.400" style="s2">generated several million dollars let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.380" end="00:58:15.110" style="s2">say to fund this educational endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.400" end="00:58:17.000" style="s2">then I would not only have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.110" end="00:58:18.350" style="s2">about how to design the educational</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.000" end="00:58:20.210" style="s2">system but then I&#39;d have to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.350" end="00:58:22.340" style="s2">how to spend that money and Shepherd</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.210" end="00:58:24.380" style="s2">that money intelligently and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.340" end="00:58:26.930" style="s2">actually a huge administrative problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.380" end="00:58:29.690" style="s2">of sufficient magnitude to stop you from</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.930" end="00:58:31.460" style="s2">doing any creative thinking at all so</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.690" end="00:58:33.830" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing instead is I&#39;m funding</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.460" end="00:58:35.750" style="s2">the university project at the moment or</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.830" end="00:58:39.670" style="s2">the online education project as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.750" end="00:58:39.670" style="s2">consequence of my patreon funding</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.890" end="00:59:02.620" style="s2">ha fix that in about five seconds this</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.400" end="00:59:04.510" style="s2">time so I&#39;m funding that from my patreon</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.620" end="00:59:07.090" style="s2">donations and I like that model better</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.510" end="00:59:08.710" style="s2">the only problem is is that I would like</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.090" end="00:59:10.450" style="s2">to offer the people that I have as</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.710" end="00:59:13.210" style="s2">employees a certain amount of financial</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.450" end="00:59:15.400" style="s2">stability and so and you know it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.210" end="00:59:16.900" style="s2">obvious to me how stable the patreon</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.400" end="00:59:19.210" style="s2">funding is although it&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.900" end="00:59:21.250" style="s2">stable so far but you know who knows how</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.210" end="00:59:24.700" style="s2">that will work out so I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.250" end="00:59:27.490" style="s2">going to do is to crowdfund in October</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.700" end="00:59:30.220" style="s2">or November once we have a minimal</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.490" end="00:59:32.020" style="s2">Viable Product and I I think I&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.220" end="00:59:34.150" style="s2">do that and raise money privately</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.020" end="00:59:37.510" style="s2">anyways because I don&#39;t want this</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.150" end="00:59:40.240" style="s2">project to be beholden to anyone and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.510" end="00:59:41.740" style="s2">want to maintain control over its</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.240" end="00:59:43.480" style="s2">direction with a small group of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.740" end="00:59:45.370" style="s2">programmers you know it&#39;s often a small</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.480" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">group of people who are working tightly</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.370" end="00:59:48.370" style="s2">together that solve very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:50.230" style="s2">problems and that&#39;s certainly been the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.370" end="00:59:52.210" style="s2">case with working say with Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.230" end="00:59:54.520" style="s2">Higgins and Robert Peel on the self</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.210" end="00:59:56.740" style="s2">authoring programs and so forth a small</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.520" end="00:59:58.570" style="s2">team we we&#39;ve thought about going the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.740" end="01:00:00.370" style="s2">venture capital route and expanding and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.570" end="01:00:02.800" style="s2">trying to make a big business out of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.370" end="01:00:04.330" style="s2">but our sense was more that it would</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.800" end="01:00:05.590" style="s2">maybe we were wrong about this but that</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.330" end="01:00:07.600" style="s2">was better to go directly after</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.590" end="01:00:09.970" style="s2">customers and to build the business</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.600" end="01:00:12.730" style="s2">incrementally and to test it along each</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.970" end="01:00:15.510" style="s2">step and not to get enticed by the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.730" end="01:00:20.380" style="s2">possibility of unicorn level money and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.510" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">so anyways that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.380" end="01:00:25.080" style="s2">situation there and I&#39;ve got three</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:28.870" style="s2">really bright people working on this</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.080" end="01:00:30.280" style="s2">open educational platform and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.870" end="01:00:32.650" style="s2">really quite exciting and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.280" end="01:00:34.870" style="s2">we&#39;re well ahead of schedule from where</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.650" end="01:00:37.110" style="s2">I thought we would be so that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.870" end="01:00:39.550" style="s2">cool have you spoken to Nassim Taleb</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.110" end="01:00:41.230" style="s2">following your brief twitter exchange</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.550" end="01:00:42.850" style="s2">would love to hear a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.230" end="01:00:44.230" style="s2">the two of you I&#39;d like to talk to him</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.850" end="01:00:47.500" style="s2">too because he&#39;s very very smart</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.230" end="01:00:49.360" style="s2">he&#39;s uh he&#39;s touchy though and so I have</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.500" end="01:00:50.950" style="s2">some apprehension about that I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.360" end="01:00:52.510" style="s2">to lots of touchy people over the last</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.950" end="01:00:53.830" style="s2">couple of years and I&#39;m a bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.510" end="01:00:55.780" style="s2">apprehensive about it but I would like</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.830" end="01:00:59.020" style="s2">to do that a lot of people I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.780" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">talk to he&#39;s one of them and and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.020" end="01:01:02.350" style="s2">know it&#39;s I&#39;m having a hard time setting</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">up those conversations at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.350" end="01:01:07.240" style="s2">because I&#39;m doing so much touring I am</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:08.830" style="s2">talking again to jonathan height the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.240" end="01:01:11.650" style="s2">in the near future and I think probably</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.830" end="01:01:15.250" style="s2">to Steven Pinker as well and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.650" end="01:01:18.070" style="s2">for those of you who are wondering I am</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.250" end="01:01:20.820" style="s2">going to release thee and so is Sam</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.070" end="01:01:25.150" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna release the videos from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.820" end="01:01:26.859" style="s2">Sam Harris Peterson debates I&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.150" end="01:01:28.810" style="s2">them on my youtube channel Sam will put</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.859" end="01:01:30.849" style="s2">them on his will make them into podcasts</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.810" end="01:01:34.690" style="s2">as well I&#39;m going to release the first</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.849" end="01:01:37.240" style="s2">one on September 1st and and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.690" end="01:01:39.010" style="s2">will have access to it it&#39;s taken us a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.240" end="01:01:41.020" style="s2">while to figure out exactly how to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.010" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2">this partly because Travis Pangburn who</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.020" end="01:01:46.570" style="s2">hosted the events wanted to raise some</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">money with the videos at least in part</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.570" end="01:01:50.800" style="s2">to help offset the costs that he</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:53.080" style="s2">incurred for those events which were</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.800" end="01:01:55.540" style="s2">very expensive believe it or not and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.080" end="01:02:01.710" style="s2">difficult to generate a profit for from</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.540" end="01:02:04.240" style="s2">on his end and also he wants to</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.710" end="01:02:06.339" style="s2">translate the material that he already</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.240" end="01:02:08.980" style="s2">has into multiple languages so we agreed</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.339" end="01:02:10.390" style="s2">to let him win we had to make a</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.980" end="01:02:11.890" style="s2">three-way agreement for this you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.390" end="01:02:13.869" style="s2">because Sam was involved and I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.890" end="01:02:15.970" style="s2">involved and so was Pangburn and so and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.869" end="01:02:17.440" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know how the events would go</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.970" end="01:02:19.270" style="s2">you know so we weren&#39;t actually that</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.440" end="01:02:22.330" style="s2">concerned with the damn videos to begin</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.270" end="01:02:24.940" style="s2">with because we take we we&#39;d taken a</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.330" end="01:02:26.320" style="s2">risk I&#39;m not complaining about this by</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.940" end="01:02:28.420" style="s2">the way like I&#39;m not complaining about</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.320" end="01:02:30.190" style="s2">taking a risk but we didn&#39;t Sam and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.420" end="01:02:31.570" style="s2">hadn&#39;t even met you know we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.190" end="01:02:32.740" style="s2">if we were gonna have conversations that</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.570" end="01:02:34.599" style="s2">were worthwhile we didn&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.740" end="01:02:36.430" style="s2">anybody would show up for the events and</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.599" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">so we were way more concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.430" end="01:02:39.130" style="s2">whether or not we&#39;d get a crowd of any</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:40.390" style="s2">sort whether the events would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.130" end="01:02:43.540" style="s2">successful and whether we could actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.390" end="01:02:46.030" style="s2">talk then what we would do with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.540" end="01:02:48.190" style="s2">videos if the or even if there would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.030" end="01:02:50.290" style="s2">videos if the events were successful and</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.190" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">so it turned out that we couldn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.290" end="01:02:54.520" style="s2">and we did have useful discussions at</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.480" end="01:02:56.680" style="s2">least we thought so and the audience&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.520" end="01:02:58.540" style="s2">responded very well and there was large</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.680" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">crowds and so it was successful so then</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.540" end="01:03:02.520" style="s2">it turned out that the videos were</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:05.560" style="s2">worthwhile but we hadn&#39;t discussed who</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.520" end="01:03:06.940" style="s2">had control over the videos or who was</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.560" end="01:03:09.010" style="s2">going to edit them or any of those</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.940" end="01:03:11.050" style="s2">things that we had to do that post talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.010" end="01:03:14.020" style="s2">after the fact which isn&#39;t the best way</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.050" end="01:03:15.670" style="s2">of doing it and then it took Travis a</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.020" end="01:03:18.160" style="s2">while to assemble a team to do the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.670" end="01:03:20.530" style="s2">actual editing and so that was our</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.160" end="01:03:20.829" style="s2">compromise and you know it would have</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.530" end="01:03:23.049" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.829" end="01:03:24.999" style="s2">if we could have released the videos and</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.049" end="01:03:27.519" style="s2">all of that immediately after the talks</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.999" end="01:03:29.469" style="s2">but you know when you&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.519" end="01:03:30.940" style="s2">new and you don&#39;t know exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.469" end="01:03:33.729" style="s2">you&#39;re doing you&#39;re not going to do it</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.940" end="01:03:36.430" style="s2">perfectly and so we didn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.729" end="01:03:38.529" style="s2">perfectly but the events were good and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.430" end="01:03:40.479" style="s2">enjoyed talking to Sam and I learned a</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.529" end="01:03:42.309" style="s2">lot from the discussion I really had to</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.479" end="01:03:44.170" style="s2">sharpen my thinking I really figured out</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.309" end="01:03:47.499" style="s2">something you know I figured out that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.170" end="01:03:49.539" style="s2">think the fundamental issue here is how</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.499" end="01:03:53.380" style="s2">you take the infinite world of facts</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.539" end="01:03:55.479" style="s2">that presents itself to you independent</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.380" end="01:03:57.640" style="s2">of the value of those facts so value</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.479" end="01:04:00.039" style="s2">neutral thoughts and they have to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.640" end="01:04:01.989" style="s2">filtered to a single point like a single</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.039" end="01:04:03.489" style="s2">point of perception because you have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.989" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">point your eyes at one thing and your</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.489" end="01:04:06.969" style="s2">attention at one thing and a single</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:09.849" style="s2">point of action and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.969" end="01:04:13.359" style="s2">tremendous reducing of the world of fact</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.849" end="01:04:15.999" style="s2">to the extraordinarily simple and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:20.349" style="s2">targeted rule of veil or world of value</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.999" end="01:04:22.209" style="s2">and your your brain is the instrument</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.349" end="01:04:24.700" style="s2">that does that reducing and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.209" end="01:04:26.829" style="s2">it&#39;s in keeping with Aldous Huxley&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.700" end="01:04:29.890" style="s2">suppositions about and that and they</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.829" end="01:04:31.660" style="s2">were motivated by honoré Bergesen the</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.890" end="01:04:33.489" style="s2">idea that the brain was a reducing valve</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.660" end="01:04:34.890" style="s2">and that what psychedelic experience did</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.489" end="01:04:36.940" style="s2">was open the doors of perception</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.890" end="01:04:39.549" style="s2">something William Blake also talked</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.940" end="01:04:42.279" style="s2">about the brain seems to be in some</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.549" end="01:04:44.259" style="s2">sense the part of the structure that</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.279" end="01:04:47.349" style="s2">reduces the infinite complexity of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.259" end="01:04:49.059" style="s2">world of facts to the finite and single</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.349" end="01:04:51.339" style="s2">point domain of world of values and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.059" end="01:04:53.559" style="s2">that&#39;s partly neurologically</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.339" end="01:04:55.239" style="s2">instantiated and partly sociologically</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.559" end="01:04:56.769" style="s2">instantiated becomes we come to a</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.239" end="01:04:59.199" style="s2">negotiated agreement about what</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.769" end="01:05:01.089" style="s2">constitutes value just like we do about</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.199" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">what constitutes value economically and</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.089" end="01:05:07.779" style="s2">so the structure that reduces facts to</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:10.119" style="s2">values is a reducing structure that</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.779" end="01:05:12.519" style="s2">simultaneously instantiate instantiated</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.119" end="01:05:13.900" style="s2">neurologically and sociologically and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.519" end="01:05:15.729" style="s2">understand that a lot more clearly</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.900" end="01:05:17.349" style="s2">because I had these discussions with Sam</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.729" end="01:05:20.680" style="s2">and I&#39;m writing a lot about that in this</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.349" end="01:05:22.690" style="s2">next book which is it&#39;s a follow up I</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.680" end="01:05:25.089" style="s2">suspect that&#39;s the plan at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.690" end="01:05:27.459" style="s2">212 rules for life because I had written</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.089" end="01:05:29.410" style="s2">originally 40 rules so I have more to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.459" end="01:05:31.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve written about half the new book and</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.410" end="01:05:33.480" style="s2">I spent a lot of time writing about at</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.900" end="01:05:35.700" style="s2">least in part when I</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.480" end="01:05:37.590" style="s2">to become clear about as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.700" end="01:05:39.900" style="s2">of my discussions with Harris and so I</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.590" end="01:05:41.670" style="s2">took a look at the videos and I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.900" end="01:05:43.380" style="s2">the debates were productive and and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.670" end="01:05:45.630" style="s2">audience&#39;s seemed to find them so and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.380" end="01:05:47.400" style="s2">certainly Sam and I did I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.630" end="01:05:48.990" style="s2">meeting him we got along quite well he</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.400" end="01:05:51.510" style="s2">has much better sense of humor than I</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.990" end="01:05:53.280" style="s2">presumed from listening well from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.510" end="01:05:54.930" style="s2">two podcasts we did of course I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.280" end="01:05:59.490" style="s2">in great humor when I did those either</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.930" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">and you know I also think that I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.490" end="01:06:05.940" style="s2">what would you say a fan of Sam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:07.530" style="s2">motivation or at least as far as I could</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.940" end="01:06:09.359" style="s2">determine it I mean he wants to ground</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.530" end="01:06:11.869" style="s2">the world of value in something that</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.359" end="01:06:14.940" style="s2">isn&#39;t merely arbitrary revelation and</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.869" end="01:06:18.180" style="s2">fair enough man that&#39;s a good that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.940" end="01:06:21.119" style="s2">good aim to ground ethics in something</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.180" end="01:06:23.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s solid and not just arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.119" end="01:06:26.010" style="s2">opinion but I think that the Devils in</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.640" end="01:06:31.470" style="s2">the details and so that&#39;s basically what</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.010" end="01:06:33.540" style="s2">we discussed so how do you reconcile</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.470" end="01:06:35.160" style="s2">studies that show genetics superseding</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.540" end="01:06:36.780" style="s2">environment in life outcomes with your</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.160" end="01:06:41.010" style="s2">own experience conducting successful</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.780" end="01:06:44.850" style="s2">psychotherapy yeah well I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.010" end="01:06:47.040" style="s2">one thing man that I really did come to</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.850" end="01:06:48.660" style="s2">realize more and more in the last three</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.040" end="01:06:50.310" style="s2">or four years partly I would say from</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.660" end="01:06:53.280" style="s2">dealing with my own health problems to</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.310" end="01:06:56.820" style="s2">some degree but also watching the health</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.280" end="01:06:59.250" style="s2">problems that my daughter had I think a</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.820" end="01:07:02.760" style="s2">lot of what we think of as mental</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.250" end="01:07:05.850" style="s2">illness is physical illness it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.760" end="01:07:07.440" style="s2">more than we think even but and I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.850" end="01:07:13.680" style="s2">that that is reflected in the genetic</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.440" end="01:07:16.080" style="s2">studies but I also think I also still</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.680" end="01:07:19.619" style="s2">think that that doesn&#39;t eliminate the</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.080" end="01:07:21.330" style="s2">role of learning you know people</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.619" end="01:07:23.220" style="s2">obviously learn and they can learn</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.330" end="01:07:25.619" style="s2">better or worse and they learn better</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.220" end="01:07:27.300" style="s2">when they voluntary voluntarily approach</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.619" end="01:07:28.380" style="s2">things that are frightening and</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.300" end="01:07:33.180" style="s2">threatening and they challenge</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.380" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">themselves and so it&#39;s made me more</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.180" end="01:07:37.859" style="s2">humble I would say in some sense both as</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:40.020" style="s2">a person and as a psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.859" end="01:07:42.960" style="s2">because I&#39;m more attuned to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.020" end="01:07:44.820" style="s2">that the apparently psychological</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.960" end="01:07:46.859" style="s2">difficulties that my clients might be</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.820" end="01:07:47.390" style="s2">experiencing may be a consequence of an</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.859" end="01:07:49.770" style="s2">under</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.390" end="01:07:52.950" style="s2">destabilization of physical health I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.770" end="01:07:54.300" style="s2">really unwilling to discount that even</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.950" end="01:07:56.670" style="s2">if what they&#39;re experiencing is very</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.300" end="01:07:59.120" style="s2">idiosyncratic but it still seems to me</p>

<p begin="01:10:54.670" end="01:10:57.420" style="s2">see how I can do</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.770" end="01:11:07.739" style="s2">you could think about this from the</p>

<p begin="01:11:07.739" end="01:11:15.219" style="s2">so imagine that what you confront what</p>

<p begin="01:11:15.219" end="01:11:20.440" style="s2">is what is unknowable and what is</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.800" end="01:11:22.980" style="s2">unknowable has an intrinsic meaning it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.440" end="01:11:26.190" style="s2">both frightening and compelling</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.980" end="01:11:30.520" style="s2">simultaneously it activates predator</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.190" end="01:11:32.380" style="s2">detection systems that protect you in</p>

<p begin="01:11:32.380" end="01:11:36.159" style="s2">by freezing and withdrawal and that sort</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.449" end="01:11:39.639" style="s2">of thing but it also makes you curious</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.159" end="01:11:41.590" style="s2">so that which you do not understand</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.639" end="01:11:43.989" style="s2">which is something that you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.590" end="01:11:47.050" style="s2">conceptualize as that which has not yet</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.989" end="01:11:51.550" style="s2">been made habitable world has an</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.050" end="01:11:54.039" style="s2">intrinsic meaning now the question is</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.550" end="01:11:57.309" style="s2">whether the fundamental stuff of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.039" end="01:12:00.780" style="s2">world is that meaningful unknown or</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.309" end="01:12:04.929" style="s2">something material you can make the case</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.780" end="01:12:10.329" style="s2">that what we recognize as material is</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.929" end="01:12:14.289" style="s2">actually a pragmatic reconceptualization</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.329" end="01:12:18.880" style="s2">of the meaning of the ambivalent meaning</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.289" end="01:12:20.949" style="s2">of the unknowable now I know that that</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.880" end="01:12:24.219" style="s2">that&#39;s hard that&#39;s a hard concept but</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.949" end="01:12:26.139" style="s2">imagine you see it depends on whether or</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.219" end="01:12:30.210" style="s2">not you believe that our descriptions of</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.139" end="01:12:33.329" style="s2">material reality are the superordinate</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.210" end="01:12:36.360" style="s2">descriptions of reality or whether our</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.329" end="01:12:40.570" style="s2">conceptualization of material is</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.360" end="01:12:43.869" style="s2">actually a form of pragmatic tool use</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.570" end="01:12:45.639" style="s2">that&#39;s oriented towards our survival and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.869" end="01:12:47.050" style="s2">this is not an easy thing to sort out</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.639" end="01:12:49.860" style="s2">it&#39;s something that I did try to sort</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.050" end="01:12:52.780" style="s2">out to some degree with Sam you know is</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.860" end="01:12:54.730" style="s2">do we have an objective description of</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.780" end="01:12:56.650" style="s2">reality and is reality something that</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.730" end="01:13:00.539" style="s2">can be objectively described or are we</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.650" end="01:13:03.329" style="s2">using a technology that produces</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.539" end="01:13:06.159" style="s2">so-called objective representations to</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.329" end="01:13:08.139" style="s2">facilitate our tool use it&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.159" end="01:13:10.449" style="s2">question right because obviously our</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.139" end="01:13:12.789" style="s2">advanced technology which we use in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.449" end="01:13:14.719" style="s2">tool like fashion is a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.789" end="01:13:17.659" style="s2">our materialists</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.719" end="01:13:19.820" style="s2">which begs the question is the science</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.659" end="01:13:22.429" style="s2">is the fundamental purpose of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.820" end="01:13:24.559" style="s2">science descriptive or pragmatic now I</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.429" end="01:13:26.659" style="s2">think I tend to think it&#39;s pragmatic</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.559" end="01:13:30.380" style="s2">because I think our fundamental problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.659" end="01:13:33.110" style="s2">is a problem of survival so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.380" end="01:13:36.019" style="s2">way of looking at the world where the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.110" end="01:13:38.900" style="s2">fundamental reality is the chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.019" end="01:13:40.639" style="s2">potential that gives rise to fear and</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.900" end="01:13:42.590" style="s2">curiosity and that&#39;s how your nervous</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.639" end="01:13:44.269" style="s2">system responds by the way and see</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.590" end="01:13:46.519" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting to me because I would</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.269" end="01:13:50.179" style="s2">say well it&#39;s a truism of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.519" end="01:13:52.039" style="s2">biology that what your nervous system is</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.179" end="01:13:53.719" style="s2">adapted to what you&#39;re adapted to as a</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.039" end="01:13:56.449" style="s2">consequence of your 3 and a half billion</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.719" end="01:13:58.489" style="s2">years of evolution is reality and that</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.449" end="01:14:01.340" style="s2">there&#39;s no other real way of defining it</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.489" end="01:14:05.090" style="s2">and so the way your brain construes</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.340" end="01:14:07.729" style="s2">reality is as if what you&#39;re confronting</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.090" end="01:14:10.249" style="s2">is an indeterminate chaotic potential</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.729" end="01:14:12.579" style="s2">that first generates something like</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.249" end="01:14:15.079" style="s2">apprehension fear and curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.579" end="01:14:16.789" style="s2">secondarily the apprehension to freeze</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.079" end="01:14:19.130" style="s2">you so that you don&#39;t get eaten or</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.789" end="01:14:22.280" style="s2">destroyed and the curiosity to allow you</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.130" end="01:14:24.439" style="s2">to engage with what&#39;s unknown and to</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.280" end="01:14:27.369" style="s2">transform it into habitable territory</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.439" end="01:14:32.269" style="s2">which in large part consists of tools</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.369" end="01:14:34.669" style="s2">now the onus mundus that pauly and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.269" end="01:14:38.079" style="s2">talked about seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.669" end="01:14:41.419" style="s2">associated with this idea of that</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.079" end="01:14:43.880" style="s2">chaotic potential and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.419" end="01:14:46.459" style="s2">related to the physicists wheelers</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.880" end="01:14:48.789" style="s2">proposition that the fundamental reality</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.459" end="01:14:53.530" style="s2">of the world is information rather than</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.789" end="01:14:55.999" style="s2">material that material is a secondary</p>

<p begin="01:14:55.999" end="01:15:01.999" style="s2">manifestation of information and I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.329" end="01:15:03.829" style="s2">that what we confront in the world see I</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.999" end="01:15:06.469" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;re driven by the past and</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.829" end="01:15:09.499" style="s2">or determined by the present I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.469" end="01:15:11.269" style="s2">what we do is we apprehend the potential</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.499" end="01:15:13.959" style="s2">of the future the chaotic potential of</p>

<p begin="01:15:27.230" end="01:15:33.410" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.800" end="01:15:36.590" style="s2">a toe huva bohu which is the chaotic</p>

<p begin="01:15:43.040" end="01:15:47.630" style="s2">I think that that capability</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.040" end="01:15:51.170" style="s2">characterizes us and so the onus mundus</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.630" end="01:15:53.510" style="s2">is the informational substrate that</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.170" end="01:15:55.970" style="s2">constitutes the world before it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:15:57.770" end="01:16:01.820" style="s2">consciousness and material so there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:16:07.510" end="01:16:13.790" style="s2">division unity of reality and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.420" end="01:16:16.310" style="s2">something like the toe huva bohu or the</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.790" end="01:16:18.920" style="s2">tail which is etymologically cognate by</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.310" end="01:16:21.910" style="s2">the way with the word Tiamat and Tiamat</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.920" end="01:16:25.610" style="s2">is the goddess that the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.910" end="01:16:28.010" style="s2">creator god Marduk confronted and cut</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.610" end="01:16:29.390" style="s2">into pieces and made the world from so</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.010" end="01:16:32.800" style="s2">that&#39;s all outlined in maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.390" end="01:16:34.760" style="s2">although not so much the onus Mundus</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.800" end="01:16:36.410" style="s2">hypothesis you know and I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.760" end="01:16:37.550" style="s2">thought about that for I wrote about it</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.410" end="01:16:38.690" style="s2">but these are in papers I never</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.550" end="01:16:40.820" style="s2">published because they were too damn</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.690" end="01:16:43.720" style="s2">complicated and I tried to publish them</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.820" end="01:16:43.720" style="s2">a couple of times with people</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.790" end="01:17:04.680" style="s2">but people didn&#39;t understand what I was</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.040" end="01:17:08.540" style="s2">talking about and you know I hadn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.680" end="01:17:08.540" style="s2">thought about oh man</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.039" end="01:17:29.340" style="s2">okay well here&#39;s a weird thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.840" end="01:18:06.409" style="s2">all right well the rate at which my</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.010" end="01:18:09.190" style="s2">camera equipment is crashing seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.409" end="01:18:13.090" style="s2">accelerating so it appears that</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.190" end="01:18:15.260" style="s2">discussion of the onus mundus is</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.090" end="01:18:17.179" style="s2">irritating the structure of reality in</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.260" end="01:18:19.580" style="s2">some manner anyways let&#39;s get back to it</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.179" end="01:18:21.349" style="s2">for a minute so this is a different way</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.580" end="01:18:23.780" style="s2">of conceptualizing the world I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.349" end="01:18:25.639" style="s2">it&#39;s a phenomenological perspective so</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.780" end="01:18:29.090" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what to make of it so</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.639" end="01:18:31.940" style="s2">think about it this way so it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.090" end="01:18:33.469" style="s2">your left hemisphere is specialized for</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.940" end="01:18:35.599" style="s2">operation and territory that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.469" end="01:18:37.389" style="s2">understand so it&#39;s specialized for</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.599" end="01:18:39.409" style="s2">operation in those places where</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.389" end="01:18:41.960" style="s2">behavioral patterns have been made</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.409" end="01:18:44.719" style="s2">habitual and explicit whereas the right</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.960" end="01:18:47.960" style="s2">hemisphere is specialized for response</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.719" end="01:18:51.199" style="s2">to chaos itself to the unknown and what</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.960" end="01:18:52.730" style="s2">that implies is that the division that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.199" end="01:18:54.770" style="s2">expressed for example in the yin-yang</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.730" end="01:18:57.860" style="s2">symbol which is essentially chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.770" end="01:18:59.090" style="s2">order is actually actually represents</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.860" end="01:19:01.130" style="s2">something fundamental about the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.090" end="01:19:02.510" style="s2">structure of reality now you might say</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.130" end="01:19:04.909" style="s2">well only the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.510" end="01:19:07.010" style="s2">insofar as biological organisms</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.909" end="01:19:08.270" style="s2">conceptualize it but I don&#39;t know if we</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.010" end="01:19:11.239" style="s2">can talk about the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.270" end="01:19:12.889" style="s2">outside the conceptions of biological</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.239" end="01:19:15.139" style="s2">organisms like if you&#39;re a strict</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.889" end="01:19:17.150" style="s2">believer in objective material reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.139" end="01:19:19.099" style="s2">in that transcendent existence of strict</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.150" end="01:19:20.630" style="s2">material reality then you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.099" end="01:19:23.119" style="s2">of course you could talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.630" end="01:19:24.710" style="s2">because strict material reality exists</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.119" end="01:19:26.690" style="s2">in the absence of biology and</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.710" end="01:19:30.170" style="s2">consciousness but it isn&#39;t so obvious to</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.690" end="01:19:32.330" style="s2">me that material reality does exist</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.170" end="01:19:34.940" style="s2">in the absence of consciousness because</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.330" end="01:19:36.349" style="s2">I can&#39;t conceptualize what existence</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.940" end="01:19:38.330" style="s2">would mean in the absence of</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.349" end="01:19:41.239" style="s2">consciousness like is there time is</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.330" end="01:19:43.280" style="s2">there duration is there sighs maybe all</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.239" end="01:19:45.020" style="s2">of these things are relative in some</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.280" end="01:19:47.239" style="s2">sense all of these things presuppose a</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.020" end="01:19:50.119" style="s2">conscious observer even in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.239" end="01:19:53.869" style="s2">materialist description so it looks to</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.119" end="01:19:55.880" style="s2">me like what reality is is this unas</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.869" end="01:19:58.489" style="s2">mundus that jung and Polly were pointing</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.880" end="01:20:00.560" style="s2">to its chaotic potential now I also</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.489" end="01:20:04.040" style="s2">think that we treat each other that way</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.560" end="01:20:06.080" style="s2">so if I&#39;m treating you properly then I</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.040" end="01:20:07.730" style="s2">treat you as if you&#39;re a moral agent</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.080" end="01:20:10.460" style="s2">who&#39;s actively engaged in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.730" end="01:20:13.190" style="s2">transformation of the chaotic potential</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.460" end="01:20:14.989" style="s2">that manifests itself as the dawning of</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.190" end="01:20:16.730" style="s2">the future and that attracts your</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.989" end="01:20:18.890" style="s2">attention I treat you as if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.730" end="01:20:21.230" style="s2">act of moral engage an act of moral</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.890" end="01:20:23.480" style="s2">agent engaged in making the moral</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.230" end="01:20:25.550" style="s2">decisions that determine how that</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.480" end="01:20:27.530" style="s2">potential is going to manifest itself</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.550" end="01:20:29.719" style="s2">and if I don&#39;t treat you that way</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.530" end="01:20:32.750" style="s2">then I&#39;m patronizing I don&#39;t give you</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.719" end="01:20:35.660" style="s2">your full I don&#39;t grant you your full</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.750" end="01:20:39.680" style="s2">stature as an as a sovereign being</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.660" end="01:20:42.260" style="s2">and I impinge upon your debt at your</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.680" end="01:20:46.370" style="s2">intrinsic value the same value that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.260" end="01:20:48.469" style="s2">allows you to claim the existence of</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.370" end="01:20:50.810" style="s2">natural rights and and also the presence</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.469" end="01:20:53.510" style="s2">I would say of natural responsibility so</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.810" end="01:20:55.640" style="s2">I treat you as if you are well I would</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.510" end="01:20:58.700" style="s2">say made in the image of God in the</p>

<p begin="01:20:58.700" end="01:21:06.320" style="s2">the process that turns the Tohu I bow</p>

<p begin="01:21:06.320" end="01:21:11.480" style="s2">habitable order and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.200" end="01:21:13.910" style="s2">the onus mundus and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.480" end="01:21:15.770" style="s2">reflected in your neurological structure</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.910" end="01:21:17.150" style="s2">and I think the fact that it&#39;s reflected</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.770" end="01:21:18.650" style="s2">in your neurological structure and in</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.150" end="01:21:22.820" style="s2">the neurological structure of animals</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.650" end="01:21:25.340" style="s2">with this you know almost Universal dual</p>

<p begin="01:21:25.340" end="01:21:29.890" style="s2">also by the way is it is something</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.380" end="01:21:32.180" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary even in neural networks</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.890" end="01:21:34.250" style="s2">which is where we got the idea for</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.180" end="01:21:36.230" style="s2">plasticity and stability by the way for</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.250" end="01:21:38.710" style="s2">in the big five aspects scale models and</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.230" end="01:21:42.739" style="s2">the higher order personality factors I</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.710" end="01:21:45.739" style="s2">think the fact that that bifurcation is</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.739" end="01:21:47.840" style="s2">reflected in neurology is a reflection</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.739" end="01:21:50.390" style="s2">of the fact that it&#39;s it exists in</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.840" end="01:21:53.300" style="s2">reality now of course how defining</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.390" end="01:21:55.280" style="s2">reality is no simple thing you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.300" end="01:21:57.260" style="s2">you can think about it as an objective</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.280" end="01:21:59.750" style="s2">materialist but you can also think of</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.260" end="01:22:01.969" style="s2">reality as the sum total of that which</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.750" end="01:22:03.969" style="s2">is experienced and those aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.969" end="01:22:06.790" style="s2">things they aren&#39;t the same fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.969" end="01:22:10.010" style="s2">presuppositions and I think that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.790" end="01:22:13.820" style="s2">predicated our society insofar as our</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.010" end="01:22:15.650" style="s2">society is functional on the proposition</p>

<p begin="01:22:47.240" end="01:22:54.500" style="s2">I think we act that out and look guys</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.970" end="01:22:56.780" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna call it a night a because</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.500" end="01:22:58.730" style="s2">obviously this has got to be getting</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.780" end="01:23:00.890" style="s2">somewhat annoying for you to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.730" end="01:23:05.060" style="s2">constantly interrupted by these idiot</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.890" end="01:23:07.580" style="s2">software crashes and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.060" end="01:23:10.040" style="s2">approaching 9 o&#39;clock so even with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.580" end="01:23:13.990" style="s2">delays that&#39;s a good hour and a half and</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.040" end="01:23:16.550" style="s2">so I think maybe we&#39;ll call it a day and</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.990" end="01:23:17.990" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get too many questions although</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.550" end="01:23:22.250" style="s2">some of them were very very complicated</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.990" end="01:23:24.470" style="s2">and I would like to thank you for tuning</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.250" end="01:23:27.890" style="s2">in and maybe I can remind you again</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.470" end="01:23:30.980" style="s2">about self authoring calm and understand</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.890" end="01:23:33.710" style="s2">myself calm and the discount coupon code</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.980" end="01:23:35.510" style="s2">September so if you guys want to try out</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.710" end="01:23:37.310" style="s2">those programs I think they&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.510" end="01:23:40.070" style="s2">helpful and I think that&#39;s how people</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.310" end="01:23:43.670" style="s2">experience them then you can do that and</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.070" end="01:23:45.910" style="s2">then I&#39;ll have another Q&amp;A probably I</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.670" end="01:23:49.760" style="s2">would say probably in mid-october</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.910" end="01:23:52.300" style="s2">because I&#39;m on the road now you can see</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.760" end="01:23:55.820" style="s2">that in Jordan B Peterson calm at events</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.300" end="01:23:59.650" style="s2">I&#39;m on the road now until mid-october</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.820" end="01:24:01.490" style="s2">and so I&#39;ll do another Q&amp;A then and</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.650" end="01:24:03.770" style="s2">hopefully have an update on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.490" end="01:24:08.390" style="s2">educational progress of the educational</p>
