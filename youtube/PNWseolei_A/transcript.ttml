<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:39.920" style="s2">are weekly sessions where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:41.600" style="s2">explore pretty out there</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.920" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">harrowing horrifying essentially</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.600" end="00:00:46.640" style="s2">threatening ideas um</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:48.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s through the wisdom of pat ryan</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.640" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">the most dangerous man on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.399" end="00:00:52.000" style="s2">the structure is always the same we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">about a 40 minute lecture where pat</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">takes us through</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">first principle reasoning of some out</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">there</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">end so it&#39;s very rewarding that you stay</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">with the chain of reasoning i want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">encourage everybody to do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">um there&#39;s also some secret drinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">games that go on at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">and in the part two we get to ask some</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">so i encourage everybody to even if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">don&#39;t follow everything to kind of make</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:19.280" style="s2">note of things that are unclear</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">uh especially make note of things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">you want to challenge pat on</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">and then if you have any interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">insights then we&#39;ll go into a q a round</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:28.240" style="s2">in part two</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">last week we talked about alchemy uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.240" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">this week actually i&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">we&#39;re on about but this</p>

<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:00.880" style="s2">um this one is going to be about</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.000" end="00:02:04.479" style="s2">neuromythologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">um uh neuromyths are</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.479" end="00:02:08.080" style="s2">things we tell ourselves when we try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:10.160" style="s2">define the brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.080" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">we try to say that oh the brain you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.160" end="00:02:12.560" style="s2">heard these myths you&#39;ve heard them they</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">go like uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.560" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">um you use 10 of your brain right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">a neural myth</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually true you actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">use all your brain um so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">collection of these neuro myths that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">every civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:26.800" style="s2">has and it ends up being used to justify</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">certain actions</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.800" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">and certain moralities and certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">assumptions about the world and society</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">ourselves so it&#39;s important when</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">dismantling a blue church</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">to attack the neuromythologies that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">utilize as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">so excuse me that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">be doing tonight</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">and i&#39;ll try to make it worth your time</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">thanks much and here we go</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">all right neuromythologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">so this is uh still exploring this meme</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">we&#39;re almost done uh probably one more</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">of this and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">we&#39;ll be out of this meme finally um</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">season one was</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">talking about the future season two is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">talking about now</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">and in this particular talk we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">going over these wonderful concepts</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s all related to neuromythology</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">so we gotta start at the beginning with</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">neuromythology</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna start with egypt so they uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">they practiced mummification as you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">and when they began the mummification</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">process they would start with pulling</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">the brain out of the nose</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:35.920" style="s2">and that would either pull the organ out</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">or stir it up and then pour it out</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.920" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">whichever</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">it varied in different regions of egypt</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">that process is called excelebration</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">and the reason why they started with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">brain first</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">um because they didn&#39;t understand what</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:52.239" style="s2">the brain was</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">and the literal translation of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.239" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">was skull awful</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know what awful is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">like it&#39;s like the refuse it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">garbage meat that you&#39;d buy at a store</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">or like literal</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">crap and trash around everywhere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">literally worthless meat</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">um so the egyptians thought the brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">was worthless meat</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">they had no idea they didn&#39;t care um</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the more i think about it i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">that&#39;s true of a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">but you know they can be fixed um in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">fact there&#39;s one case where</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">they went through a mummy and in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">process of uh of digging out the brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">the tool broke off and it just stayed in</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">there i don&#39;t know i mean they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">really care about this stuff at all they</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">just they didn&#39;t they just wanted the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">brain out of the head</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">um and then you know meanwhile they</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">would preserve other organs like intact</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">really really down in great detail the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">kidneys deliver</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">uh they they dose those in drugs to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">really get like embalmed them for as</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">long as possible but they didn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">did not want the brain in that skull at</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">so the neuromythology of egypt was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">brain doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">i guess you gotta start somewhere right</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:57.919" style="s2">so then we get the grease</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">where this guy comes along um acmeon</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.919" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">yeah acmeon so so acmeon was known</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:06.880" style="s2">for dissection of corpses and humans</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">um and you would threaten people that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.880" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">chop you up</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">if you die so he kind of won a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">arguments anyway he&#39;s the guy who came</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">along with the idea that the brain was</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">the seat of human intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:19.199" style="s2">he uh poked and prodded around different</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.199" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">war victims for example uh soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">coming back from wars or people uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">harmed by soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">and noticed that when they had head</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">damage um they were acting very</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">their their character had fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">changed their soul was different</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">and so he was making the correlation</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">that well maybe this skull awful isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">what we think it is maybe it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">specific to intelligence and our very</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:46.639" style="s2">natures itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">of course it took a lot of head trauma</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.639" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">to make that association</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">um but humans are slow and i guess we</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">like ourselves that way</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">so um he is celebrated in the blue</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">uh because right here in this red box</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">physician basically he said that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">physicians should draw conclusions from</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">empirical observations</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">instead of divine revelation so this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">more blue church uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">jabbing and seedling the idea that uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">you know we have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">we have to you know science above all</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">you know and that that&#39;s that&#39;s blue</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">church&#39;s morality because with science</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">it can actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:21.039" style="s2">justify their policies and everything</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">else and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.039" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">this is this is a hero the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">uh then we keep going we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">medieval era now aristotle obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">medieval era but he was a heavy</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">influence of the medieval era</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">his his training and a lot of his</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">almost everything he wrote was devoured</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">by most learned</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:44.479" style="s2">people of that time um so he came up</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">with the idea of common sense or census</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">communist uh which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">so he didn&#39;t agree that intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">came from the brain he thought it came</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">from the heart</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">right so he said it was like this heart</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">thing um and this is where the soul is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">and this is where all intelligence comes</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">and the reason of thinking that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">because you can remove a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">from the human body and you don&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">but if you remove the heart you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">you can even remove parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">and you won&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">so the heart seeing as this like very</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">fundamental organ they just made the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">assumption well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">that&#39;s where the soul is because if i</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">remove that you&#39;re dead it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">logic to come to the conclusion to so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">it&#39;s not that his reasoning was faulty</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:28.720" style="s2">um it&#39;s fairly sound really</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">um although he did say that the brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.720" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">was a cooling agent for that soul</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">which is interesting um he might have</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">been right</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll get to that so then galin comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:43.039" style="s2">and he says the brain is uh where all</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">these common senses are actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.039" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">co-mingling oh and by the way it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">entirely of sperm</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">that i wish i was making that up right</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">that that was a commonly held opinion</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">all the way through the middle ages for</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">multiple cultures like you may have seen</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">like in china you see like</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">sometimes you see these cartoons and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">couldn&#39;t find it because i couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">remember the name of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">i wish i did um but it&#39;s usually this</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">old man</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">his forehead&#39;s like really enlarged and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">gorge</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">and he&#39;s like you know he has like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">cane and he&#39;s like he&#39;s old and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">always smiling</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">well the westerners look at that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">think oh what a funny little guy but</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">everyone in china knows that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">pervert</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">his head is full of semen that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.639" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">so he&#39;s it&#39;s like so this is a this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">multicultural cot like</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">commonly held assumption for almost all</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">of history that the brain was full of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">sperm</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">and to really drive home my point uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">leonardo da vinci would draw anatomy</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">in which the dick was connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">spine because the spine was a tube to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">get the sperm out of the brain so it can</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">shoot out the dick</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">so this this was really well like</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">held this whole concept um and i may</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">have focused on the pp for too long so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">let&#39;s get back to this part</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">um so the common senses are co-mingling</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">that was gallon&#39;s contribution in</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">addition to thinking the brain was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">sperm tank</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">um so so we&#39;re we&#39;re slowly iterating</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">here you gotta give these guys credit</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">um and then descartes comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">the car</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">basically all of us um he comes</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">along and says</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">makes a humongous sleep the brain is in</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">fact not a sperm tank which is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">observant of him thank you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">and that the pineal gland is the seat of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">the soul</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">due to its subtle asymmetry now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:34.839" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">the idea that most of the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:42.959" style="s2">uh is well known and well understood</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">even by even in pre-modern times</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">um but the pineal gland is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">little bit off it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">tiny bit off right so because of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">asymmetry it was actually it&#39;s unique in</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">and using that reasoning descarte</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">basically said the pineal grand</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">pineal gland was the seed of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">and of course that that leads to uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">pineal gland</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">memes meeting with eye of raw memes</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">because boy they kind of look similar</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">and then which goes on to mate with</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">hollywood memes to create illuminati</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">memes</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">and all that uh you know it&#39;s all fun</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">and games until you realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">wait a second if you get pineal gland</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">tumors they actually accelerate puberty</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">in children</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">that&#39;s uncomfortable so one wonders why</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.360" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">they focus on the pineal gland so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">but anyway um this was considered the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">seat of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">and held for until i mean they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">penalectomies in the 1920s uh it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">until</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">they started um trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">melatonin production</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">where they would uh take an animal brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">an animal panel gland</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">blend it down and then you had melatonin</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">which you could then like they would</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">inject it into salamander and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">salamander would turn colors</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">that&#39;s how they figured that stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:07.760" style="s2">but this this is a hell this is still</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">deeply held by some more wild sex</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">of of different cults and things as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">you know it has a lot of sticky power</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">that particular neuro myth</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">um so we get to the modern era now we</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">can laugh at all that primitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">interpretation of the brain right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">we&#39;re modern yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">just kidding we&#39;re just as stupid as</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">they are in fact descartes thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">that the brain was kind of a hydraulic</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">pump uh freud compared it to a steam</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">engine</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">carl uh private thinks it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">holographic storage device and most</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:37.279" style="s2">people here think the brain is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.279" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">so the i we keep coming up with these</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">dumb neuro myths they&#39;re bad analogies</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">they&#39;re feeding bunk science it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">crap really</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">and this is by gary marcus who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">fantastic resource by the way he wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">book called</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.279" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">the mind the birth of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">i highly recommend it it&#39;s a fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">book if you&#39;re coming from a code or</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">background like me</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">um he was able to take some</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">concepts about information theory and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">apply it to the brain without</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">saying the brain was a computer which</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">was really masterfully done</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a fairly old book it&#39;s like 1990</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">something it&#39;s a good read i recommend</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.040" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">um but he correctly points out that here</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">here we are doing our best to describe</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">what is effectively the most complicated</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">machine we could think of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">and say that&#39;s just like the brain which</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">is all throughout history like the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">complicated thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">for its time was a steam engine and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:36.320" style="s2">car&#39;s time was a hydraulic pump</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s stored you know so that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.320" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it we&#39;re we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">like thinking the most complicated thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">in engineering is our brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">and we&#39;re always wrong about this but</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">these are neural myths these are things</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">we tell ourselves about the brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">um and why is this why am i focused on</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">this weirdness well</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">because according to this fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">study um where they took</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:58.880" style="s2">educators normal people and people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.880" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">exposed to actual neuroscience and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">asked them a bunch of neuromythologies</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">is this true is this not true well 68</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">of people believed in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">neuromythologies and people who were</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">actually neuroscience oriented 46</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">of them believed in the neuromythologies</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s a really ongoing issue</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">where we come up with this really bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">analog of the brain and then everybody</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:24.720" style="s2">uses it</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">and you can&#39;t even question the damn</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">thing because so many people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">interlocking believing it it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">like a holy war to a degree</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">like there are people running around</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:33.519" style="s2">thinking the brain is a quantum computer</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">and if i</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">call them out on that they&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:39.279" style="s2">you know yell at me throw fish at me or</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">something it&#39;s pretty bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.279" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">so here&#39;s here&#39;s an example of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">common neural myths that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">buy into</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.920" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">left brain versus right brain that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">very common mythology that people tend</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">to think like oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">left brain&#39;s organized right brain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">artistic and you know they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">fighting in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">no that&#39;s not true the brain is way more</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">uh we only use 10 of our brain that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:04.160" style="s2">mythology</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">that this is like oh well you should we</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">could be using 90</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">right no you are using 100 of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">you just don&#39;t have like conscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:12.880" style="s2">control over it and you&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">because if you did have conscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">control over your brain you probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">forget to breathe and fall over</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">so you don&#39;t want to have manual</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">override on your own nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">there&#39;s good reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">people have learning styles this is one</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">of those sticky myths don&#39;t approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">new mothers with this type of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">because they buy this stuff and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">will they will yell at you all</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">day long but there is no such thing as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2"> learning style</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">um you learn things unconsciously all</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">the damn time</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">like you will we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">demonstrably</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">done this to where people are we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">train someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:55.040" style="s2">on very subtle on very subtle signals to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">do something so for example</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.040" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">when i don&#39;t like a co-worker um</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">i&#39;m a very evil person um when i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">like uh when i don&#39;t like a co-worker</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">i will uh god what what did i do i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">i was like</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">i would do i would make a noise every</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">time a certain event happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">point that the co-worker started looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:16.399" style="s2">for the noise when</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">when that event happened but i was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.399" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">training his subconscious system</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">um so people learn even you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">learning isn&#39;t this like</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">i&#39;m going to sit there and hit the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">switch and now i&#39;m in learn mode no it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work that way you you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">uh brain development ends upon puberty</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">this is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">brain develops it&#39;s always going on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">always going on but this is a common</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">neural myth</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">48 of neuroscientists believe this</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">learning is from new brain cells being</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">formed</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:50.639" style="s2">no that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s how they connect it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.639" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">not new pathways yes not new brain cells</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">and you were born with a fixed mental</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">capacity again not true you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">define what mental capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">so these are these are common</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">mythologies and a lot of people buy this</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">and it would be silly in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">because it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">but unfortunately these myths</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">they become the justification for</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">policies</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">like really rushed policies and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">give you the most powerful and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">neural myth that we all believe in</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:27.120" style="s2">in some capacity or another and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:27.120" style="s2">the neural myth of equality</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.519" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">that is a neuromyth and why is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">under our myth i&#39;ll show you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">clearly these organs of my body are the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">byproduct of intelligence you ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">creationists</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">not the brain brain&#39;s magic brain can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">be the product of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">because if it is then you&#39;re racist</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">because there&#39;s differences in brains</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">now there&#39;s difference in how they</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.759" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">oh no now we can&#39;t use science for our</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.759" end="00:16:57.440" style="s2">precious science</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">and if we want to use science to protect</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.440" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">our precious science we&#39;ll just say</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">neuroplasticity</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">they&#39;ll say oh my brain will do anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll turn into a bar stool</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:06.880" style="s2">if i if i just you know change my</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">plasticity enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.880" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">so this is an example of a neuromyth</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">where the science is pretty strong over</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s intentionally denied over here</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">and pretty aggressively denied</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">now admittedly this wasn&#39;t done in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">vacuum why this is denied</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">so we should probably explore how this</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">got denied so hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">um it&#39;s because the neuro myths justify</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">behavior policies and reactions</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">so let&#39;s start with the wild ass neuro</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">myth of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">the three-fifths compromise that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">pretty wild neuro myth if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">ask me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">very dangerous and deadly one too the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">idea that black slaves are three-fifths</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">of a human</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">obviously not their brain part right</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the neuro myth</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">behind slavery and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">galton&#39;s dream of improving the human</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">genetic stock</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">where they want to get rid of the low iq</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">people and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">promote the high iq people again a neuro</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">myth that is justifying policy</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">and then a dolphin hortler is running</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">around he wants to improve the dolphin</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">genetic stock</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:08.640" style="s2">again we&#39;ve we&#39;ve seen what that how</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">that turns out that doesn&#39;t turn out so</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:13.039" style="s2">hot</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.919" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">what is his secret plan hmm but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">these are these are neuro myths the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">of of the uh the dolphin race having</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">like a better brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">so you know neuromus they justify really</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2"> up policies</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">so you got to be real careful what</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">numerous you actually believe in</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">because that you know on this side is</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">going to be challenges to this</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:36.240" style="s2">if the three-fist compromise is</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">rationality behind slavery then you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.240" end="00:18:38.720" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">this guy shows up comes up with a couple</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.720" end="00:18:41.440" style="s2">of dogs and starts training him to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">complicated actions</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.440" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">i mean if i can train dogs to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">differently obviously we can train</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">these so-called three-fifths humans you</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">know so what&#39;s the problem here</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s a successful challenge</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">of it right</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">and then when you&#39;re trying to improve</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">the human genetic stock you just end up</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:00.799" style="s2">in endless dysgenics</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">where people are just rebelling against</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">and then jeez now we have to use our</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">entire civilization to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">that one neuro myth never happens again</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">so you have to be real careful with what</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">neuromust you subscribe to because if</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t fall for the trick over</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">here you&#39;ll fall for the reaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">and when white women cry we all know we</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">gotta we gotta listen</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">right so we gotta we gotta get our we</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">gotta get our civilization we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">stop this neuro myth</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">by using even worse neural myths it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s so ass backwards</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">and then again how does this you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s keep exploring this</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">justification why</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">why we&#39;re not allowed to apply evolution</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">to the brain um</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">so the observations brains should be uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">treated differently because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">because they are differently my brain is</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">not your brain your brain&#39;s not my brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">all of our brains are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">different that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a no-brainer right so uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:57.280" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">my brains are the best and their brains</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.280" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">are whack that crazy dolphin right</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">uh and then uh the reaction is all</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">brains</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">uh should be all brains are equal and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">should be treated the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">that&#39;s how you react against the dolphin</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">so then uh people have dispositions and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:16.720" style="s2">preferences that&#39;s a fair observation</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.200" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">the dolphin runs comes and says no</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.720" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">there&#39;s only the dolphin way and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">the reaction becomes i can train any</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">human to be anything at any time</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:26.480" style="s2">then i care about and you know people</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">care about their tribes a fair</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:30.640" style="s2">i really care about my tribe at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:32.400" style="s2">expense of someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.640" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the dolphin that damn dolphins</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.400" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">violent man um and then the reaction is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">going to be we should care about peop</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">all people equally so so what are we</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">doing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">we&#39;re here we&#39;re in the reaction phase</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">against the neuromyth</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve pivoted our entire</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:47.919" style="s2">civilization to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">that this neuromuth isn&#39;t allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.919" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">happen and in the process we&#39;ve embraced</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">utter trash neuromyths absolute trash</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">oh by the way this guy&#39;s benefiting from</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">all of it because he gets cheap labor he</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">can fire artisanal labor whenever he</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">wants and everyone&#39;s equally worthless</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">so this is this is what happens you this</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">was a bad neuro myth</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">we can all mostly agree to that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2"> angry dolphin right this is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">a better neuro myth</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">this is not better just because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:21.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s still resulting in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">up things so you got to be careful with</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.440" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">your neural myths</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:28.840" style="s2">and we are yeah you are here it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">get better from here by the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.840" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">so what is what is this what what what</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">does the neuro myth manifest</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">what does it make real what behavior</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">does it justify</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">especially in a democratic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">where every person is worth the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">vote</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">no matter what your background is no</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">matter what your neurology is no matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">what your experiences are you are all</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">the same vote</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.520" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">and then you mix that up with equality</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">obsession the neural myth of equality</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">and then you mix it with psychographic</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">liberal capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">its clown world clown world all the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">obesity is the idea that i&#39;m exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">same as someone with</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">discipline because i&#39;m equal</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">my neurology is the same that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">matters right</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:16.080" style="s2">and then hysteria and guardian heart if</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">i&#39;m doing bad faith force making</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.080" end="00:22:20.159" style="s2">if i&#39;m screaming at you if i&#39;m yelling</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">at you in a threatening force that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.159" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">exactly the same as an intentional stoic</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">doing sense making</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">in a world of equality it is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">and the reason it&#39;s the same is because</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">of the neuromythology my brain is equal</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">to your brain</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t matter what my behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter what i do</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">because my brain is the same and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">callous altruism and what forest where</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">equality means</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">i only need to care about the outliers</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">and i don&#39;t need to care about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">median</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">and then catharsis denialism and state</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">and stasis</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">where it&#39;s a never-ending crusade of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:02.559" style="s2">redefining the median</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t get catharsis you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.559" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">actually beat the demons you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">inventing</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">because if you do then your crusade&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">over so we gotta redefine the damn thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">all over the time</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">so we deny ourselves catharsis so this</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">is this is the clown world this is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">the neuro myth</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">has made normalized this is what it made</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">real and we&#39;re all living in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">all the damn time no breaks no exit</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">no way out and it only gets worse from</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">and this is all because of the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">myths we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:35.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve dedicated a warning crusade</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">against one bad neuro myth</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.679" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">and we are now enabling even worse ones</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">as a result</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">so instead of trying to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">prescriptions about the brain</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">and say the brain is this thing and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">that thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">and trying to champion my personal</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">neural myth the most i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:59.039" style="s2">step back and say let&#39;s not do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">for the next 10 minutes right let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">why don&#39;t we start looking at not what</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">is or what the brain should be or how we</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">can use</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">the brain to justify morality how about</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">we just find the dependencies</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">of the brain how about we find</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">the limitations of it because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">lot of assumption in a lot of the neural</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">myths we believe in</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">that the brain is infinitely plastic it</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:25.279" style="s2">can do whatever it wants it can</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">it can be wired here and i i was a chef</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">yesterday and today i&#39;m a skydiver and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:30.080" style="s2">look how plastic my brain is right</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:31.760" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s the mythology we tell</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">ourselves secretly</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.760" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">and sometimes openly um but let&#39;s not do</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">that let&#39;s just find the dependencies</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">like let&#39;s find the structural</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">limitations of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">and figure out from there let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">instead so i&#39;ll walk you through it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">first thing we&#39;re going to focus on is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">neurons the limitations of neurons</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.960" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">forbidden phrase in the blue charge</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to say for</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">limitations of neurons because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.760" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">magical and they&#39;re always right</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">um so in this case uh most cells perform</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">mitosis</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">but not the neuron neuron does not</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">perform mitosis</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">and it has a fully functional nucleus by</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">the way completely functional</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">dna is there you know everything&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">its job just fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t go through mitosis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">an interesting limitation</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s indicative of something the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">reason we look for the limitations is so</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">that we understand the structural biases</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:25.840" style="s2">so that we can understand why the brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">even exists to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.840" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">because if we&#39;re going to put so much</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">focus on this damn thing and use it to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">justify this endless clown world</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">show that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s worth looking into</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">the cognitive the pressures behind</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">cognitive evolution</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to endlessly come up with</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">neural myths you know let&#39;s find the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">dependencies let&#39;s figure out how this</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">damn thing evolved</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">and this is a this is a a very good</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">piece of evidence about how the brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">evolved and why the brain evolved</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">most more importantly why so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">clue</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">this is a clue and then temperature</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">most people don&#39;t know about brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">temperature they think yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a brain right bro no it is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">you only have one celsius degree</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.360" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">bandwidth to work with</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">so the brains and the temperature that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">it&#39;s in and the largest distance between</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">any part of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:15.679" style="s2">if you measure all the temperatures of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">all parts of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.679" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">between the highest temperature and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">lowest temperature is one</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">celsius one</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:27.120" style="s2">that is a remarkably narrow zone</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">that you have to keep your temperature</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.120" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">in and to keep the brain there</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">that is a miraculous piece of work in</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">uh it&#39;s uh if you if you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">you know you start bringing your body</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">temperature up 70 percent of information</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">that&#39;s normally retained is lost</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">at 35. so if even if you go from</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:51.840" style="s2">if you start at 36.7 c and you drop</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">one degree 70 of information is now lost</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.840" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">you&#39;re not remembering it just</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">one degree that&#39;s wild right</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">that is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">crazy crazy narrow fine-tuned result</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">and then the brain is it&#39;s compromise of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">two percent of the body mass</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">takes 25 of your total glucose and 20</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">oxygen consumption</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">this is a metabolically demanding organ</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">with intense heat production</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">this is generating heat all the time</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">and even with all of this like firepower</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">and horsepower</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">it still has to maintain that tight band</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">of temperature</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">and then this one is yeah and different</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:39.120" style="s2">states of temperature management for</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">example when you are</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.120" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">deeply anesthetized your temperature</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">drops your body temperature drops when</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">an anesthetized the brain temperature</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">drops i mean um</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">and when you sleep uh it rises and falls</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">with sleep as well and arousal as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">so so this is uh this is another clue</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">why does the brain need this temperature</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the question you would ask</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:03.039" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to have this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">doing its best to have it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.039" end="00:28:06.480" style="s2">consuming a tremendous amount of your</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">biochemistry to make it happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s still able to dissipate</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">heat</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">like a heat sink like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">a finely tuned heat sink</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">and then we look at stimuli a quick</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">science lesson a photon is a byproduct</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.120" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">of one atom reducing its energetic state</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">so pew that means for every photon</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">there&#39;s one atom at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">and when we&#39;re talking about a light</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">bulb light bulb at around 100 watts is</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">generating 300 quintillion photons per</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">so that&#39;s uh 300 quintillion atoms</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">changing their energy state per second</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">in your eyeball both of your eyes are</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">only receiving 400 million of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">wait what wait hold on</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">if you do the math you&#39;re only seeing</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">this much of the light bulb</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">that&#39;s it not just the light bulb</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">of every single thing you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">you&#39;re only seeing that fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">reality of me</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">of your hand put your hand in front of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">your face you&#39;re only seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">percentage of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">where&#39;s the other where&#39;s all the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:19.520" style="s2">information what the what the where</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">where did i go turns out your brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:24.399" style="s2">can&#39;t handle the truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">because it&#39;s too much information</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.399" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a key piece of evidence it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">stimuli the brain is intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">reducing the amount of stimuli that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">it&#39;s going through a filter process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">saying it doesn&#39;t need everything it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:38.399" style="s2">just needs what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">what&#39;s important well we&#39;ll get there in</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">a moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">let&#39;s look at the topology of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">if you adjust the volume the weight the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">size of this brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">that means the neck muscles have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">change the bone structures have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">your endocrine system has to change</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">blood flow changes</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a structurally expensive</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">process to fundamentally change your</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.080" end="00:30:04.399" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">uh that&#39;s why evolution is so damn slow</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.399" end="00:30:08.799" style="s2">that&#39;s why evolution is so damn slow</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">it&#39;s because of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.799" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">because in order for the brain to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">any change it has to change the entire</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:16.240" style="s2">body first</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">so all of these things have to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">synchronized as they move they have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">move very slowly</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">because the the dependency chains are</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:27.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s three pounds of every reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever been wrong about anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">ever so you got three pounds</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">roughly and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.159" style="s2">uh the jerry and the and the sulky they</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.159" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">found in most animals most people think</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">that the brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">uh that that wrinkling is found in all</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">animals it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s found in elephants it&#39;s found in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">humans and is found on like 20 other</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:51.360" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t exist for most of the animal</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:54.240" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.360" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">and furthermore while this looks random</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.240" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">these little divots in these valleys and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">these foldings these foldings</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">they are consistent between individuals</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">meaning the foldings in your brain are</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">very consistent with mine</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">and this is across races too and genders</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">so these folds matter it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">throwing a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">neuroplastic men it can solve everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">huh no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:23.760" style="s2">a very specific structure going on here</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very very specific</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">so let&#39;s look at let&#39;s summarize these</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:29.519" style="s2">dependencies</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve analyzed them we&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.519" end="00:31:32.320" style="s2">okay here are some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">limitations about the brain that&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.320" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">clues to why the brain even evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to start by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">where have we seen these problems</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">so we have footholds to work with as we</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">explore these these</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:49.279" style="s2">clues so uh the folding packs more</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:50.159" style="s2">neurons in the same space that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">limitation</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.159" end="00:31:53.840" style="s2">because your skull is an actual physical</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">limitation you can&#39;t just get more skull</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.840" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">so you gotta pack you gotta really just</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">stuff that you know it&#39;s like stuffing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">shirt in a goddamn like potato chip bag</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">just you know just crumpling it all in</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">um where have we seen this activity</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">when it came to miniaturization and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">exception driven</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">chip fabrication you see the same exact</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">thing you&#39;re just packing and packing</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">reducing and getting it further down</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">you&#39;re stuffing more transistors on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">damn thing you&#39;re just just</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">going balls out as hard as you can using</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:26.480" style="s2">every hack</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">and every tiny fractal optimization you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">can find</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">to get more and more on there so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">a constant pressure</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">to get neurons as packed as possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a guaranteed given</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">the neurons that are existing within the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">within your body</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">they are there as a byproduct of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">chemical support your biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">support systems what it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">maximally capable of given the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:55.919" style="s2">uh the metabolic um</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">extreme consumption that the brain has</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.919" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">changes in the brain mean changes to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">anatomic and support systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">so like i said i gotta change so many</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">things if i change one part of my brain</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s why everything goes so slow</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">well we see the exact same problems when</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">we&#39;re engineering for effective escape</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:15.120" style="s2">velocity</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s the exact same issue where i</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.120" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">fuel to leave the planet but to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">more fuel i need more structure which</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">means i have more weight which means i</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:23.519" style="s2">need more fuel to move the more weight</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">which means i need more structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">because now</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">now i&#39;m just caught in this loop</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">of crazy um</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">and you have to you have to get real</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">specific about your your mass</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">your rocket fuel and your velocity</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">ratios so you can actually achieve</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">escape velocity it&#39;s a very fine-tuned</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">and the same is true about about</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:44.559" style="s2">increasing neurological</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">structures and changes temperatures have</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.559" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">to be within a one celsius zone</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s crazy right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">same thing we see in finely tuned</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">sensitive quantum computers</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">they need to operate at very very</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:34:01.039" style="s2">specific temperatures</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">oh raven here your mic&#39;s on um</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.039" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">the uh so this is these are problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen in other computation devices</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">and you have to solve for that and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">have massive gamers have</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">massive heat sinks on their on their</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">cpus right</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">neurons can&#39;t go through mitosis uh same</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">thing with</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">maximum transistor counts you can only</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">pack so many transistors on to</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">the uh wafer in fact we get we get to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">the point where</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">we actually can&#39;t make transistors any</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">smaller so you might have noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">um cpus have been pegged at three</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">gigahertz for like the past 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">despite all the advances that are going</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">on breaking that three to four gigahertz</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">range</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">well that&#39;s because of quantum physics</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">you actually can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">less than like six trans like six atoms</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:49.119" style="s2">for a transistor</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">because once you go below six atoms and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:51.839" style="s2">quantum fluctuations just break the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">whole thing apart</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.839" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">so you don&#39;t get a reliable band of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:59.440" style="s2">electricity going through it</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">so we found the the most</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.440" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">optimal atomic configuration for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">transistor and now we&#39;ve pegged our</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">counts</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">well the neurons have done the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">thing they cannot go through mitosis</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">which means</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.680" style="s2">the number of neurons that you have are</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">optimized it&#39;s not like they can go</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.680" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">through mitosis and get</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">more on demand you you get what you work</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">with you you get what you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">the brain is not selecting for sensing</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:26.079" style="s2">atomic reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">remember the photons we can only see so</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.079" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">many of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:31.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not seeing atomic reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">seeing a holograph</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.200" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">of reality reality is the holograph</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">right so we see this in compression uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">decompression and psychophysics</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">like the mp3 for example the way the mp3</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">works why it&#39;s so small</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">typically an mp3 a recorded sound wave</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">should be like</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know 60 to 80 megabytes but an</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">mp3 gets it down to three</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:54.240" style="s2">and the way it does it is called</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">psychophysics so</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.240" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">there&#39;s only certain frequencies that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:35:59.119" style="s2">actually hear with a high level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">clarity and everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.119" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">outside of that range is garbage anyway</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">so we don&#39;t need to pack all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">information at the high and the low</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:07.200" style="s2">frequencies</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">so you just strip those entirely and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">then you just focus on primarily the 2k</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">to 5k</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">range of frequency and then you compress</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge part of the mp3 being so</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">tiny as it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the actual song but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">sounds like the actual song it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">like the actual recording your brain</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s an example of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">psychophysic algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">and it turns out uh for the visual</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">cortex it&#39;s doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s only picking upon reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">that&#39;s important that you can care about</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:42.320" style="s2">and everything else is just garbage that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">the brain doesn&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.320" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">and then brains are uh metabolically</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:49.119" style="s2">greedy and they can imbalance glucose</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">and oxygen economies uh we&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.119" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">contract enforcement financial</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">forecasting game theory</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">you know if you screw my access to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">resources i screw your access to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">resources type thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">so these are the clues</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">of the limitations of the brain so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">can actually like</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">be responsible with our neuro myths</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">being reckless like we have been excuse</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">um and here&#39;s some examples of where</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen these limitations just to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">have an analog to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">get the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">so we&#39;re trying to understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">build a responsible neuro myth</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">so it probably helps to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:34.400" style="s2">the brain may be doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to start with some some</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">premises here we&#39;re going to say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">inside this bubble this is the permanent</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">noise factory that is the universe</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">the universe is just full of information</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:47.280" style="s2">and matter and matter</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">and energy and it&#39;s all noise it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:51.280" style="s2">non-stop noise so it shoots out</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">a photon</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.280" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">from this noise little photon comes out</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">hits the physical interface of the body</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">which intercepts the energy and either</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:03.839" style="s2">moves and either the body moves towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">the energy or away from the energy at</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.839" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">the very minimum</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">then it goes starts the neural cascade</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">which then fires roughly at 180 miles</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">per hour</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">up your arms or through your nervous</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:17.680" style="s2">system um and that&#39;s converted into</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:18.720" style="s2">that energy is converted into a neural</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">a neuron equivalent known as stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like the photon is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">running through your body it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">impact of the photon on the nerve</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">that that&#39;s going up your body if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">if it&#39;s heating i should say if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:30.480" style="s2">heat in particular you&#39;ll feel that but</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.480" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">an optic nerve sorry optics where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">you know it&#39;s actually hitting the cones</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:38.000" style="s2">and the rods</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not the photon literally going in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.000" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">my brain it&#39;s it&#39;s the excitation of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">but that excitation is a representation</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">of the photon and that&#39;s the important</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">takeaway there</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">so then it goes into the brain which i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">starting to think uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">as in terms of a symbol economy so</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">i am a collection of atoms</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">uh and you see my hologram</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.000" end="00:39:09.359" style="s2">based on this understanding of energy</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">exchanges and how the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.359" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">perceiving reality</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">and in that hologram it&#39;s going into</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:16.720" style="s2">your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:18.160" style="s2">into your brain and you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:20.640" style="s2">symbols about me</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">now why are symbols important symbols</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">are important because if you had to</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">constantly update</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:27.359" style="s2">if you had to constantly see reality at</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">all times in order to make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.359" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">if i just did this</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t have a symbol of me you</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">had no symbol processing</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">you would be asking yourself where is</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">that voice coming from well you already</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">have a symbol of me in your head</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">so there you have the representation of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">me i don&#39;t need to be here at all times</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">so we&#39;re actually we&#39;re creating this</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:48.079" style="s2">like constantly</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">incorrect and out of date map of reality</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">in our brains at all times</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s always it&#39;s always out of date</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">but the brain still works with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">information because it&#39;s better than</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:58.640" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not permanently in sync at</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.640" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">all times that&#39;s okay we can we can get</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">we can make it work</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:09.839" style="s2">and then sorry</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:10.880" style="s2">then the energy economy those symbols</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.839" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">they require</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.880" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">biochemical consumption of glucose and</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">oxygen to form</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">so in your body there is also a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">signature being generated for every</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:23.440" style="s2">symbol you are processing and handling</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">and dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">and that is that is a unique signature</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">too and if you want to check out um</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">uh carl fristen that&#39;s that&#39;s carl</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">fristan&#39;s stuff right there</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">he&#39;s talking all about the free energy</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">principle and whatnot regarding bayesian</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">brains</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">but there is a there is a biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">signature of every symbol</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">in your body every symbol that get gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">made in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">and then the thermal economy remember we</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.280" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">have that one band of seed we got to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">work with</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">that&#39;s super tight and you got to stick</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">to that band</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">so now the biochemical consumption has</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:55.040" style="s2">to be converted into the thermal</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">equivalent too</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.040" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">so when you get a symbol in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a biochemical consumption and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">then there is a thermal consequence</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:04.160" style="s2">and the and the interaction between</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">these three things is like a triangle</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.160" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">it&#39;s unstable so i should say it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">most it&#39;s the most minimum stability you</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">is a triangle in order for something to</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">to stay self-regulating</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">so this is how you are generating the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">universe in your brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">roughly and at a mid level not not not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">high level but a mid-level right</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">so we start with that objective reality</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">and as we get further and further along</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">in this process</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">more and more of objective reality fades</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">away and as we go more and more on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:39.119" style="s2">process symbolic reality takes over</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">the hologram the symbolic reality is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">only reality</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:43.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever had and it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.440" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">you&#39;ll ever have and that&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">that we&#39;re dumb and we need to fix this</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">it&#39;s the fact that we this isn&#39;t even a</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">problem this is the result</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">of all of the efficiencies and all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">the equilibrium and all the balance that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">our brain has evolved to handle</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t want objective reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">going to kill it</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">it will literally kill the brain trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">to understand objective reality you will</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">run yourself out of glucose and oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:13.680" style="s2">uh pretty quickly if you started seeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.680" style="s2">every atom this is bad news</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:18.319" style="s2">and so from here we get our reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:18.319" style="s2">filter</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">so the balance between the symbols the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">energy and the thermal</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">creates what it is we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:29.200" style="s2">looking for from this permanent noise</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re a bee and we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:31.920" style="s2">flowers maybe we&#39;re a crab and we need</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.920" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">we&#39;re a hermit crab and we need a shell</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re elephants and it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">bang</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">maybe we want to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">maybe this wolf is chewing on this lamb</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:42.079" style="s2">and they&#39;re all cute i don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">i got that picture but the simple</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.079" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">economies in our head they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">stabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">with the energy economics within our</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:51.760" style="s2">body as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">so the reality you&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.760" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">everything you&#39;re seeing and everything</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">you can conceive of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">is the signature of economic</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">efficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">that&#39;s a wild way that&#39;s a hard thing to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">grok the idea that reality</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">looks the way it looks is because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">the most efficient</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">balance between energy thermals and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">and meat space that&#39;s a very very weird</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">thing to think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">but according to this i might be right</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:28.480" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s run with this a</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">little bit further if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.480" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">craft the neuromyth</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">out of this um the neuron can be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">dna bypassing its own structural</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:41.119" style="s2">limitations</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">now how can that be we&#39;ll take our</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.119" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll take our model we were exploring</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">look at our our reality filter i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:48.000" style="s2">some instead of a you know this whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">thing it&#39;s just going to represent it as</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.000" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.800" end="00:43:55.599" style="s2">so here we are my reality filter it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.760" end="00:43:57.599" style="s2">time for me to interact with reality</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.599" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">i&#39;m going to say ah from this permanent</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.599" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">noise factory i need</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:04.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i need a birthday cake okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">so i need a birthday cake whatever i</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.800" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">just need one</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">so my filter reality i&#39;m going to write</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">into reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">this very long beautifully exquisitely</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">manicured</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">explanation on why i need a birthday</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">cake right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">very long post but it&#39;s cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:22.480" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">to write all this stuff and build it all</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.480" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">up i had to burn a lot of biochem</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">i had to generate some heat i had to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">have that heat piped away</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">i had to go recalling through my memory</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">and i had to go through my symbols and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">keep my social relations on track</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">this is a cognitively expensive</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">operation</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">and when i throw it into this void</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">nothing comes out</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">not a damn thing comes out so i spent</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">all those resources</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">and i got nothing and i still need a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">birthday cake</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">okay let&#39;s change my messaging</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">this is cognitively cheap oh look</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">six brains popped out the void well holy</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:04.800" style="s2">there is a economic game going on</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">in our communication that is driven</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.800" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">entirely by this</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">and this this is cognitively cheap</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">i just said one word and now i got six</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">brains i had the attention of six brains</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">i got you i got you all and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">expensive for me</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">now somebody get me this cake</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">that was it so now i&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">command from the void</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">the thing that i needed so evolution</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:33.280" style="s2">cannot optimize neurons any further</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">due to these economic limitations</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.280" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">it is selected for neurons to summon</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">so so the idea of making a cyber brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">is a joke it&#39;s pointless the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">we can just change evolution and we get</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">a better brain that&#39;s that&#39;s a joke too</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">because we see the economic costs</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">associated with all that all the complex</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">bean counting and balancing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">associated with it you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:04.319" style="s2">so the neuron has bypassed dna dna goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">through the evolutionary process in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.319" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">random haphazard manner</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">the neuron says nah no no no screw that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">we got our own way thanks and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">going to do is we&#39;re going to summon</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">other neurons for our moment for</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">hey come here do this thing okay great</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re actually optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">communication and socialization and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">getting to know one another</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">so with that said we can now make a shot</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.839" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">at a neural myth proposal</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">i&#39;m going to call it cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">thermodynamics so here&#39;s how it works</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">you have input it&#39;s energy mass that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">the input</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">and they have the output which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:48.160" style="s2">emotional behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">as neural summoning as neuron summoning</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.160" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">if i&#39;m if i&#39;m yelling at someone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">not because i&#39;m emotional as if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">if i&#39;m happy and i&#39;m laughing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">not because i&#39;m emotional</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">my emotions are serving a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">they&#39;re serving a function</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">they actually do something and what they</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">is that is the shortcut the brain has</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">figured out</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">to summon more neurons so hey i have</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:12.640" style="s2">this emotion you see the emotion</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">you&#39;re either attracted or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.640" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">repulsed by it if you&#39;re attracted great</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">now we can share neurons</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">now we can actually share cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">space we can tell stories we can do all</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:22.720" style="s2">these things and we can work together i</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">can offload my cognitive demand onto you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">and now we&#39;re working in parallel that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">is a very much</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">easier solution than trying to grow my</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">brain bigger</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s a lot less dangerous too unless</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">i&#39;m an asshole and then you punch me and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">then maybe the neuron summoning needs to</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">take a chill for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">but what about all the stuff that input</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">so this this implies an input and an</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">output</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">what about all the stuff i&#39;m taking in</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t become behavior</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">where does that go well that&#39;s heat</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">it&#39;s ideas thoughts symbols</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.640" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">so all of our ideas are heat</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">the brain evolved like a heatsink</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the parallel so why this neuro</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">myth is useful</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">is because it actually destroys all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:12.319" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">neural myths it completely eliminates</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.319" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">now how can it do that well for starters</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">uh the behaviors trash can go kick rocks</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">uh they&#39;re running around saying inputs</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">everything and i if i control the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">environment i control the brain</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">and they have some pretty compelling</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">science behind that yes it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t like you as a human so</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2"> off</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">and then we have uh then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">incomplete moral doctrines determining</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">what your behavior should be you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:38.559" style="s2">your behavior should be this and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">should do that you should this</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.559" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">well they can go kick rocks too because</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">now my emotional behavior has a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason behind it and so if i</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">start looking at my neural myth like</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:50.880" style="s2">instead of saying i have to subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">or defeat some moral doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.880" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">no i know what emotions are doing now i</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">know what their function is i know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">okay it&#39;s just neuron summoning simple</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">and then bye bye hyper individualism so</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">instead of your ideas and your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">being a representation of you as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.000" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">person and your personality being so</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">bound up and the holographs you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">consuming get the out of here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">just heat</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">so what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">all the neural myths</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">by embracing this one so your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">no longer your identity</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">you&#39;re not in descartes prison any</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">longer you are free</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">and it was a cooling agent after all he</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">was right</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">that&#39;s it thanks folks</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">well thanks again pat for another</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">the brain bending session um</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">i think like a background message and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">that i want to clarify is that all</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">are you suggesting that all explanations</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:11.920" style="s2">because they&#39;re fundamentally like in</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">that symbolic realm not objective realm</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.920" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:18.800" style="s2">destined to be normates like we&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:18.800" style="s2">actually touch what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">you&#39;re on you thanks the neuro myth is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.119" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">the series of collections we try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">attach</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">to the brain in the hopes to understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">it um</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">regarding the simulation uh that we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">the holograms and the symbols</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">of the of reality i mean i ran through</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">the numbers and you&#39;re not seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">whole light bulb right so what are you</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">um well what you&#39;re seeing for is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">what you&#39;re extracting from reality are</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">things that comport</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:51.920" style="s2">to your neural summoning strategies</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">so it could be mating it could be</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.920" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">finding friends it could be working</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">with people whatever so your your neuron</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">summoning strategies because the neuron</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">has hijacked</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:02.319" style="s2">dna at this point it says no we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna change this up</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.319" end="00:51:05.599" style="s2">um it hijacked it in the sense that um</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.599" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">started driving the show a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">economic equilibrium internally all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">biochemistry so</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:17.760" style="s2">um in the process of doing so the neural</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">summoning behavior you&#39;re engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.760" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been all engaging in for at</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">least the last million years</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">has been very much towards tribal</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">attitudes uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">dumbar number tribes and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:33.119" style="s2">um in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">that being a hologram yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.119" end="00:51:35.760" style="s2">hologram but it&#39;s also the only damn</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">thing you&#39;ll ever know</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.760" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay i mean not out here</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">rationalize camus or come up with stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:45.599" style="s2">like that but</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">um but ultimately the the general</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.599" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">is that yes it&#39;s a hologram yes it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:51.680" style="s2">you&#39;re going to know it&#39;s okay that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">all you&#39;re going to know</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">and trying to think that you can find</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:57.200" style="s2">more you might you can you know there</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.520" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">are techniques we have to explore that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">objective space to see what&#39;s repeatable</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">according to scientific method and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">we have alchemy which you can use to</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:05.280" style="s2">figure out the black boxes</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">we have a whole ecosystem of tools that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.280" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">are now at our disposal to use and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.720" end="00:52:10.559" style="s2">should be using all of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">so we shouldn&#39;t be relying on these eco</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.559" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">these um these neural myths</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:15.920" style="s2">to uh to do the driving for us anymore</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s almost no point</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.920" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">i i guess that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying um just</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">a reminder to everyone in the room</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">um just if you have any questions drop</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">them in the chat and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">call on you to ask them i&#39;m gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">going with some of my own</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">in the meantime um</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">i guess uh one of the things i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">about is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">if you have a definition of fitness here</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">i know you didn&#39;t really use that word</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">but that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">was what i was thinking about um like is</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">it darwinian fitness is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.800" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">fitness of you know ideas that are able</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">to replicate</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:53.440" style="s2">uh because of the wide diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">neurology that exists on this planet and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:57.520" style="s2">i&#39;m almost i almost said the n-word with</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">neanderthal but i didn&#39;t so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.520" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">drink</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">given the wide variety of you got to</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">take a half sip i didn&#39;t finish that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:06.160" style="s2">sentence</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">um uh the uh the wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">of neurology that exists what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">indicative of</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:16.400" style="s2">is it&#39;s showing all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:19.119" style="s2">thermal survival strategies it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.400" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">kinds of different heat sinks doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:22.400" style="s2">what it is that they&#39;re that their</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">behavior and their</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.400" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">bio organic um i&#39;m sorry their</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:32.400" style="s2">consumption is com is is making possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that fitness fitness might</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.400" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">not have ever</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:38.160" style="s2">been a thing um it&#39;s just the if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">look at the entire species performing an</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.160" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">instead of just inter interpersonal um</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:46.480" style="s2">uh interaction between competition</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">either for mating or for food or for</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">territory</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.280" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2">even that um is part of the thermal</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">equilibrium that the brain is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">do remember</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">all the simple processing is cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:57.599" style="s2">expensive it&#39;s it&#39;s energetically</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:53:59.839" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.599" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">so i need to do neuron summoning to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:02.720" style="s2">maximize my input so i can keep my brain</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">running</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">so the brain is like this it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:08.559" style="s2">bicycle it has to keep moving</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">and if you stop pedaling it all slows</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:13.119" style="s2">down falls over i need those resources</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">to keep my brain going and i need to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.119" end="00:54:15.920" style="s2">out there and cooperate and hunt</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">and compete and all those types of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:21.920" style="s2">things so fitness</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">fitness might be too too granular</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.920" end="00:54:25.760" style="s2">i&#39;m talking there&#39;s something even above</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">that and that&#39;s and that&#39;s this this</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.760" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">thermal pressure</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">this uh this energy thermal pressure</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">come not competition but this</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:34.240" style="s2">this balancing between symbols and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">thermal and energy consumption</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:39.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s driving the whole show so</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">with that i know that</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">you know the the grand devil entropy is</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">somewhere around the corner here</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">right all that out for us yeah so um</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">entropy here</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">is like uh i mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:53.760" style="s2">this is all you know the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:59.040" style="s2">driven by entropy to a degree</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.760" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">um but this is kind of a way to where</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.040" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">um how can i put this it&#39;s not that a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">fitness is happening it&#39;s not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:07.200" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">glorious fight against entropy think of</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.200" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">it more like</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">if entropy is always there reducing</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:15.200" style="s2">everything down</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">to the minimum that&#39;s all it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.200" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">not increasing disorder</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly reducing down to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:21.680" style="s2">indivisibles is trying to take any</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">complicated system and say</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">shake you down what&#39;s left you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">what&#39;s left okay just these atoms that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.040" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">what&#39;s left okay let&#39;s rebuild from</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">there right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">so if you go through that process with</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">that entropic driver</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">and so much energy and so much matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:38.640" style="s2">going on in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">what you end up with is infinite</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.640" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">possible combinations of what can</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">endure infinite possible combinations of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">what is able to resist against this</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.599" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">entropic shaking down to irreducibles</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">and so the neuron appears to be one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:57.599" style="s2">the better strategies</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">in terms of achieving that so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">it is absolutely a child of entropy for</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">just like dna is all right we got a few</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">questions coming in</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">in the chat uh last one for me is</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:10.720" style="s2">related to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">ai and i think you kind of made a</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.720" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">comment about this about how</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:15.920" style="s2">creating like cyber brains is a waste of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:17.200" style="s2">time i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s has anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.920" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">to do with ai</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.200" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">um but i would what i got from that</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">and correct me if i&#39;m wrong are you</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">suggesting that there is</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">nothing more efficient than</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">what evolution has produced and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">like follow-up to that is what if what</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">if evolution just</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">reached some sort of local maximum and</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a global maximum</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:40.799" style="s2">somewhere else that we could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.280" end="00:56:42.480" style="s2">reach</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.799" end="00:56:44.160" style="s2">the key here is to make sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.480" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">defining your your</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.160" end="00:56:47.359" style="s2">parameters for optimization and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:50.960" style="s2">efficiency here</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">so can we get better efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.960" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">um in the brain by changing its</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">configuration</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:59.119" style="s2">structure no and i&#39;m gonna that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">shocking answer to most people i know</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.119" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">and the reason i&#39;m saying no</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">is because any attempt to improve</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">efficiency of the brain is not actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:11.440" style="s2">improving the efficiency of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re selecting</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.440" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">for certain combinations of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">that are more beneficial than other ones</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:20.480" style="s2">so you&#39;re not actually improving</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:22.559" style="s2">efficiency here</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.480" end="00:57:24.559" style="s2">if i decide to say well let&#39;s remove</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.559" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">this part of the brain that controls</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.559" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know belief in god for example</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole army of people who would</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:32.160" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s pretty efficient in fact</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">there&#39;s 68</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.160" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">i actually know the number 68 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">people would say that&#39;s efficient</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s a neuro myth right</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">so um the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:44.880" style="s2">removing that who does it create</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">efficiency for is it creating efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.880" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">for the person</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">well that person doesn&#39;t have a belief</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">system anymore so</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:51.760" style="s2">what&#39;s the penalty what&#39;s the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">thermal penalty what&#39;s the energy</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.760" end="00:57:54.160" style="s2">penalty</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">how is that person engaging in neuron</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.160" end="00:57:58.720" style="s2">summoning what what types of</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">we aren&#39;t talking efficiency anymore</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.720" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">is a circular uh zero-sum game really</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">where you have i eliminate that part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">the brain now i fit better</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">in this system i mean we&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">all the time with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:14.799" style="s2">pharmaceutical psychopharmaceuticals i</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">mean that&#39;s technically doing what</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.799" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">you&#39;re asking where it&#39;s shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">parts of the brain or enhancing it or</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">making certain emotions not appear</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">is that efficiency that doesn&#39;t strike</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">me as efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:30.240" style="s2">so you know we&#39;ve seen what what neuro</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:31.839" style="s2">tinkering does uh getting finer control</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.240" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">over it and not having to bombard the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.839" end="00:58:34.720" style="s2">brain with like a pack of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:36.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know what all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.720" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">kids are doing these days heroin you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:39.760" style="s2">know just like</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">dousing the brain and these type of</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:43.839" style="s2">drugs um</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:44.880" style="s2">sure that might be a bit carpet bombing</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.839" end="00:58:46.480" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.880" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t think snipers are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">get you any better because you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">shutting down parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:54.559" style="s2">that evolve for a very specific reason</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:56.400" style="s2">so if you&#39;re talking efficiency you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">first have to define your economic order</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.400" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re selecting</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">for really well clearly</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">you haven&#39;t tried modafinil pad i have</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:07.520" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">all right um i&#39;m going to hand the next</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.520" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">question over to hannah</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.720" end="00:59:11.440" style="s2">and she has a question about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">collective consciousness hannah do you</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.440" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">want to meet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">yeah uh and i can try to give a</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:20.240" style="s2">definition of that if needed</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:21.440" style="s2">but i&#39;m kind of wondering where it fits</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.240" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.440" end="00:59:26.559" style="s2">is it more on the neuro mythology side</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.839" end="00:59:28.960" style="s2">or is it more on the neuron summoning</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.559" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">like is it a methodology of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">the concept of collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:35.599" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.079" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good point it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.599" end="00:59:37.839" style="s2">little bit of both as well there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:40.720" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.839" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">plenty of neuromythology around coming</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.720" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">together in collective intelligence in</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:45.599" style="s2">the internet and this type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">there&#39;s almost endless amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.599" end="00:59:49.599" style="s2">neuromythology around that concept</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">is there truth to it yes there is truth</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.599" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">to it the idea of when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">when you do the neuron summoning you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">the brains together and the brains do</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="00:59:58.720" style="s2">that&#39;s real that&#39;s what we&#39;ve selected</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.280" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">for um</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.720" end="01:00:03.520" style="s2">so yeah we do have a collective uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:05.359" style="s2">intelligence making sense making process</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.520" end="01:00:06.480" style="s2">it&#39;s very tribal it&#39;s very early and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.359" end="01:00:09.599" style="s2">use it all the time</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">uh we actually our entire concept of</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.599" end="01:00:12.160" style="s2">aesthetics and beauty actually comes</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">from that as well</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.160" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2">so the uh uh that does absolutely exist</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.839" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:20.480" style="s2">it go beyond dunbar&#39;s number well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">it can if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.480" end="01:00:23.839" style="s2">reduce the amount of information that</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">you need to track about a person</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.839" end="01:00:27.200" style="s2">so for example if i&#39;m if i&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:29.440" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.200" end="01:00:31.599" style="s2">i can know 300 people in dunbar&#39;s number</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.440" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">but i only but i can know like 20</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.599" end="01:00:35.839" style="s2">000 unique words for example um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:37.599" style="s2">quite the mismatch right that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.839" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">mismatch that&#39;s because words are</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">neurologically cheap and faces are</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">neurologically expensive</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.359" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">dunbar&#39;s number isn&#39;t just like a</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">constant in a script where you say 300</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:50.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">that that number is a peak</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.079" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">is a is an emergent peak in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">equilibrium system between symbols</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">energy consumption</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">and thermals so that number is that way</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:03.839" style="s2">because of how you process symbols</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s another one of those clues</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.839" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">about how the brain is working and why</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:09.599" style="s2">it evolved as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.400" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">so if i&#39;m tracking 300 faces</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.599" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">and i know them all in detail and i know</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:14.400" style="s2">the personalities and i know their</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:15.760" style="s2">relationships that that is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">collective intelligence sense making</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.760" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">if i reduce the amount of information</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">about a person</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.720" end="01:01:24.240" style="s2">if i say well that&#39;s bob and that&#39;s joe</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.240" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">sally and say okay i got those people</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">but if i wanted to reduce their</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:31.200" style="s2">information i would say oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">they&#39;re all democrats so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.200" end="01:01:34.000" style="s2">doing is you&#39;re creating a symbol for</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:35.920" style="s2">all three of those people but the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.000" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">problem of making simplified symbols is</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.920" end="01:01:40.960" style="s2">that that falls prey to the tribalism</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">as well you say oh this symbol&#39;s bad and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.960" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">everybody associated with that symbol is</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:46.240" style="s2">and so this is this is what constantly</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:48.400" style="s2">breaks</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.240" end="01:01:50.799" style="s2">the collective intelligence sense making</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.400" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">process uh because we use symbols to</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.799" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">shortcut this whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">to keep track of it all but they also</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:02:00.640" style="s2">fall prey to tribal</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:02:02.799" style="s2">um tribal behavior as well so um</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">people try they i mean we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.799" end="01:02:06.480" style="s2">trying our best</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:07.920" style="s2">to maximize uh neural summoning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.480" end="01:02:09.760" style="s2">what empire is that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.920" end="01:02:11.039" style="s2">civilizations are their attempts at</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.760" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">maximizing</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.039" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">um neural summoning basically but uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:17.839" style="s2">if you mismanage it and it gets really</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">easy to mismanage well</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.839" end="01:02:21.280" style="s2">your ability to summon neurons go</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:25.440" style="s2">bye-bye with it so</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.280" end="01:02:25.440" style="s2">empires rise empires fall as they say</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:30.079" style="s2">if i may i want to have a follow-up to</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.720" end="01:02:31.280" style="s2">hannah&#39;s question so the way i</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.079" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.280" end="01:02:36.079" style="s2">collective consciousness was more so</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">the subjective experience that people</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.079" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">sometimes report of</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.160" end="01:02:41.440" style="s2">on psychedelics or after meditation of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">being all</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.440" end="01:02:44.160" style="s2">one being and realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:46.240" style="s2">consciousness is some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.160" end="01:02:46.839" style="s2">distributed thing that expands beyond</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.240" end="01:02:49.359" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.839" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">selfhood and i&#39;m wondering if you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.359" end="01:02:55.039" style="s2">any thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:58.079" style="s2">there there is some pretty strong um</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.039" end="01:03:00.799" style="s2">there&#39;s some very strong evidence in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.079" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">fmri space that shows when one is</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.799" end="01:03:06.640" style="s2">intentional about their thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">you are focusing on different domains of</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.640" end="01:03:09.839" style="s2">data and you&#39;re focusing on different</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:11.359" style="s2">domains of stimuli</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.839" end="01:03:13.200" style="s2">so for example if i wanted to if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.359" end="01:03:14.400" style="s2">like if you if everyone sat here for a</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.200" end="01:03:16.240" style="s2">second just like</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.400" end="01:03:18.000" style="s2">breathed and then just said i&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.240" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">going to focus on my heartbeat</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.000" end="01:03:20.880" style="s2">you can actually slow down your own</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:22.079" style="s2">heartbeat for example right now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.880" end="01:03:23.200" style="s2">not you&#39;re not doing this consciously</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.079" end="01:03:23.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you&#39;re pitting us it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.200" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.599" end="01:03:26.880" style="s2">i grab heart and you know i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:30.079" style="s2">controlling a very</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">complicated biomechanical orchestration</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.079" end="01:03:33.520" style="s2">in my own body and i couldn&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">how the i&#39;m doing it</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.520" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t tell you like this is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:38.160" style="s2">machine i press and i use these fingers</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t i couldn&#39;t even tell you</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.160" end="01:03:43.280" style="s2">how i do it but i can do it</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:44.160" style="s2">so when you&#39;re wherever your focus is</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.280" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">and your attention</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.160" end="01:03:48.720" style="s2">is you&#39;re going to extract all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:49.520" style="s2">information from it as if it was a human</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.720" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">face</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.520" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">so here&#39;s what i mean by that the human</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:54.559" style="s2">face has a pile of information</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:55.920" style="s2">associated with it</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.559" end="01:03:57.520" style="s2">which means that&#39;s what we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">consuming so if i put my attention</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.520" end="01:04:00.319" style="s2">anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:01.280" style="s2">else all the information i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.319" end="01:04:02.880" style="s2">from that focus</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.280" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">is equivalent to the information i would</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.880" end="01:04:06.400" style="s2">get from a human face</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:08.319" style="s2">so if i&#39;m focusing on my heart i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.400" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">focusing on all the complicated</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">around it too</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:12.400" style="s2">i&#39;m watching for all the like the tiny</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:14.319" style="s2">little did the smile</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.400" end="01:04:16.079" style="s2">turn a certain way is his head turned a</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.319" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">certain way all that subtle nuance we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.079" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">constantly processing</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.359" end="01:04:21.760" style="s2">well now i&#39;ve steered it into my heart</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.599" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve steered it into my programming i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.760" end="01:04:25.359" style="s2">steered it into my work</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.039" end="01:04:26.799" style="s2">or i&#39;ve steered it onto this this mental</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.359" end="01:04:29.520" style="s2">experience that i&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.799" end="01:04:30.319" style="s2">so yes we we have a huge capacity to</p>

<p begin="01:04:30.319" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">data from whatever it is we&#39;re focusing</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.160" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">on because of the human face thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">the the neural summoning that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:38.400" style="s2">always uh checking for uh so as a result</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.000" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.400" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">if you take that focus and you put it</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:43.280" style="s2">somewhere else you&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:45.599" style="s2"> and feel and do you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.280" end="01:04:45.599" style="s2">explain</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:54.319" style="s2">quips would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:57.599" style="s2">question on overclocking</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.319" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">um sure um what was it</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.599" end="01:05:01.119" style="s2">i think me and anjan had similar</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">questions so i might read out both of</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.119" end="01:05:08.160" style="s2">ours if that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:08.799" style="s2">sorry just your avatar is killing me my</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.160" end="01:05:11.680" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:13.440" style="s2">um uh i think yeah i said uh can we</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.680" end="01:05:16.000" style="s2">overclock the brain by using future tech</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">to manage and mitigate these limitations</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.000" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">uh overclocking uh yeah overclocking</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:20.240" style="s2">basically means consuming more</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">biochemistry</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.240" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">um so as long as you have this like tube</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:25.359" style="s2">of glucose that&#39;s just dumped right</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.160" end="01:05:27.359" style="s2">directly into your neck when you</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.359" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">overclock it then maybe</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.359" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">i was about to say because someone said</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">just strap heat six to your head quickly</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:36.480" style="s2">but um i i imagine it would be more</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:39.839" style="s2">complex than that you would have yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.480" end="01:05:41.599" style="s2">biology uh heat thermodynamic</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.839" end="01:05:42.960" style="s2">many different factors to to actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.599" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">manage and mitigate</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.960" end="01:05:46.559" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a lot if you don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">daniel i was just about to type in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:52.640" style="s2">second question may i ask you</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">go for it um my second question is it</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.640" end="01:05:54.960" style="s2">seems like</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:56.720" style="s2">the limitation hacks that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.960" end="01:05:59.359" style="s2">mentioning on how the brain</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.720" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">has gotten or gotten away with observing</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.359" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">so much with so little data</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">um lean it leans heavily on</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">multiple brains interacting you said</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:09.119" style="s2">mentioned like these emotional outbursts</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.119" end="01:06:13.280" style="s2">affecting wants and needs and desires</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:16.400" style="s2">upon other</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.280" end="01:06:17.200" style="s2">you know interactive brains does do</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.400" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">these hacks</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.200" end="01:06:20.799" style="s2">fall apart in a hypothetical situation</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:23.200" style="s2">where there is exactly one brain in</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.799" end="01:06:23.200" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.280" end="01:06:28.079" style="s2">uh the thing about uh i mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.640" end="01:06:30.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a hypothetical</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.079" end="01:06:32.559" style="s2">fun thought experiment that you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.000" end="01:06:34.799" style="s2">control and i&#39;ve seen some of the more</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.559" end="01:06:36.000" style="s2">barbaric attempts at trying to recreate</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.799" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">that experiment</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.000" end="01:06:40.160" style="s2">um if you put someone in solitary</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:43.200" style="s2">confinement for example</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.160" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">or someone is born without the ability</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.200" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">to engage</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:49.520" style="s2">in um seeing or hearing or their sensory</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">information is gone so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.520" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">close proximity</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.559" end="01:06:53.599" style="s2">to that scenario where a person is born</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:57.039" style="s2">completely sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.599" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">sense dead uh yet they&#39;re alive</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.039" end="01:07:04.160" style="s2">so in those cases because the brain</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:07.280" style="s2">the brain did not evolve on its own</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.160" end="01:07:09.200" style="s2">in isolation in a vacuum it is carrying</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.280" end="01:07:10.720" style="s2">the perceptions the instructions and all</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.200" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">of the equilibriums</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">um that that shaped it it&#39;s carrying it</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:17.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s still going to operate in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:19.359" style="s2">human sense looking for those human</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.200" end="01:07:22.799" style="s2">things engaging in the human ways</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.359" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">um because the brain really does have</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.799" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">its own opinion on how things should be</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.839" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">perceived</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">memetic caper would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.920" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:40.640" style="s2">yeah um so if our brain&#39;s output</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:41.760" style="s2">is merely tactics for summoning more</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.640" end="01:07:44.000" style="s2">neurons</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.760" end="01:07:45.520" style="s2">might such tactics take on a life of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.000" end="01:07:48.480" style="s2">their own</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.520" end="01:07:50.240" style="s2">are symbols merely a byproduct or might</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.480" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">they be the instantiation</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.240" end="01:07:54.880" style="s2">of neural summoning tactics abstracted</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:58.640" style="s2">from individual brains</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.880" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">right so the thing about um and that</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.640" end="01:08:02.480" style="s2">that goes into some of my earlier</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.119" end="01:08:05.280" style="s2">theories regarding</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.480" end="01:08:05.760" style="s2">the formation of morality um and why</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.280" end="01:08:07.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.760" end="01:08:09.760" style="s2">thing kind of keeps happening to us and</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.520" end="01:08:12.480" style="s2">why we even do normal myths at all</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.760" end="01:08:14.720" style="s2">we know that neuromyths the collection</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.480" end="01:08:17.759" style="s2">of symbols that do make up neuromyths</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.720" end="01:08:20.799" style="s2">do lead to pretty wild-ass behavior</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.759" end="01:08:21.600" style="s2">so yes what happens is when we make</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.799" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">these symbols</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.600" end="01:08:24.960" style="s2">in our mind and then we have our</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:26.239" style="s2">behavior coming out and it&#39;s attracting</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.960" end="01:08:27.600" style="s2">more neurons because that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.239" end="01:08:29.199" style="s2">ultimately selecting for</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.600" end="01:08:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s going to create more symbols that</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.199" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">we have to manage and if that symbol</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.040" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">just happens to</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">lead or represent or make a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:38.319" style="s2">people act a certain way repeatedly</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:40.000" style="s2">we&#39;re going to rely on that symbol</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.319" end="01:08:42.799" style="s2">this is this is why you see religions</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.000" end="01:08:45.040" style="s2">use religious symbology all the damn</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.799" end="01:08:48.319" style="s2">time it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very quick it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.040" end="01:08:51.759" style="s2">very quick way to pass</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.319" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">that neuron summoning lesson</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.759" end="01:08:55.359" style="s2">without having to reteach it over and</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">over and over again per generation you</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.359" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">just simply pass the symbol down to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:01.040" style="s2">next generation and poof</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:02.000" style="s2">everything is already encoded ready to</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.040" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">go locked in</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.000" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">programmed in ready to rock um so even</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.560" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">that is an efficiency so</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:10.159" style="s2">these symbols do take lives of their own</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:10.159" style="s2">yes that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.159" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">um andrew you had a question earlier i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">just going to paste it again</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:23.199" style="s2">in the chat would you like to ask it</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:25.600" style="s2">about drugs and or meditation oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.199" end="01:09:26.400" style="s2">uh because you&#39;re talking about uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.600" end="01:09:29.440" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.400" end="01:09:32.400" style="s2">reality like the brain can&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.440" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">uh doesn&#39;t have objective reality or i</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.400" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">was wondering if drug if you think</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.000" end="01:09:37.440" style="s2">that drugs and or like meditation is</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:39.759" style="s2">like an attempt</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.440" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">to have objective reality and is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.759" end="01:09:45.839" style="s2">youthful</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">it kind so i think uh think of it like</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.839" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">this um this camera that&#39;s looking at me</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:52.319" style="s2">right now you see</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.239" end="01:09:53.359" style="s2">a square right so everything in this</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.319" end="01:09:55.280" style="s2">square is</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.359" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">kind of me except this stuff this is not</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:09:58.080" style="s2">me um and then everything outside of</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">that square is</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.080" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">who knows what it is it could be</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:02.480" style="s2">anything all i have to do is move my</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:04.640" style="s2">camera and you see it but you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.480" end="01:10:06.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a limitation to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.640" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">information you can take in from this</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.560" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">square</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:10.480" style="s2">if i modify the electronics on that</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.600" end="01:10:13.040" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.480" end="01:10:14.800" style="s2">i might get a different interpretation i</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.040" end="01:10:15.679" style="s2">could get a different filter a color a</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.800" end="01:10:18.239" style="s2">different hue</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.679" end="01:10:20.159" style="s2">maybe i can put an ar thing on top of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.239" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">maybe i can modify the image somehow if</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.159" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">i start tinkering with the internal</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:25.920" style="s2">electronics but there&#39;s no tinkering</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.679" end="01:10:28.159" style="s2">that&#39;s actually going to expand this box</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.920" end="01:10:30.000" style="s2">you have to physically change the</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.159" end="01:10:31.280" style="s2">hardware of that camera in order to</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">expand the box</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:35.360" style="s2">so if if the drugs aren&#39;t changing the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">hardware or at least</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.360" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">if they are changing the hardware if</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:39.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not changing them in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:40.000" style="s2">meaningful way that allows you to take</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.000" end="01:10:44.400" style="s2">more neurons and thus expand this box</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:46.640" style="s2">um then you&#39;re not going to get</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.400" end="01:10:48.239" style="s2">objective reality because because</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.640" end="01:10:50.800" style="s2">because even before the information hits</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.239" end="01:10:52.239" style="s2">your brain your senses are already doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.800" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">hard filters on the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.239" end="01:10:56.400" style="s2">information you can get</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:57.120" style="s2">um and so as a result you&#39;re you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.400" end="01:11:01.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.120" end="01:11:04.480" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of at the whim of that oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.040" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">uh so like this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.480" end="01:11:08.320" style="s2">uh uh kind of just for me to grasp this</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.280" end="01:11:11.120" style="s2">is it like</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.320" end="01:11:12.480" style="s2">that drugs are just kind of changing the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.120" end="01:11:14.719" style="s2">perception but not</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.480" end="01:11:15.679" style="s2">the objectible reality yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.719" end="01:11:18.719" style="s2">correct yes</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.679" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">so the drugs are changing</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.719" end="01:11:22.320" style="s2">they are physically changing the brain</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">too lsd is notorious for that</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.320" end="01:11:27.600" style="s2">um and there has been endless amounts of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:28.880" style="s2">studying into lsd to try to do exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.600" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.880" end="01:11:32.880" style="s2">uh between the germans and the cia they</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">were dumping lsd on every goddamn living</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.880" end="01:11:35.520" style="s2">thing on this planet</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:37.120" style="s2">in the hopes to create a super brain</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.520" end="01:11:38.640" style="s2">that could see objective reality every</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.120" end="01:11:39.520" style="s2">single one of those experiments failed</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.640" end="01:11:41.760" style="s2">by the way</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.520" end="01:11:43.679" style="s2">um they did not work at all and they got</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.760" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">into more disastrous</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.679" end="01:11:48.320" style="s2">and insane and insidious types of</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:49.840" style="s2">trialing in order to try and somehow</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.320" end="01:11:51.840" style="s2">keep that hope alive</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.840" end="01:11:53.440" style="s2">but they&#39;re unlimited money</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.840" end="01:11:54.320" style="s2">unaccountable assholes</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.440" end="01:11:56.080" style="s2">they&#39;re getting to the point where</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.320" end="01:11:56.719" style="s2">they&#39;re dumping lsd and kids for god&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.080" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">sakes</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.719" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2">so it was it was a disaster and</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:01.120" style="s2">they never achieved that dream they</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">never got it</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.120" end="01:12:05.199" style="s2">so um we could argue that perhaps their</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:07.679" style="s2">techniques were wrong which</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.199" end="01:12:09.520" style="s2">they were we could make the assumption</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.679" end="01:12:09.840" style="s2">that perhaps a better chemical needs to</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.520" end="01:12:11.520" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.840" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">evolved and that will magically change</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">the brain maybe crispr will do it maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.120" end="01:12:17.679" style="s2">this will do it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">yeah that&#39;ll do it um for sure i mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.679" end="01:12:21.280" style="s2">i know the neanderthal brain process</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.600" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">drink a drink um</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.280" end="01:12:25.199" style="s2">we we use crispr for that and it does</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:27.360" style="s2">physically change the brain the neurons</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.199" end="01:12:29.440" style="s2">themselves look like popcorn</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.360" end="01:12:30.400" style="s2">like they don&#39;t look that&#39;s not an axon</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.440" end="01:12:33.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not a dendrite</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.400" end="01:12:35.679" style="s2">it&#39;s popcorn nobody expected that um</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.679" end="01:12:37.600" style="s2">so yeah you can crisper and change stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.679" end="01:12:39.280" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the point here the point</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.600" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">is you still have to account</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.280" end="01:12:43.520" style="s2">for the for the energy consumption and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.760" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">the thermal management as well</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.520" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">just you know changing the brain itself</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:48.480" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough you have to you have to get</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">the equilibrium of everything that makes</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.480" end="01:12:52.560" style="s2">the brain possible also right at the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:54.960" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.560" end="01:12:56.880" style="s2">next week can we do the dark stella on</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.960" end="01:12:59.760" style="s2">acid</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.880" end="01:13:00.800" style="s2">i can do this the whole study on it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.760" end="01:13:03.360" style="s2">i think it might be</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.800" end="01:13:06.400" style="s2">the timing might be good everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.360" end="01:13:06.400" style="s2">on acid oh i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.719" end="01:13:12.640" style="s2">okay uh second last question</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.760" end="01:13:14.400" style="s2">um angen you had a question about</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.640" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">planning our lives in light of</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.400" end="01:13:18.800" style="s2">some of the things that pat says can you</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:20.800" style="s2">ask that question</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.800" end="01:13:22.800" style="s2">hey thanks pat that was an incredible</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.800" end="01:13:24.239" style="s2">lecture um</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.800" end="01:13:26.159" style="s2">i&#39;ll just read my question um you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">mentioned that the coming century</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.159" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">is a century of psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:30.800" style="s2">neuroscience that it&#39;s hidden inflection</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:32.640" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.800" end="01:13:34.560" style="s2">why what&#39;s the inflection point and what</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.640" end="01:13:39.360" style="s2">are the implications for that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.560" end="01:13:42.719" style="s2">in planning our own lives yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.360" end="01:13:44.640" style="s2">the inflection point is that we have</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.719" end="01:13:46.000" style="s2">done the maximum amount of neuron</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.640" end="01:13:48.640" style="s2">summoning we can do</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.000" end="01:13:51.199" style="s2">in our empire building games and with</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.640" end="01:13:54.239" style="s2">the advent of the nuclear weapon</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.199" end="01:13:57.040" style="s2">our ability to explore more neuron</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.239" end="01:14:00.480" style="s2">summoning has completely evaporated</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.040" end="01:14:02.480" style="s2">meaning we cannot use geopolitics to</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.480" end="01:14:04.000" style="s2">solve our neuron shortage problems</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.480" end="01:14:06.320" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.000" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">and when we do play geopolitics to solve</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.320" end="01:14:10.880" style="s2">our neuron shortage problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.159" end="01:14:11.520" style="s2">uh what ultimately ends up happening is</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.880" end="01:14:14.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.520" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">it results in dunbar number violations</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.400" end="01:14:17.920" style="s2">and cultural conflict and unstable stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:19.520" style="s2">there i mean i can point to any number</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.920" end="01:14:21.120" style="s2">of genocides in any</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.520" end="01:14:22.560" style="s2">number of places i&#39;ll throw a dart</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.120" end="01:14:23.199" style="s2">somewhere in a genocide happen because</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.560" end="01:14:26.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.199" end="01:14:29.040" style="s2">of cultural conflict um so we&#39;ve uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.800" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve hit our hard limits here and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.040" end="01:14:31.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve double</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:33.199" style="s2">tripled quadruple down on trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.920" end="01:14:36.080" style="s2">create good enough</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.199" end="01:14:37.360" style="s2">neurons with silicon and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.080" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">going okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.360" end="01:14:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s been doing some stuff but the</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.880" end="01:14:42.320" style="s2">real win here for silicon</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.480" end="01:14:43.679" style="s2">is the fact that a.i came or neural</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.320" end="01:14:45.840" style="s2">networks came on board</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.679" end="01:14:47.520" style="s2">i mean send the name neural network the</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.840" end="01:14:50.320" style="s2">bastard child of the neuron</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.520" end="01:14:52.080" style="s2">um so what this is allowing us to do is</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.320" end="01:14:52.719" style="s2">it&#39;s allowing us to overcome certain</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.080" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">parts</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.719" end="01:14:56.080" style="s2">of our neuron shortage not all of them</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.199" end="01:14:58.080" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.080" end="01:14:59.760" style="s2">just certain parts of it and the parts</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.080" end="01:15:03.040" style="s2">that it allows us to cover</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.760" end="01:15:05.280" style="s2">right now is the genomic space because</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.040" end="01:15:08.159" style="s2">there&#39;s so much data associated with uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.280" end="01:15:08.800" style="s2">dna research and so much about genomics</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.159" end="01:15:11.600" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.800" end="01:15:12.159" style="s2">the art of the the artificial neurons uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.600" end="01:15:15.440" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.159" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">assisting us into going into that space</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.440" end="01:15:18.800" style="s2">and once we start connecting genomics to</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.920" end="01:15:20.239" style="s2">connectomics</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.800" end="01:15:22.080" style="s2">and we can start making predictions on</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.239" end="01:15:22.719" style="s2">that we&#39;re at the inflection point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.080" end="01:15:25.679" style="s2">it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.719" end="01:15:26.640" style="s2">right so um what does this mean for our</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.679" end="01:15:30.640" style="s2">daily lives</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.640" end="01:15:34.320" style="s2">uh i mean if you&#39;re really close</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.640" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">to the stuff that i&#39;m talking about um</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.320" end="01:15:37.679" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t hurt to listen to some of</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:39.280" style="s2">these lectures first</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.679" end="01:15:40.719" style="s2">uh before you start playing crisper</p>

<p begin="01:15:40.719" end="01:15:45.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve been there i can tell you how it</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.000" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">goes um but the uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.040" end="01:15:48.400" style="s2">for the average person who&#39;s looking at</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:50.800" style="s2">this stuff um</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.400" end="01:15:52.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason i&#39;m promoting alchemy</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.800" end="01:15:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the safest thing you can embrace</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.880" end="01:15:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the safest neuro myth you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.400" end="01:15:58.480" style="s2">embrace</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.520" end="01:16:00.239" style="s2">uh because you&#39;re going to see chimeric</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.480" end="01:16:02.400" style="s2">cognition you&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.239" end="01:16:03.679" style="s2">bots running around that look and act</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.400" end="01:16:05.600" style="s2">just like humans</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.679" end="01:16:06.880" style="s2">um you&#39;re going to see humans going</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.600" end="01:16:09.679" style="s2">psychotic</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.880" end="01:16:11.679" style="s2">in this place at the same time uh so the</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.679" end="01:16:14.080" style="s2">alchemical neuro myth is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.679" end="01:16:16.640" style="s2">useful way to navigate this upcoming</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.080" end="01:16:18.239" style="s2">insanity when we start dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:20.320" style="s2">different when we lose our we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.239" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">to lose our monopoly on sentience</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.320" end="01:16:25.040" style="s2">um and when we lose that monopoly um we</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:27.199" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that looks like</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.040" end="01:16:28.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to act about that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.199" end="01:16:30.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not i don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna act</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.800" end="01:16:32.560" style="s2">very kindly about that</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.480" end="01:16:33.600" style="s2">uh and so these chimeric brains and</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.560" end="01:16:35.280" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.600" end="01:16:37.600" style="s2">ai brains are going to be running around</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.280" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">making interpretations of law and</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.600" end="01:16:40.159" style="s2">morality and they&#39;re going to influence</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.040" end="01:16:41.760" style="s2">us and we&#39;re going to be like where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.159" end="01:16:44.960" style="s2">the democratic process</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.760" end="01:16:46.560" style="s2">giraffe slug raven brain um and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.960" end="01:16:49.120" style="s2">going to be like well what</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.560" end="01:16:50.960" style="s2">i have no idea and well who do you even</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.120" end="01:16:54.159" style="s2">petition in such a situation</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.960" end="01:16:55.360" style="s2">uh so so the the alchemical neuro myth</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.159" end="01:16:58.159" style="s2">is a good start</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.360" end="01:16:59.840" style="s2">to um start looking into in order to</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.159" end="01:17:02.239" style="s2">keep your sanity in this in this</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.840" end="01:17:05.520" style="s2">mess that&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.239" end="01:17:08.159" style="s2">all right uh key bring us home with the</p>

<p begin="01:17:21.840" end="01:17:25.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t need to be the last question i</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.600" end="01:17:27.040" style="s2">really do not i&#39;m gonna say that out</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.280" end="01:17:30.159" style="s2">loud right now</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.040" end="01:17:32.080" style="s2">like i understand this tradition</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.159" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">peter referred to it as a ritual i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.080" end="01:17:34.000" style="s2">just putting it out there in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.360" end="01:17:36.159" style="s2">recording</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.000" end="01:17:37.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t need to be the last question</p>

<p begin="01:17:37.520" end="01:17:40.960" style="s2">like you can ignore my question if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.800" end="01:17:42.080" style="s2">want it&#39;s okay um yep</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.960" end="01:17:43.520" style="s2">and then there was something about</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.080" end="01:17:44.800" style="s2">straightening the picture that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.520" end="01:17:46.400" style="s2">great you know it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.800" end="01:17:48.239" style="s2">you know behind you yeah though that</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.400" end="01:17:50.719" style="s2">came up a couple of times i&#39;m sorry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.239" end="01:17:51.760" style="s2">it comes into my brain um while i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.719" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">reading and then there was also a</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.760" end="01:17:54.719" style="s2">question by todd</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.960" end="01:17:56.000" style="s2">about temperature differentials and i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.719" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">like to say that i value air</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.000" end="01:17:58.080" style="s2">conditioning a lot now and my friend has</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:01.199" style="s2">said the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.080" end="01:18:03.199" style="s2">so thank you for that um i will read</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.199" end="01:18:04.320" style="s2">todd&#39;s question because i appreciated it</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.199" end="01:18:06.640" style="s2">a lot which was</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.320" end="01:18:08.159" style="s2">um are there any psychological states</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.640" end="01:18:10.239" style="s2">that improve our temperature</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.159" end="01:18:11.280" style="s2">differentials i&#39;d assume anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.239" end="01:18:13.360" style="s2">depression and other</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.280" end="01:18:14.800" style="s2">mental states disabled capacity i really</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.360" end="01:18:15.600" style="s2">like that question i just want to keep</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.800" end="01:18:18.239" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.600" end="01:18:19.280" style="s2">there while coming to the question that</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.239" end="01:18:21.840" style="s2">i asked which was</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.280" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">oh i wanted to thank you for speaking of</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.840" end="01:18:24.239" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:27.040" style="s2">intentional about our thoughts that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.239" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">been really important to me um</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.040" end="01:18:30.800" style="s2">recently in the past and continuing</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:34.239" style="s2">onwards the question is</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.800" end="01:18:35.199" style="s2">you mentioned are we optimizing for</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.239" end="01:18:38.320" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.199" end="01:18:42.239" style="s2">and getting to know one another um</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.320" end="01:18:45.679" style="s2">or for birthday cake or</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:48.640" style="s2">or um the attempt okay so</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.679" end="01:18:50.560" style="s2">the attempt to see objective reality um</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:51.840" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.560" end="01:18:55.280" style="s2">much appreciated knowing that we only</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.840" end="01:18:56.400" style="s2">see 0.000 however many zeros six percent</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.280" end="01:18:59.440" style="s2">of photons</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.400" end="01:19:00.080" style="s2">um and wanting to understand reality</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.440" end="01:19:03.440" style="s2">more great</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.080" end="01:19:04.800" style="s2">um do we do that via neuronsemine which</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.440" end="01:19:06.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve already said</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.800" end="01:19:08.640" style="s2">a lot about which i&#39;m still processing</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.640" end="01:19:09.600" style="s2">to be honest or do we do that through</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.640" end="01:19:11.040" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.600" end="01:19:12.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s great because andrew brought</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.040" end="01:19:14.159" style="s2">that up but is it a worthwhile goal even</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.960" end="01:19:18.880" style="s2">to be able</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.159" end="01:19:18.880" style="s2">to see objective reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.600" end="01:19:24.239" style="s2">right so um first uh the first part</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.320" end="01:19:25.920" style="s2">about modifying brain temperature</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.239" end="01:19:27.520" style="s2">uh yeah we actually do that all the time</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.920" end="01:19:28.800" style="s2">whenever we go to sleep you go to sleep</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.520" end="01:19:31.600" style="s2">and your brain temperature goes big</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.800" end="01:19:32.159" style="s2">it goes down um and then when you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.600" end="01:19:33.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.159" end="01:19:35.840" style="s2">anesthetics when they knock you out your</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.760" end="01:19:36.320" style="s2">brain temperature goes down um so there</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.840" end="01:19:38.400" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.320" end="01:19:40.000" style="s2">i&#39;m sure with those two things there are</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.400" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">drugs that can emulate</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.000" end="01:19:43.280" style="s2">that maybe even being drunk brings your</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:45.840" style="s2">brain temperature down um</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.280" end="01:19:47.280" style="s2">but also you know it&#39;s it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.840" end="01:19:48.800" style="s2">just target the brain temperature</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.280" end="01:19:51.040" style="s2">the reason the temperature is going down</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.800" end="01:19:53.760" style="s2">is because the the bio</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.040" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">the biochemical fuel is burning less um</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.760" end="01:19:57.760" style="s2">so as a result temperature goes down</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:19:59.120" style="s2">so you&#39;re not engaging in symbol</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.760" end="01:20:00.560" style="s2">management any longer</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.120" end="01:20:02.800" style="s2">or at least another part of your brain</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.560" end="01:20:04.640" style="s2">is going into single symbol management</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.800" end="01:20:06.400" style="s2">mode while the other parts don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.640" end="01:20:09.600" style="s2">so there&#39;s there is definitely</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.400" end="01:20:12.719" style="s2">reproducible um</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.600" end="01:20:13.840" style="s2">biochemical evidence of of modifying</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.719" end="01:20:15.360" style="s2">brain temperature</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.840" end="01:20:18.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s as simple as</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.360" end="01:20:21.280" style="s2">willpower i suspect there may</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.000" end="01:20:21.600" style="s2">be some willpower trip tips that you can</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.280" end="01:20:24.400" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.600" end="01:20:26.000" style="s2">that can either reduce or bring it up um</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.400" end="01:20:28.239" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a state of anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.000" end="01:20:29.920" style="s2">for sure because your brain temperature</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.239" end="01:20:31.520" style="s2">is going up because your endocrine</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.920" end="01:20:32.239" style="s2">system is on fire your adrenaline&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.520" end="01:20:34.560" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.239" end="01:20:36.639" style="s2">so you&#39;re you&#39;re getting more details</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.560" end="01:20:38.880" style="s2">about reality so that in turn is</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.639" end="01:20:40.719" style="s2">burning more glucose and oxygen um so</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.880" end="01:20:43.600" style="s2">yes that will increase the temperature</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.719" end="01:20:44.719" style="s2">of the brain but but your fluctuation is</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.600" end="01:20:46.880" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.719" end="01:20:48.639" style="s2">uh within that one c band for the most</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.880" end="01:20:51.520" style="s2">part for the most part</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.639" end="01:20:53.280" style="s2">um uh if it goes beyond that then you</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.520" end="01:20:54.159" style="s2">lose 70 of all information that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.280" end="01:20:57.600" style="s2">on anyway</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.159" end="01:20:59.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s uh it&#39;s yes there are there are</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.600" end="01:21:01.199" style="s2">ramifications about brain temperature</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.440" end="01:21:03.199" style="s2">and depression for sure</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.199" end="01:21:04.560" style="s2">then the second about optimizing it</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.199" end="01:21:06.239" style="s2">trying to see reality are we</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.560" end="01:21:08.560" style="s2">are we optimizing for each other are we</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.239" end="01:21:10.560" style="s2">optimizing for birthday gig</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.560" end="01:21:13.280" style="s2">i would say why not both but i think</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.560" end="01:21:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s we are optimizing for each other to</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.280" end="01:21:16.960" style="s2">get the birthday</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.080" end="01:21:17.600" style="s2">cake um because to get a birthday cake</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.960" end="01:21:19.520" style="s2">is a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.600" end="01:21:21.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of work you gotta gotta farm</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.520" end="01:21:23.360" style="s2">the grain you gotta beat down the grain</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.120" end="01:21:24.560" style="s2">you gotta cook the damn thing but you</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.360" end="01:21:25.840" style="s2">gotta get the logs to cook it then you</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.560" end="01:21:27.760" style="s2">gotta start the fire but then you need</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.840" end="01:21:29.040" style="s2">the metal to start to fire okay well now</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.760" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">i&#39;m cooking it but then i need a</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.040" end="01:21:33.199" style="s2">the place that can actually do the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:35.679" style="s2">cooking and and now i need uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.199" end="01:21:37.199" style="s2">i need a cow so i can get some milk to</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.679" end="01:21:38.560" style="s2">get some butter in that thing too and i</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.199" end="01:21:41.520" style="s2">got to go find a cow and</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.560" end="01:21:42.159" style="s2">you know you know convince it to give me</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.520" end="01:21:44.400" style="s2">milk</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.159" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">and then i gotta let it age and process</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.400" end="01:21:48.320" style="s2">it there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:49.600" style="s2">complicated economic factors that make</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.320" end="01:21:51.040" style="s2">that birthday kick</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.600" end="01:21:54.719" style="s2">and so in order to get that birthday</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.040" end="01:21:56.400" style="s2">cake we had to select for ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.719" end="01:21:57.840" style="s2">because we need this economy to work in</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.400" end="01:21:59.760" style="s2">order to make the birthday cake</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.840" end="01:22:01.920" style="s2">so by selecting for ourselves that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.760" end="01:22:03.360" style="s2">we got it um so not actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.920" end="01:22:05.679" style="s2">if you&#39;re optimizing for the birthday</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.360" end="01:22:06.960" style="s2">cake think of it like this right the</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.679" end="01:22:08.639" style="s2">more complicated like</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.960" end="01:22:10.560" style="s2">i say that entropy is the process of</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.639" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">reducing down to irreducibles if this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.560" end="01:22:14.800" style="s2">your base state this is like</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.840" end="01:22:16.560" style="s2">atoms right there&#39;s a small tribe like</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.800" end="01:22:18.639" style="s2">the further we get from the base state</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.560" end="01:22:20.719" style="s2">the more unstable things become</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.639" end="01:22:22.159" style="s2">before entropy comes by and just grinds</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.719" end="01:22:25.600" style="s2">us back down</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.159" end="01:22:27.199" style="s2">so the birthday cake is like like here</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.600" end="01:22:29.520" style="s2">right you need to have a functioning</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.199" end="01:22:31.840" style="s2">civilization to make a birthday cake</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.520" end="01:22:33.679" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s quite the dependency um</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.840" end="01:22:35.600" style="s2">but to get that functioning civilization</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.679" end="01:22:38.560" style="s2">you you need people selecting for</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.600" end="01:22:40.719" style="s2">each other and so the the last part of</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.560" end="01:22:42.560" style="s2">that question is this even worthwhile is</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.719" end="01:22:45.040" style="s2">is the civilization that generates</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.560" end="01:22:47.840" style="s2">birthday cakes worthwhile</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.040" end="01:22:49.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think so but that&#39;s just me um i</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.840" end="01:22:51.360" style="s2">i think civilization can do some other</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.760" end="01:22:52.400" style="s2">interesting things that we&#39;ve forgotten</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.360" end="01:22:54.159" style="s2">how to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.400" end="01:22:56.239" style="s2">uh maybe it&#39;d be nice to take a break</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.159" end="01:22:59.679" style="s2">from the birthday cake every so often</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.239" end="01:23:00.159" style="s2">um but that&#39;s a matter of personal taste</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.679" end="01:23:02.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.159" end="01:23:03.760" style="s2">you know you can dismiss that i think</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.480" end="01:23:05.120" style="s2">it&#39;s i think it&#39;s probably up to each</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.760" end="01:23:06.480" style="s2">individual to figure out what it is they</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.120" end="01:23:07.520" style="s2">want from the civilization because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.480" end="01:23:08.880" style="s2">the only game in town</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.520" end="01:23:11.360" style="s2">so you better you know make peace with</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.880" end="01:23:11.360" style="s2">it somehow</p>
