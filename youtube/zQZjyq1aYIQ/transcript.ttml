<p begin="00:00:04.049" end="00:00:08.099" style="s2">lot of books that my friends keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">telling me sound really cool and so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:11.610" style="s2">always recommended that I share some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:13.259" style="s2">what I&#39;m learning from these books and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.610" end="00:00:15.299" style="s2">videos so other people can understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.259" end="00:00:17.760" style="s2">them too so the book that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.299" end="00:00:20.010" style="s2">share with you today is this one social</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.760" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">physics how good ideas spread the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.010" end="00:00:24.119" style="s2">lessons from a new science by Alex</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:26.789" style="s2">pentland now Alex puntland as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:29.730" style="s2">professor at MIT and help set up one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.789" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">their media labs and he&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.730" end="00:00:33.870" style="s2">considered to be one of the best data</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">scientists in the world so what he does</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.870" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">in this book is he explores the question</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:42.360" style="s2">how can we take all of the data that has</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">now possible to gather and look at human</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:47.160" style="s2">interactions as if it was a physical</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">system and then watch how ideas flow</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">from one person to another two best</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">figure out how to increase creativity</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">and innovation and productivity with an</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">organization or how to optimize say</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">certain things that want to that one</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">might want to design for in a city or in</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">a society and so the book is really a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2">great book for exploring this very</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">question I think it&#39;s probably the best</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.200" end="00:01:15.450" style="s2">book out there for looking at how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:17.640" style="s2">model social systems entirely using data</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.450" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">driven approaches so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.640" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2">that pentland does throughout the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">that I find really exciting is he and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">his collaborators which is a group of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">PhD students over the Syria over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:34.470" style="s2">last 20 years is they have found ways to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">gather data from human interactions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.470" end="00:01:40.110" style="s2">then take that data and then model the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">social system as if it was a physical</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:44.759" style="s2">system and they&#39;re able to then take the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:48.329" style="s2">knowledge of the gain and say things</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.759" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">about how frequently someone may speak</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.329" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">in a conversation how frequently other</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">people may interrupt what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">composition is of different people</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">speaking so if there are five people in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">a group maybe three of the people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">speaking eighty percent of the time and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">the other two people hardly speak at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">looking at those kinds of relationships</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">that are embedded in the behavior of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">people themselves and then from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.000" style="s2">mathematical relationships between the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:14.650" style="s2">data they gather the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.000" end="00:02:16.810" style="s2">able to discover really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.650" end="00:02:18.670" style="s2">things about how the social systems work</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.810" end="00:02:21.310" style="s2">and then they can introduce new</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.670" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">management frameworks information</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.310" end="00:02:27.100" style="s2">architectures creative design processes</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:28.630" style="s2">or in the case of say a city where there</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.100" end="00:02:31.570" style="s2">might be a disease that&#39;s spreading from</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.630" end="00:02:34.270" style="s2">person to person to try to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.570" end="00:02:37.150" style="s2">spread of the disease by using real-time</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.270" end="00:02:39.100" style="s2">data to tell people using visual</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.150" end="00:02:41.470" style="s2">representations of the data of the data</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.100" end="00:02:43.630" style="s2">flow where they should go that their</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.470" end="00:02:45.580" style="s2">least likely to become infected by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.630" end="00:02:48.610" style="s2">disease and this is a way for people</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.580" end="00:02:51.190" style="s2">just like how we use traffic congestion</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.610" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">data now using something like Google</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.190" end="00:02:55.060" style="s2">Maps to tell us that we should take the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:57.130" style="s2">bridge that goes over the water instead</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.060" end="00:02:59.170" style="s2">of taking the overpass that goes down</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.130" end="00:03:01.870" style="s2">through downtown because we&#39;ll avoid</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.170" end="00:03:04.030" style="s2">traffic in exactly the same way people</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.870" end="00:03:05.620" style="s2">can use real-time data to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.030" end="00:03:08.020" style="s2">to avoid becoming part of an epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.620" end="00:03:11.500" style="s2">which means that public health officials</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.020" end="00:03:12.850" style="s2">could stop an epidemic in its tracks so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.500" end="00:03:14.860" style="s2">this is the kind of thing of the book</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.850" end="00:03:17.410" style="s2">explores and if you&#39;re a social</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.860" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">scientist or a marketer or an urban</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.410" end="00:03:22.690" style="s2">planner or a campaigner who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:25.450" style="s2">spread ideas increase creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.690" end="00:03:28.810" style="s2">innovation in your organization make</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.450" end="00:03:30.940" style="s2">your city or your society safer or</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.810" end="00:03:33.250" style="s2">healthier the next book provides an</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.940" end="00:03:36.010" style="s2">excellent overview of the future of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.250" end="00:03:38.110" style="s2">social science so that&#39;s it that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.010" end="00:03:39.340" style="s2">I&#39;ll say for now I recommend you go</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.110" end="00:03:41.799" style="s2">ahead and get the book yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.340" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">again it&#39;s social physics biology</p>
