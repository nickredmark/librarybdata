<p begin="00:00:01.159" end="00:00:07.560" style="s2">this is my video response to the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.279" end="00:00:10.410" style="s2">the third episode of revolution Z</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:14.219" style="s2">entitled vision meritocracy and income</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.410" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">and in it Michael Albert talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.219" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">it would be unfair to base your income</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2">on things like your any talent the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.490" end="00:00:24.390" style="s2">situation you grew up in our genetics</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:26.939" style="s2">our luck the tools available to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.390" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">because it&#39;s inherently unfair but then</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.939" end="00:00:31.140" style="s2">he goes on to say that what we should</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">base income on is the duration of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.140" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">work you perform the intensity of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">work you perform and the owner√≠s</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">conditions in which you perform it and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">would say that&#39;s all able saf because we</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">all have very different abilities for to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">be able to work for a length of time to</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:52.620" style="s2">be able to work at a certain intensity</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">and what conditions are onerous for us</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.620" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">we are all unique individuals and so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">don&#39;t we can all run the same distance</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">we can all run for the same intensity we</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">can&#39;t the same conditions such as</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">temperature are going to affect us</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.460" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">differently I can&#39;t work under</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:10.409" style="s2">fluorescent lights because it&#39;s near</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">torture for me for said that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">owner&#39;s condition to me but not for</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">society so you put me in that you would</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">need to pay me more but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:19.110" style="s2">really what he&#39;s talking about he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">saying well fluorescent lights aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.110" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">onerous so no no one&#39;s getting paid more</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:26.070" style="s2">for that and so what would I say what</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">would I say in the new global</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.070" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">cooperative later on when we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:31.740" style="s2">a currency and we don&#39;t have a monetary</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">system and we&#39;re not paying people</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.740" end="00:01:36.119" style="s2">because that&#39;s what the point of not</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">having a monetary system is so how much</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.119" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">do people work they work the amount they</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">want to work you don&#39;t get to dictate</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">how much anybody else works so if the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">amount that brings you joy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">fulfillment is ten hours a week you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">doing 10 hours a week if the amount that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:53.700" style="s2">brings you joy fulfilment is 80 hours a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:54.990" style="s2">week you&#39;re doing 80 hours but neither</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.700" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">of those people get a dictate that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.990" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">everybody else does that the person only</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:01:59.850" style="s2">doing 10 doesn&#39;t say everyone else has</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">to only do 10 because they&#39;re making me</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.850" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">look bad the person doing 80 you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:06.149" style="s2">say everyone else has to do 80 because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:07.320" style="s2">can do it and it&#39;s easy think about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.149" end="00:02:10.709" style="s2">much work we&#39;d get accomplished if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.320" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">all did 80 and so tapping into what</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.709" end="00:02:15.270" style="s2">brings you joy and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:17.400" style="s2">what fulfills you is how we get the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.270" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">tasks accomplished because that is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.400" end="00:02:19.860" style="s2">next question well how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:21.480" style="s2">everything done because maybe we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.860" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">get everything done with complete</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.480" end="00:02:25.530" style="s2">enjoyment and so I will link to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:27.030" style="s2">video called how do tasks get</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.530" end="00:02:29.610" style="s2">accomplished that I just put up today</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.030" end="00:02:31.830" style="s2">but this is basically the the one that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.610" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about for a task to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.830" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">accomplished you need these three things</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:36.390" style="s2">to coincide in the same individual they</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:38.010" style="s2">have to be aware of the task needs to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.390" end="00:02:39.600" style="s2">get done they have to have the skills to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.010" end="00:02:41.160" style="s2">accomplish the task and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">have the desire to accomplish the task</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.160" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">and so we talked about income or talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">about paying people cuz they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:50.070" style="s2">a desire to do it I&#39;m saying let&#39;s tap</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:55.710" style="s2">into their desire to do it let&#39;s create</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.070" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">the systems that tell people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.710" end="00:02:59.700" style="s2">to where this go the task needs to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:01.830" style="s2">done but have both the desire and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.700" end="00:03:04.490" style="s2">skill set what needs to get done and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.830" end="00:03:06.600" style="s2">making it available to them let&#39;s create</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.490" end="00:03:08.580" style="s2">education systems that if people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.600" end="00:03:10.680" style="s2">only lacking skill it is very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.580" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">train new people it is within their</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.680" end="00:03:16.380" style="s2">learning style and when we still are</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:19.080" style="s2">lacking when we truly lack desire</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.380" end="00:03:20.610" style="s2">instead of paying people to work X</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.080" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">number of hours under a certain duration</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.610" end="00:03:24.270" style="s2">and condition you ask what would</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:26.130" style="s2">incentivize them if we know we have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.270" end="00:03:27.630" style="s2">certain level of skilled people that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.130" end="00:03:29.850" style="s2">aware a task needs to get done but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.630" end="00:03:32.130" style="s2">still don&#39;t desire but we know what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.850" end="00:03:33.660" style="s2">do desire hey if you all had there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.130" end="00:03:35.070" style="s2">enough of you that like Adele if we give</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.660" end="00:03:36.950" style="s2">you an adult concert would you do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.070" end="00:03:39.000" style="s2">dela said she&#39;s willing to do it then</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.950" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">because that&#39;s her desire that&#39;s her</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.000" end="00:03:42.660" style="s2">sweet spot right she has the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:44.100" style="s2">say who she has the skill to sing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:45.540" style="s2">she&#39;s aware those potholes need to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.100" end="00:03:47.070" style="s2">filled but she&#39;s not filling them so</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.540" end="00:03:49.050" style="s2">we&#39;ll do you fill them and she sings for</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.070" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">you that we tap into something else</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.050" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">that&#39;s an incentive and that is how</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:58.230" style="s2">tasks get accomplished in the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">economy how now that being said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.230" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">in the future that&#39;s utopian future when</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">we&#39;re creating the technological</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:05.940" style="s2">cooperative we need to pay people</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">because people are putting in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.940" end="00:04:09.450" style="s2">time we need we need money in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:12.269" style="s2">current economy and sort of paying</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.450" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">people a living wage beyond a living</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.269" end="00:04:15.510" style="s2">wage because it&#39;s the tech industry and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:17.580" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be able to get more than a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.510" end="00:04:20.549" style="s2">living wage somewhere else but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.580" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">also continually asking not for let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.549" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">say the 1% of our members that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:25.139" style="s2">employed by the co-operative but for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:28.740" style="s2">hundred percent of our member</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.139" end="00:04:31.379" style="s2">how do we deflate the economy how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.740" end="00:04:33.569" style="s2">keep your if your wage is $20,000 how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.379" end="00:04:35.550" style="s2">we make sure you can get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.569" end="00:04:37.860" style="s2">and more for your 20000 instead of less</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.550" end="00:04:40.110" style="s2">and less and less so that you can work</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:42.780" style="s2">less time and get the same level and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:46.110" style="s2">that&#39;s about creative non not-for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.780" end="00:04:49.289" style="s2">systems that help you trade your labor</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.110" end="00:04:52.319" style="s2">in trade time for food for clothing for</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.289" end="00:04:53.939" style="s2">shelter that you don&#39;t have to but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.319" end="00:04:55.229" style="s2">get to voluntarily choose that you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.939" end="00:04:57.419" style="s2">to choose which food system you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.229" end="00:04:58.469" style="s2">part of and you&#39;re never gonna want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.419" end="00:04:59.909" style="s2">be a part of it if you&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.469" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">put in more time and energy than you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.909" end="00:05:04.830" style="s2">currently doing in the current economy</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:06.599" style="s2">so as you can see the amount of time and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.830" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">energy you have to put in and being less</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.599" end="00:05:10.500" style="s2">and less and less the more you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:13.229" style="s2">want to opt in if you make a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">dollars an hour an iPad cost you one</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.229" end="00:05:15.659" style="s2">hour of work in the current economy</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.659" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">us but if an iPad costs you a month&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.409" end="00:05:25.020" style="s2">worth of labor and we can give it to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">for 20 hours of labor then you&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:31.889" style="s2">whatever our version of the iPad is cuz</p>
