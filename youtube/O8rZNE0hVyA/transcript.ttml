<p begin="00:03:16.519" end="00:03:23.810" style="s2">tenth lesson and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:25.940" style="s2">liminal that&#39;s what I guess what I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.810" end="00:03:28.340" style="s2">to say it I put it here because it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.940" end="00:03:29.630" style="s2">the capstone but it&#39;s also the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.340" end="00:03:31.820" style="s2">that bridges you into more advanced</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.630" end="00:03:33.320" style="s2">practice so this is a practice you</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.320" end="00:03:37.580" style="s2">to schedule it in in a few minutes but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:39.950" style="s2">if this is the practice that really its</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.580" end="00:03:42.980" style="s2">growth depends on how all the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.950" end="00:03:45.620" style="s2">practices underneath it are growing so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.980" end="00:03:47.299" style="s2">it grows very very slowly as you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.620" end="00:03:49.700" style="s2">imagine so you have to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.299" end="00:03:51.110" style="s2">patient and take a big-picture view with</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.700" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">respect to what I&#39;m going to teach you</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.110" end="00:03:56.570" style="s2">so what I&#39;m going to teach you is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:04:00.530" style="s2">progeny practice this this is also known</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.570" end="00:04:04.010" style="s2">as a non-duality practice so Praja right</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.530" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">it means wisdom right but it means a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.010" end="00:04:10.750" style="s2">particular kind of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:13.250" style="s2">it means sort of self liberated</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.750" end="00:04:15.500" style="s2">intelligence but not intelligence in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.250" end="00:04:17.239" style="s2">sort of the the the holding of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.500" end="00:04:21.289" style="s2">propositions or belief but the ability</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.239" end="00:04:24.950" style="s2">to see right through illusion and into</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.289" end="00:04:26.030" style="s2">what&#39;s real and to be able to unlock the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.950" end="00:04:27.889" style="s2">world in your identity</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.030" end="00:04:30.500" style="s2">in such a way that you are much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.889" end="00:04:33.139" style="s2">appropriately fitted to it I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.500" end="00:04:34.940" style="s2">about what why a wise person can do not</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.139" end="00:04:36.530" style="s2">so much necessarily that they have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.940" end="00:04:38.389" style="s2">of factual knowledge although that can</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.530" end="00:04:40.760" style="s2">help what happens is they can come into</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.389" end="00:04:42.770" style="s2">a situation and very dynamically and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.760" end="00:04:44.570" style="s2">think about mindfulness being connected</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.770" end="00:04:47.389" style="s2">they are very mindfully connected to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.570" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">themselves to the situation and to other</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.389" end="00:04:51.080" style="s2">people involved in this situation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">they know how to in all this tangled</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.080" end="00:04:56.980" style="s2">ill-defined mess zero in on the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:04:59.690" style="s2">information and not just see it but also</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.980" end="00:05:00.260" style="s2">right Co identified what they think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.690" end="00:05:02.780" style="s2">Mehta</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.260" end="00:05:05.720" style="s2">so that they are most appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.780" end="00:05:09.040" style="s2">fitted to it and you have that and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.720" end="00:05:13.310" style="s2">have that kind of self liberating</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.040" end="00:05:14.930" style="s2">intelligence insight capacity that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.310" end="00:05:16.700" style="s2">so it&#39;s not we don&#39;t have a single word</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.930" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">in English that captures it really well</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.700" end="00:05:24.590" style="s2">this way I like to use the Sanskrit term</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:31.190" style="s2">Praja that it&#39;s it&#39;s an enacted dynamic</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.900" end="00:06:46.860" style="s2">stand out to us and as we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:48.870" style="s2">about that repeatedly this framing is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.860" end="00:06:50.849" style="s2">often completely transparent to us we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.870" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">doing it automatically mindlessly</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.849" end="00:06:56.069" style="s2">reactively but what we can do with with</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">the pasa is we can learn to step back</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.069" end="00:07:01.439" style="s2">and look at that framing become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:04.379" style="s2">the patterns and processes of our mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.439" end="00:07:07.620" style="s2">and notice anything that might be a</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.620" end="00:07:11.789" style="s2">about it bring more acuity to it all</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">that stuff we&#39;ve been practicing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.789" end="00:07:20.250" style="s2">then how do I know if I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:22.409" style="s2">corrected the distortion well then I I</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.250" end="00:07:25.050" style="s2">have to put my glasses back on</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.409" end="00:07:28.139" style="s2">and like in Metta I have to look deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.050" end="00:07:32.009" style="s2">into the world and see if I can see the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.139" end="00:07:34.289" style="s2">world anew if I can unlock right my</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.009" end="00:07:37.080" style="s2">identities and the identities of things</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.289" end="00:07:39.419" style="s2">if I can turn my existential mode into</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.080" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">the being mode in which I in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.419" end="00:07:42.689" style="s2">are being reciprocally opened like you</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:45.990" style="s2">do when you&#39;re falling in love with</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.689" end="00:07:48.629" style="s2">somebody this is a kind of love of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.990" end="00:07:50.490" style="s2">course this is not sexual erotic love</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.629" end="00:07:52.370" style="s2">this is the kind of love that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.490" end="00:07:55.379" style="s2">captured by ruler words like Karuna</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.370" end="00:07:57.150" style="s2">compassion right the word compassion is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.379" end="00:07:59.250" style="s2">a little bit problematic we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.150" end="00:08:04.349" style="s2">to that a little bit later when we move</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.250" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">on to some further lessons so this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.349" end="00:08:10.919" style="s2">what you do in an insight insight has</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:14.099" style="s2">sort of three components to it there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.919" end="00:08:16.169" style="s2">a movement that breaks an inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.099" end="00:08:18.930" style="s2">frame and then there&#39;s a movement that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.169" end="00:08:21.659" style="s2">makes a more encompassing more</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.930" end="00:08:23.669" style="s2">well-fitted more right-handed more</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.659" end="00:08:27.000" style="s2">dexterous more octave leak gripping</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.669" end="00:08:29.699" style="s2">frame and so when you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.000" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">studying insight as a phenomena you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.699" end="00:08:34.680" style="s2">when you have an aha moment and I do</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:36.120" style="s2">that scientifically at U of T it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.680" end="00:08:37.199" style="s2">up of these sort of three - what are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.120" end="00:08:39.659" style="s2">three components there&#39;s a breaking</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.199" end="00:08:42.060" style="s2">frame and the making frame and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.659" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">there&#39;s the flexibility to move between</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.060" end="00:08:51.020" style="s2">them so breaking frame making frame and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:54.709" style="s2">how flexible are you in being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.020" end="00:08:54.709" style="s2">that transfer me</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.430" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">so what does that mean in practice what</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.300" end="00:09:03.959" style="s2">leans in practice that we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:07.290" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to get those two</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.959" end="00:09:10.110" style="s2">motions at work in a coordinated fashion</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.290" end="00:09:12.750" style="s2">and that is training the flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.110" end="00:09:15.450" style="s2">between them by having us constantly</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.750" end="00:09:17.010" style="s2">flip and reverse between them that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.450" end="00:09:19.380" style="s2">you do flexibility you constantly</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.010" end="00:09:22.230" style="s2">reverse your direction right you try to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.380" end="00:09:24.269" style="s2">extend the range and the fluency and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.230" end="00:09:28.079" style="s2">speed of your ability to reverse</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.269" end="00:09:31.320" style="s2">direction okay so this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.079" end="00:09:33.180" style="s2">going to do now okay I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.320" end="00:09:35.820" style="s2">describe this practice to you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.180" end="00:09:38.010" style="s2">start doing it right now and I also want</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.820" end="00:09:40.500" style="s2">to give you some things to look for and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.010" end="00:09:42.510" style="s2">both positively like things that help</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.500" end="00:09:45.029" style="s2">you sort of understand what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.510" end="00:09:52.170" style="s2">and then also negatively things to watch</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.029" end="00:09:53.459" style="s2">out for to avoid now for about 80% of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.170" end="00:09:55.079" style="s2">the people I&#39;ve been teaching this for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.459" end="00:09:58.140" style="s2">long time the way I&#39;m going to describe</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.079" end="00:10:00.390" style="s2">it works for them about 20% of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.140" end="00:10:02.490" style="s2">people it&#39;s reversed they have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.390" end="00:10:03.959" style="s2">the opposite way and so you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.490" end="00:10:05.610" style="s2">have to also experiment with this a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.959" end="00:10:08.070" style="s2">couple sets to see which one takes treat</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.610" end="00:10:09.980" style="s2">so for the statistically normal group</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.070" end="00:10:14.459" style="s2">this is what it&#39;s like as you inhale and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.980" end="00:10:17.940" style="s2">you feel your abdomen expanding you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.459" end="00:10:21.690" style="s2">that extension of awareness outward in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.940" end="00:10:24.209" style="s2">Metta when you try and take Metta as</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.690" end="00:10:25.470" style="s2">sort of broadly to maybe you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.209" end="00:10:28.589" style="s2">doing it towards all people not maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.470" end="00:10:31.110" style="s2">towards all being and right in a nut and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.589" end="00:10:32.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like flow not just broadly but</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.110" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">deeply you try to extend it towards all</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.910" end="00:10:37.740" style="s2">beings and really unlock the potential</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:39.959" style="s2">of the world to be other than use</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.740" end="00:10:43.890" style="s2">currently see it as it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.959" end="00:10:46.649" style="s2">insight and then as you exhale you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.890" end="00:10:48.630" style="s2">the past nut and you do that but Pastner</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.649" end="00:10:51.810" style="s2">that I taught you where you try and go</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.630" end="00:10:54.290" style="s2">to the very center right that space</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.810" end="00:10:56.430" style="s2">between your thoughts the silent morning</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.290" end="00:10:58.860" style="s2">so you move towards sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.430" end="00:11:01.260" style="s2">mysterious ground of the psyche in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.860" end="00:11:04.770" style="s2">pasta and opening up to the mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.260" end="00:11:06.030" style="s2">round of the world in meta and then what</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.770" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.030" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">is flowing between them you&#39;re flowing</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:15.510" style="s2">between them so like so for 80% of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:19.110" style="s2">people as you inhale Mehta out as you</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.510" end="00:11:25.740" style="s2">exhale the pasta end to a space between</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.110" end="00:11:29.900" style="s2">your thoughts now the flexibility will</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.740" end="00:11:32.790" style="s2">be lacking right so what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.900" end="00:11:36.380" style="s2">well you&#39;ll you&#39;ll say in half a breath</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.790" end="00:11:37.890" style="s2">I won&#39;t get much better that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.380" end="00:11:40.500" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.890" end="00:11:42.690" style="s2">and in half of a breath I won&#39;t will I</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.500" end="00:11:43.650" style="s2">be able to get most of that know you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.690" end="00:11:48.300" style="s2">better than to just going to move</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.650" end="00:11:50.220" style="s2">towards it flexibility means and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.300" end="00:11:52.290" style="s2">what will take a lot of time just to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.220" end="00:11:56.340" style="s2">the flexibility is that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.290" end="00:12:00.060" style="s2">inhale you&#39;re able to realize deep Mehta</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.340" end="00:12:05.460" style="s2">and in the exhale you&#39;re able to realize</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.060" end="00:12:09.900" style="s2">deep focus now this takes time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.460" end="00:12:12.660" style="s2">not initially flexible so you will only</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.900" end="00:12:15.930" style="s2">get a shallow sense of meta and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.660" end="00:12:20.310" style="s2">shallow sense of a Pastner that is fine</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.930" end="00:12:26.940" style="s2">that will take time it&#39;s fine that will</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.310" end="00:12:29.130" style="s2">take time now in connection with that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.940" end="00:12:31.470" style="s2">here&#39;s something to avoid in order to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.130" end="00:12:33.750" style="s2">extend the time so so that they have</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.470" end="00:12:35.880" style="s2">more time to try to get deeper into meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.750" end="00:12:41.490" style="s2">and deeper and the pasta people start to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.880" end="00:12:44.910" style="s2">hyperventilate exaggerating so you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.490" end="00:12:47.460" style="s2">what I mean it&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.910" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">this practice is the one that is most</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.460" end="00:12:53.940" style="s2">susceptible to hyperventilation and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:58.680" style="s2">would make you lightheaded it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.940" end="00:13:01.350" style="s2">for you so you have to be vigilant that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.680" end="00:13:03.810" style="s2">you are not hyperventilating you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.350" end="00:13:06.630" style="s2">leave your breathing alone and let it</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.810" end="00:13:08.100" style="s2">flow naturally you want this you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.630" end="00:13:10.290" style="s2">Prussia to be something that flows</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.100" end="00:13:12.780" style="s2">naturally in you not something that only</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.290" end="00:13:17.389" style="s2">is arrived at when you force things to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.780" end="00:13:19.730" style="s2">an extremity okay so</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.389" end="00:13:21.259" style="s2">really andar really accepting that this</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.730" end="00:13:23.689" style="s2">was going to initially be I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.259" end="00:13:26.829" style="s2">the flexibility so initially shallow</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.689" end="00:13:30.259" style="s2">meta shallow of a Pastner just whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.829" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">taste I can get of both and now I</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.259" end="00:13:35.989" style="s2">hyperventilate not hyperventilate</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.980" style="s2">you&#39;ll do this for a long time for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.989" end="00:13:40.100" style="s2">long time all you&#39;re going to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.980" end="00:13:43.459" style="s2">is developing the flexibility now notice</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.100" end="00:13:46.369" style="s2">that Praja is only as good as you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.459" end="00:13:47.689" style="s2">practicing meta and deep the pasta and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.369" end="00:13:49.189" style="s2">trying to extend that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.689" end="00:13:52.189" style="s2">farther by the way like if you&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.189" end="00:13:53.989" style="s2">been going up to like people maybe all</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.189" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">sentient beings and then after a while</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.989" end="00:14:04.519" style="s2">more beings okay so it&#39;s very crucial</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:06.649" style="s2">that what you just the the progress that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.519" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for initially is just</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.649" end="00:14:13.009" style="s2">that in a natural unforced breath I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:14.929" style="s2">move into deep meta so you I have to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.009" end="00:14:16.579" style="s2">practicing meta a lot and I have to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.929" end="00:14:19.639" style="s2">doing this a lot before it that will</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.579" end="00:14:23.149" style="s2">occur and then in the out-breath I get</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.639" end="00:14:25.459" style="s2">into deep for pasta right so I have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.149" end="00:14:28.009" style="s2">be practicing the pasta a lot deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.459" end="00:14:30.669" style="s2">Vipassana and practicing this progeny</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.009" end="00:14:33.699" style="s2">practice a lot before that will happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.669" end="00:14:37.269" style="s2">so that&#39;s going to take a long time</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.699" end="00:14:39.529" style="s2">once they there they both are deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.269" end="00:14:41.449" style="s2">alright then you&#39;ll just be there for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.529" end="00:14:46.699" style="s2">while just getting the flexibility to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.449" end="00:14:49.399" style="s2">become very second nature that flow then</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.699" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">what starts to happen is you start to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.399" end="00:14:55.149" style="s2">get a foreground background so well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:57.709" style="s2">sensing meta I have sort of a background</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.149" end="00:15:00.049" style="s2">awareness of the depth of a past know</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.709" end="00:15:05.019" style="s2">that I was touching and then it goes</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.049" end="00:15:08.299" style="s2">like this it starts to go like this and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.019" end="00:15:11.720" style="s2">then I start to be able to feel them</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.299" end="00:15:19.489" style="s2">both active in my breath this takes a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.720" end="00:15:22.519" style="s2">long time and then it&#39;s all at once</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.489" end="00:15:25.819" style="s2">simultaneously as deeply out and is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.519" end="00:15:28.459" style="s2">deeply in mystery to mystery ground to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.819" end="00:15:31.290" style="s2">ground the deepest possible reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.459" end="00:15:34.960" style="s2">opening the deepest residence</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.290" end="00:15:37.510" style="s2">you&#39;re in the state right of non-duality</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.960" end="00:15:40.210" style="s2">your awareness is not subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.510" end="00:15:44.050" style="s2">oriented or objectively oriented it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.210" end="00:15:47.650" style="s2">transient it this is the place that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.050" end="00:15:51.160" style="s2">optimal for optimizing your optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.650" end="00:15:53.080" style="s2">for affording deep deep insight not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.160" end="00:15:55.930" style="s2">intellectual insight but insight at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.080" end="00:15:58.620" style="s2">very level of the identity of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.930" end="00:16:01.980" style="s2">and the world this is a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.620" end="00:16:04.770" style="s2">liberating form of intelligence inside</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.980" end="00:16:07.660" style="s2">Praja</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.770" end="00:16:11.500" style="s2">this will not be something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.660" end="00:16:15.400" style="s2">to you tomorrow next week next month</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.500" end="00:16:17.560" style="s2">maybe not even this year okay this takes</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.400" end="00:16:19.750" style="s2">a long time before it comes in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.560" end="00:16:22.060" style="s2">what I mean when I said this practice is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.750" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">liminal you can start it with with an</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.060" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">introductory set of skills if you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:31.000" style="s2">to start somewhere but you will go</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">through these stages for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.000" end="00:16:35.860" style="s2">time all you will be doing is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:37.000" style="s2">developing the flexibility then you will</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.860" end="00:16:39.100" style="s2">start to develop some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.000" end="00:16:45.730" style="s2">simultaneity and then you will get the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.100" end="00:16:49.510" style="s2">gestalt of possible and then more and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.730" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">more as you practice that it will be</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.510" end="00:17:02.920" style="s2">there available to you and it will start</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:17:06.459" style="s2">to present itself to you so now you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.920" end="00:17:10.569" style="s2">should think of yourself having this</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.459" end="00:17:13.480" style="s2">kind of practice always one day do basic</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.569" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">start with basics of house nut basic</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.480" end="00:17:21.939" style="s2">bypass not and then lead into deeper</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:25.900" style="s2">past my next day do meta trying always</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.939" end="00:17:31.960" style="s2">and gradually to be extending meta third</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.900" end="00:17:32.530" style="s2">day Praja do that twice see good three</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.960" end="00:17:36.910" style="s2">and three</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.530" end="00:17:38.350" style="s2">okay but that&#39;s not basic into deep meta</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.910" end="00:17:40.750" style="s2">deepening it Praja</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.350" end="00:17:44.410" style="s2">and then again the past of a second too</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.750" end="00:17:46.900" style="s2">deep meta deepening it and Praja</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.410" end="00:17:49.000" style="s2">the seventh day do one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.900" end="00:17:52.180" style="s2">things like perhaps meditative questing</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.000" end="00:17:58.420" style="s2">in order to refine and enhance inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.180" end="00:18:04.270" style="s2">mindfulness okay so that&#39;s the practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.420" end="00:18:06.940" style="s2">don&#39;t rush into it I recommend doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.270" end="00:18:11.650" style="s2">some you know basically passing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.940" end="00:18:14.350" style="s2">first reminding yourself satyed enacted</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.650" end="00:18:16.390" style="s2">remembering oh yeah this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.350" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">pastor feels like then a bit of meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.390" end="00:18:20.980" style="s2">perhaps your most extensive meta that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:23.410" style="s2">you have been practicing regularly and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.980" end="00:18:25.240" style="s2">push it up remember not just as wide as</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.410" end="00:18:27.100" style="s2">possible but as deep you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.240" end="00:18:28.540" style="s2">really do as much reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.100" end="00:18:33.900" style="s2">remembering the being mode as much as</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.540" end="00:18:37.270" style="s2">you can just a metaphor a while and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.900" end="00:18:44.020" style="s2">come back to the pasta and do the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.270" end="00:18:49.180" style="s2">pasta space between your thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.020" end="00:18:51.700" style="s2">then in breath deep meta out breath</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.180" end="00:18:54.310" style="s2">deeper pasta accepting that it will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.700" end="00:18:56.830" style="s2">shallow not as deep as when I can sit on</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.310" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">within eat four with each for a long</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.830" end="00:19:02.770" style="s2">time and not hyperventilating so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:04.210" style="s2">sit for about 15 minutes maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.770" end="00:19:06.600" style="s2">after you&#39;ve done your Center and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.210" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">routine you know to two or three minutes</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.600" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna time you through it just to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:16.560" style="s2">it intuitively right a few minutes you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:19.960" style="s2">know basic you know basic in the pasta</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.560" end="00:19:24.760" style="s2">then deep meta returning to deep for</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.960" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">pasta and then go into Praja don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.760" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">hyperventilate don&#39;t hyperventilate</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:32.890" style="s2">don&#39;t hyperventilate understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:34.780" style="s2">meta and a half breath and of a past and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.890" end="00:19:37.540" style="s2">a half breath rather be much shallower</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.780" end="00:19:39.790" style="s2">than when you can follow them completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.540" end="00:19:42.820" style="s2">with a whole breath for a complete 15</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.790" end="00:19:49.170" style="s2">minutes it takes a long time to develop</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.820" end="00:19:49.170" style="s2">the flexibility okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.649" end="00:19:57.619" style="s2">so take your time be patient</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.159" end="00:20:00.259" style="s2">make sure your phones are set on - do</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.619" end="00:20:07.239" style="s2">not disturb it&#39;s your posture ready and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.259" end="00:20:07.239" style="s2">we will begin when I say together begin</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.770" end="00:35:17.650" style="s2">Shh slowly come out of you practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.150" end="00:35:19.390" style="s2">trying as best you can get integrate</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.650" end="00:35:21.400" style="s2">what he cultivated in your practice with</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.390" end="00:35:23.860" style="s2">your Bhatia consciousness and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.400" end="00:35:25.950" style="s2">perhaps by reciting the five promises to</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.860" end="00:35:25.950" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.710" end="00:36:40.330" style="s2">all right everyone so we went a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.840" end="00:36:44.620" style="s2">bit long today there don&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.330" end="00:36:51.190" style="s2">any questions though um are there any</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.620" end="00:36:53.910" style="s2">questions that need to be addressed okay</p>
