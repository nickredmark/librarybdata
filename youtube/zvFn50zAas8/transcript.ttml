<p begin="00:00:04.500" end="00:00:09.090" style="s2">just did it and then there was no sound</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.750" end="00:00:10.679" style="s2">so now I&#39;m redoing it and I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.090" end="00:00:12.150" style="s2">cut out the first little bit hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:13.320" style="s2">the sound just works and if not</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.150" end="00:00:14.969" style="s2">fast-forward a little bit because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.320" end="00:00:16.020" style="s2">the sound gets better when I cut it out</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:17.640" style="s2">that might have been what made the sound</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.020" end="00:00:20.580" style="s2">not work my tech skills aren&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.640" end="00:00:22.170" style="s2">enough to get it back so I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.580" end="00:00:24.180" style="s2">today about what happens under</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.170" end="00:00:24.630" style="s2">capitalism and communism and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.180" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">co-operative</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.630" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">when to decide how much of something</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">gets made what price to set it at and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2">what quality level to make it up so</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:37.040" style="s2">under communism theoretically there is</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.260" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">no price the price is set at cost and</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.040" end="00:00:42.899" style="s2">how much they create is how much is had</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">the central planning department thinks</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.899" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">is needed and they create it at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">lowest probably adequate quality so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">they can make enough for everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">make it and make it very simple so</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:00:58.280" style="s2">everyone gets the same thing everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">gets the same at the adequate quality</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.280" end="00:01:03.570" style="s2">under because they&#39;re just asking how</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:07.100" style="s2">much do we need the question asked under</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.570" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">supply and demands by the producer is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.100" end="00:01:11.610" style="s2">what price will maximize my profit what</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:13.229" style="s2">price should I set it at because if I</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.610" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">set it too high people aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.229" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">buy it I&#39;m not going to make enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:17.640" style="s2">profit and if I set it too low I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">have enough of a profit margin to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.640" end="00:01:23.250" style="s2">able to make enough profit so with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">in mind they also have to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.250" end="00:01:27.259" style="s2">much of something to make and guess how</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">much their customers are going to want</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.259" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to make too few of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">because then they&#39;re gonna miss out on</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">sales that they would have gotten and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:34.770" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to make too many of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">because they don&#39;t want them sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.770" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">shelves taking up space having resources</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">both time and actual tangible resources</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">in them that they&#39;re never going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">able to recoup if they never able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">sell them and then the customer the user</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:52.110" style="s2">gets to decide will I buy it at this</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">price point so there&#39;s is more of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">yes-or-no answer like it&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:01:59.909" style="s2">dollars yeah okay I&#39;ll just spend that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:02:03.380" style="s2">they don&#39;t get to have a say besides yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.909" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">yes or no under the co-operative model</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.380" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">we are not having this friction between</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">the producer and the user because we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:13.709" style="s2">the producer and the user and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:16.469" style="s2">instead asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.709" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">how many of these do we need to make to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.469" end="00:02:22.469" style="s2">bring the price down low and have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:24.090" style="s2">quality be the highest so what that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.469" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">means is we&#39;re asking directly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:29.909" style="s2">person who&#39;s who&#39;s making the decision</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:31.019" style="s2">the individual if it&#39;s at this price</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.909" end="00:02:32.670" style="s2">point how much are you buying at this</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.019" end="00:02:34.230" style="s2">price point as we get lower and lower</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.670" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">people want to buy more and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.230" end="00:02:37.079" style="s2">accessory if it&#39;s set out that way</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:38.430" style="s2">sometimes people like buying the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.079" end="00:02:40.889" style="s2">high-end ticket item because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.430" end="00:02:44.579" style="s2">prestige this isn&#39;t that because this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.889" end="00:02:46.349" style="s2">we&#39;re making jars of pasta how many do</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.579" end="00:02:49.409" style="s2">you want if it&#39;s five dollars how many</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.349" end="00:02:52.290" style="s2">do you want if it&#39;s two dollars and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.409" end="00:02:56.159" style="s2">we&#39;re making the quantity that brings</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.290" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">the most happiness so if we we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.159" end="00:03:01.530" style="s2">enough people willing to if we can get</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">it down to two dollars and we have we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.530" end="00:03:04.260" style="s2">need 10 million people signed up then</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:08.069" style="s2">then we need to get it down to 10</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.260" end="00:03:09.389" style="s2">million and then so the individual is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.069" end="00:03:10.769" style="s2">going to be answering the question how</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.389" end="00:03:13.319" style="s2">much am I going to buy at the price</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.769" end="00:03:15.150" style="s2">point and what quality for that so if if</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.319" end="00:03:16.950" style="s2">I would pay five dollars so it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.150" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">organic but only three dollars if it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.950" end="00:03:20.430" style="s2">conventional I&#39;m putting that into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.930" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">system and then the system is saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.430" end="00:03:24.030" style="s2">okay well we have ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.099" style="s2">that are interested but we can&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.030" end="00:03:27.389" style="s2">this low because we don&#39;t have a million</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.099" end="00:03:28.709" style="s2">people interested so therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.389" end="00:03:30.359" style="s2">lowest price point we can set it out</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:33.209" style="s2">making it at ten thousand to break-even</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.359" end="00:03:34.439" style="s2">is four dollars and all the we know</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.209" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">people have committed they&#39;ve committed</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.439" end="00:03:37.739" style="s2">to the four dollars so we can make it at</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">that price and then we make it at that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.739" end="00:03:40.620" style="s2">price and people have committed then</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:43.769" style="s2">they&#39;re committed to buying and there</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.620" end="00:03:45.959" style="s2">can be a rating system to know did this</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.769" end="00:03:48.359" style="s2">person continually go through right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:49.979" style="s2">when you sign up for a Kickstarter we</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.359" end="00:03:53.370" style="s2">care that the person you&#39;re giving money</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.979" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">to is going to be giving them the money</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.370" end="00:03:57.959" style="s2">and then they&#39;re making the product here</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:03:59.069" style="s2">we&#39;re saying we&#39;re asking would you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.959" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">commit to this you&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.069" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">putting the money in until the product</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">is ready to be made until we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:07.109" style="s2">made the price point decision and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:10.949" style="s2">you&#39;re committed to putting that money</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.109" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">in in advance before it gets made so if</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.949" end="00:04:14.669" style="s2">you don&#39;t then put the money in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:17.340" style="s2">going to be a mark against you in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.669" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">future if you&#39;re with compassion though</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.340" end="00:04:20.789" style="s2">because if you committed to something</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:22.200" style="s2">for ten thousand dollars and now your</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.789" end="00:04:24.180" style="s2">finances to completely change because</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.200" end="00:04:25.469" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost your job or got cancer we</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.180" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2">need a way for that to be evidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.469" end="00:04:29.370" style="s2">versus I changed</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:32.100" style="s2">reminds because nature mind affects</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.370" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">everyone else whereas we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.100" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">compassion that life circumstances do</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:38.849" style="s2">change so whole point is to make a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:42.060" style="s2">efficient system and a more more</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.849" end="00:04:44.130" style="s2">happiness for everyone and under I do</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.060" end="00:04:47.039" style="s2">think in this regard capitalism does</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.130" end="00:04:49.410" style="s2">better than communism but we can do way</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.039" end="00:04:50.940" style="s2">better because we can take away the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.410" end="00:04:52.919" style="s2">friction that comes between producer and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.940" end="00:04:55.590" style="s2">user and instead be both of those at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.919" end="00:04:56.849" style="s2">same time and decide what quality are we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.590" end="00:04:58.440" style="s2">comfortable at do we wanted to have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.849" end="00:04:58.620" style="s2">long shelf life and put preservatives in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.440" end="00:05:00.630" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.620" end="00:05:02.370" style="s2">or do we want it to be something you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.630" end="00:05:05.669" style="s2">have to consume within a week and make</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.370" end="00:05:07.560" style="s2">it every week and we&#39;re asking people</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.669" end="00:05:08.669" style="s2">what their actual values are and having</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.560" end="00:05:10.380" style="s2">them commit to it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.669" end="00:05:11.580" style="s2">now committed to buying that pasta sauce</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.380" end="00:05:12.900" style="s2">for the rest of your life it means</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:15.300" style="s2">you&#39;re committed to buying that jar of</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">can feed back in the system cuz I&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:23.240" style="s2">ridiculous thing to do every time you</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:26.819" style="s2">need to buy pasta you can we can see</p>
