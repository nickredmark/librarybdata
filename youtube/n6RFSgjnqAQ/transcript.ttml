<p begin="00:00:04.970" end="00:00:10.380" style="s2">John real pleasure to speak to you from</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:11.910" style="s2">Toronto to London thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.380" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">for anyone who doesn&#39;t know you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.910" end="00:00:16.350" style="s2">putting out a series called awakening</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">from the meaning crisis for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.350" end="00:00:21.779" style="s2">probably the most excited I&#39;ve felt it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">a kind of intellectual journey since I</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.779" end="00:00:28.050" style="s2">discovered Jordan Peterson I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">year and a half ago and what&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.050" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">amazing about it is that you guys work</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:33.090" style="s2">in the same department yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2">we&#39;re colleagues at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.090" end="00:00:36.510" style="s2">Toronto yeah so what are they put what</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:40.980" style="s2">are they putting in the water at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.510" end="00:00:42.600" style="s2">University of Toronto I&#39;m not sure we</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">just have a lot of really good people in</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.600" end="00:00:46.739" style="s2">that department and there are some</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">similarities between your work and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.739" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">here&#39;s you both talk about meaning a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">you both talk about you&#39;re not afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">kind of go into the mythological into</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">the religious what would you say are the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:01.739" style="s2">similarities and the differences between</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">your work and his okay so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.739" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">important similarities I think you put</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:08.369" style="s2">your finger on it very well I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">we&#39;re both concerned with the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.369" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">meaning and the meaning crisis I would I</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:15.450" style="s2">would claim in fact that I think a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">significant proportion of Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.450" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">popularity is that he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">the meaning crisis because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">exigent right now and perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">urgent and we are interested in the role</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">of myth and ritual Jordan is also I</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">believe interested in altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:39.420" style="s2">consciousness so those are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">significant similarities I would say and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.420" end="00:01:43.939" style="s2">so we&#39;ve we&#39;ve shared a lot of students</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">over the past years because of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.939" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">we&#39;ve spoken at multiple conferences</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">together because of these shared</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">interests Jordan also has an interest</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">because I had a public debate with him</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">if quite a while ago on what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">the frame problem which relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">work I do on relevance realization so</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a shared interest there some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">the main differences so Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:10.280" style="s2">framework is very largely from</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:13.390" style="s2">psychology personality theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.280" end="00:02:17.240" style="s2">and from psychodynamic background Union</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.390" end="00:02:18.830" style="s2">so I I know young and I&#39;ve gone I went</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.240" end="00:02:21.010" style="s2">through Union therapy to get an inside</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.830" end="00:02:24.020" style="s2">understanding of it I&#39;ve taken workshops</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.010" end="00:02:25.220" style="s2">and I do some relevant work around this</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.020" end="00:02:28.880" style="s2">so I have some understanding of it I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.220" end="00:02:30.709" style="s2">don&#39;t have as expertise but that that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.880" end="00:02:33.290" style="s2">not the primary framework within at</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.709" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">which I work there framework with within</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.290" end="00:02:37.610" style="s2">in which I work is very much a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:39.050" style="s2">science framework so for your listeners</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.610" end="00:02:41.870" style="s2">who aren&#39;t familiar with it cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.050" end="00:02:44.750" style="s2">science is an interdisciplinary science</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.870" end="00:02:47.180" style="s2">it&#39;s designed to get the various</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.750" end="00:02:49.250" style="s2">discourses that talk about the mind at</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.180" end="00:02:50.420" style="s2">various levels like neuroscience the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.250" end="00:02:52.600" style="s2">brain machine learning information</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.420" end="00:02:54.980" style="s2">processing psychology behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.600" end="00:02:56.810" style="s2">linguistics language to get them all to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.980" end="00:02:58.489" style="s2">talk to each other because they all use</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.810" end="00:03:00.590" style="s2">very different terminology different</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.489" end="00:03:02.450" style="s2">methods different different types of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.590" end="00:03:04.819" style="s2">evidence so getting them all to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.450" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">each other so we can get a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.819" end="00:03:08.420" style="s2">understanding of how these various</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:10.850" style="s2">different levels of the mind causally</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.420" end="00:03:13.819" style="s2">interact and constrain each other and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.850" end="00:03:15.560" style="s2">also we can get a more coherent and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.819" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">clearer picture of mine rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.560" end="00:03:20.180" style="s2">having this disparate disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:22.549" style="s2">discourses about the mind so I do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.180" end="00:03:25.640" style="s2">of work in cognitive science and I bring</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.549" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">that framework to bear and then in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.640" end="00:03:29.810" style="s2">connection with that I have I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">multiple degrees in philosophy so I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.810" end="00:03:33.670" style="s2">bring in a philosophical framework</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:36.500" style="s2">especially through the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.670" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">tradition in the West and the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.500" end="00:03:43.070" style="s2">tradition in the East I also I practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.470" style="s2">there&#39;s Buddhist practices I engage in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.070" end="00:03:48.350" style="s2">and I teach the past non-meta and I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.470" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">do Tai Chi Chuan and Qigong so I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.350" end="00:03:53.650" style="s2">have familiarity with Taoism so I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:58.310" style="s2">that as sort of a different background</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.650" end="00:04:00.829" style="s2">than Jordan I also I have a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.310" end="00:04:03.260" style="s2">take on certain aspects so areas where I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.829" end="00:04:08.780" style="s2">think I would be in disagreement with</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.260" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2">Jordan is Jordan tends to pitch this as</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.780" end="00:04:14.120" style="s2">a political issue as a confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">from ideologies I have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.120" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">principled arguments against seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:20.390" style="s2">that way and trying to frame the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:23.000" style="s2">crisis that way so that&#39;s one area where</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.390" end="00:04:23.790" style="s2">I probably would significantly disagree</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.000" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">with him on</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.790" end="00:04:27.900" style="s2">to try to respond to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:30.270" style="s2">that&#39;s really lots of really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.900" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">things to pick up on there already and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.270" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">mean this is something that we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:36.930" style="s2">do with rebel wisdom is to bring more of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:38.760" style="s2">a kind of what is the meta crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.930" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">is generating the political crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.760" end="00:04:43.230" style="s2">rather than what is the political crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.460" end="00:04:45.930" style="s2">per se because then you just get dragged</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.230" end="00:04:48.150" style="s2">into these very polarized debates very</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.930" end="00:04:50.850" style="s2">quickly I just want to sort of back up a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.150" end="00:04:53.370" style="s2">little bit and just ask you what is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.850" end="00:04:55.640" style="s2">meaning crisis the symptoms are things</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.370" end="00:04:58.410" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about we&#39;ve got you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.640" end="00:05:01.590" style="s2">incredible political adversarial and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.410" end="00:05:04.110" style="s2">degenerative discourse we have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.590" end="00:05:07.740" style="s2">pervasive sense we talked about this</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.740" end="00:05:12.930" style="s2">actually measured it right of a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.930" end="00:05:15.990" style="s2">know I use that term technically and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.760" end="00:05:17.880" style="s2">might want to talk about that at some</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.990" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">point following on Frankfurt&#39;s seminal</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.880" end="00:05:23.370" style="s2">work on but the the the</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.110" end="00:06:16.920" style="s2">and I think others would agree with this</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.170" end="00:06:35.580" style="s2">date it so that&#39;s that&#39;s a tricky</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.820" end="00:06:37.020" style="s2">question I think that so I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.580" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">these three orders</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.020" end="00:06:43.560" style="s2">that helped to organize the various ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:45.210" style="s2">in which so when you study meeting in</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.560" end="00:06:47.490" style="s2">life people are sort of there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.210" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">trying to they need a framework to help</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.490" end="00:06:50.220" style="s2">them make sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:51.690" style="s2">they need a framework to help them</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.220" end="00:06:54.030" style="s2">connect to reality and connect to other</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.690" end="00:06:56.060" style="s2">people and they need a framework that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.030" end="00:06:59.069" style="s2">gives them a sense of how to improve</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.060" end="00:07:01.110" style="s2">normatively self transcendence in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.069" end="00:07:03.240" style="s2">fashion and of course we had a framework</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.110" end="00:07:05.669" style="s2">with that it was it was a it was a grand</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.240" end="00:07:08.849" style="s2">synthesis right a sort of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.669" end="00:07:12.330" style="s2">and Neoplatonism and that framework has</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.849" end="00:07:15.990" style="s2">collapsed and right in the face of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.330" end="00:07:17.940" style="s2">very powerful and I would also very</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.990" end="00:07:21.630" style="s2">important I am a scientist the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.940" end="00:07:23.729" style="s2">scientific framework and so I think when</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.630" end="00:07:25.560" style="s2">we can start the dating of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.729" end="00:07:26.940" style="s2">crisis and in both the 12th century</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.560" end="00:07:28.819" style="s2">believe it or not because that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.940" end="00:07:30.719" style="s2">you see that framework start unraveling</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.819" end="00:07:34.409" style="s2">start to unravel and then that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.719" end="00:07:35.940" style="s2">unraveling accelerates through time the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.409" end="00:07:38.310" style="s2">Scientific Revolution the Protestant</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.940" end="00:07:40.469" style="s2">Reformation have a huge accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.310" end="00:07:41.940" style="s2">affects the Industrial Revolution as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.469" end="00:07:43.770" style="s2">huge accelerating effect and now of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.940" end="00:07:45.659" style="s2">course the computer revolution right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.770" end="00:07:48.270" style="s2">the AI revolution are having</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.659" end="00:07:51.150" style="s2">accelerating effects social media so it</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.270" end="00:07:52.919" style="s2">starts I would say like in the 12th</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.150" end="00:07:54.719" style="s2">century but it&#39;s accelerating it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.919" end="00:07:58.500" style="s2">massively accelerating I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.719" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">especially in the last 20 years and just</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.500" end="00:08:02.520" style="s2">sort of going back to Jordan Peterson a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:05.009" style="s2">little bit I think we spoke before we</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.520" end="00:08:07.259" style="s2">had a we had a zoo McCall a few days ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.009" end="00:08:09.180" style="s2">and you you kind of joked that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.259" end="00:08:14.789" style="s2">Peterson was a gateway drug to your</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.180" end="00:08:17.130" style="s2">thinking yeah I I want it clear that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.789" end="00:08:19.349" style="s2">know Jordan has been very supportive of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.130" end="00:08:24.300" style="s2">my work and so I don&#39;t want to in any</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.349" end="00:08:27.270" style="s2">way come off as dismissive of him Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.300" end="00:08:29.969" style="s2">is a very complex guy very complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.270" end="00:08:32.370" style="s2">thinker but what is typically happened</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.969" end="00:08:36.089" style="s2">at least in my anecdotal experiences</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.370" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">people get interested in Jordan&#39;s work I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.089" end="00:08:39.089" style="s2">have to be careful here there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:41.339" style="s2">selection bias I&#39;m only getting a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.089" end="00:08:43.500" style="s2">certain a certain set but typically</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.339" end="00:08:44.970" style="s2">people have come out of you know a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.500" end="00:08:46.829" style="s2">religious framework or an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.970" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">framework they&#39;ve gotten introduced to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.829" end="00:08:51.269" style="s2">Jordans discussions about spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.970" style="s2">religion and mythology and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.269" end="00:08:56.819" style="s2">unconscious and then they come because</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.970" end="00:08:58.290" style="s2">they typically want something as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.819" end="00:09:01.129" style="s2">mentioned earlier beyond the Union</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.290" end="00:09:04.319" style="s2">framework they want a way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.129" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">incorporating that in two senses that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.319" end="00:09:09.660" style="s2">don&#39;t think Jordan talks about that I I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:12.029" style="s2">can namely that whole cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.660" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">scientific framework how do we bring our</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.029" end="00:09:15.629" style="s2">best cutting-edge cognitive science to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">bear on these issues so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.629" end="00:09:18.689" style="s2">integrate this understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.920" end="00:09:20.310" style="s2">spirituality with the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.689" end="00:09:23.100" style="s2">framework that&#39;s extremely important to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.310" end="00:09:24.540" style="s2">me by the way this integration like like</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.100" end="00:09:26.009" style="s2">I talked about how cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.540" end="00:09:27.509" style="s2">integrates across the disciplines it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.009" end="00:09:29.610" style="s2">very important to me that I integrate</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.509" end="00:09:31.800" style="s2">right I respect the differences but yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.610" end="00:09:33.959" style="s2">build a bridging vocabulary between what</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.800" end="00:09:36.300" style="s2">for lack of a better term spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.959" end="00:09:38.459" style="s2">and the scientific worldview and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.300" end="00:09:41.730" style="s2">that&#39;s one reason why they come to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.459" end="00:09:43.649" style="s2">the other reason is I mean I I teach you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.730" end="00:09:45.930" style="s2">know the passion of meditation meta Tai</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.649" end="00:09:47.910" style="s2">Chi Chuan I teach you know I&#39;ve taught</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.930" end="00:09:50.939" style="s2">within when I had a wisdom Sangha</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.910" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">various you know stoic practices and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.939" end="00:09:54.899" style="s2">cyclic technology so people also come to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.279" end="00:09:57.870" style="s2">get you know well what do I actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.899" end="00:10:00.509" style="s2">train how do I practice transforming</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.870" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">consciousness cognition character so</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.509" end="00:10:04.170" style="s2">that&#39;s how that&#39;s how that happens so</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:05.579" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard you talk about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.170" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">science quite a lot and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.579" end="00:10:10.290" style="s2">familiar with the term before and I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:13.740" style="s2">to say it sounds like quite a boring</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.290" end="00:10:15.509" style="s2">term for something that when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.740" end="00:10:19.560" style="s2">about it sounds absolutely fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.509" end="00:10:21.959" style="s2">and and what I understand by it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.560" end="00:10:25.290" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong is that it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.959" end="00:10:28.290" style="s2">much of your work is about how we do</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.290" end="00:10:30.269" style="s2">things so it&#39;s just how we how we think</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.290" end="00:10:32.519" style="s2">rather than what we think and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.269" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">content of what we think and actually it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.519" end="00:10:36.689" style="s2">turns out that how we think is at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.209" style="s2">it important if not more important than</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.689" end="00:10:41.399" style="s2">what we&#39;re thinking that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.209" end="00:10:43.980" style="s2">astute way of putting it I really want</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.399" end="00:10:47.670" style="s2">to emphasize the process of how we make</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.980" end="00:10:50.759" style="s2">meaning as opposed to what that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.670" end="00:10:52.439" style="s2">that meaning is its structures and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.759" end="00:10:53.689" style="s2">things like I want to understand the how</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.439" end="00:10:56.100" style="s2">and I think this is directly relevant</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.689" end="00:10:57.300" style="s2">for example in one important way to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.100" end="00:10:59.250" style="s2">meaning crisis because knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.300" end="00:11:01.680" style="s2">about what we know but wisdom is much</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.250" end="00:11:03.100" style="s2">more about how we know right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.680" end="00:11:06.010" style="s2">studying this</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.100" end="00:11:08.050" style="s2">how we know and how we make things</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.010" end="00:11:11.580" style="s2">relevant and how we form these</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.050" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">connections and how we write make this</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.580" end="00:11:18.460" style="s2">obvious salience landscaping so that my</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:20.500" style="s2">actions and my thinking seemed just</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.460" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">directly and intuitively appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.500" end="00:11:24.310" style="s2">the circumstances that&#39;s exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:26.290" style="s2">want to know and that&#39;s all relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.310" end="00:11:28.920" style="s2">wisdom we&#39;ve had certainly had the sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.290" end="00:11:31.390" style="s2">since we started putting films out there</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.920" end="00:11:34.300" style="s2">that there&#39;s a real kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.390" end="00:11:37.690" style="s2">awakening going on probably facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.300" end="00:11:39.580" style="s2">by the Internet and I guess since you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.690" end="00:11:41.740" style="s2">been putting out your your films as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.580" end="00:11:43.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a sense that you&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.740" end="00:11:45.580" style="s2">started tapping into that as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.620" end="00:11:47.500" style="s2">what do you make of that what do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.580" end="00:11:50.860" style="s2">make of the kind of the sense that there</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.500" end="00:11:52.510" style="s2">is something happening so I find that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.860" end="00:11:54.580" style="s2">very encouraging I mean I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:11:57.340" style="s2">the reason is like I said there I I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.580" end="00:11:59.650" style="s2">think I&#39;ve arguments in evidence and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.340" end="00:12:01.150" style="s2">this is in self kind of evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.650" end="00:12:02.710" style="s2">there is a meaning crisis people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.150" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">definitely searching and looking and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.710" end="00:12:09.400" style="s2">there&#39;s also I think clear frustration</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:11.290" style="s2">with many of the answers that are on</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.400" end="00:12:14.410" style="s2">offer in the popular culture of the</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.410" end="00:12:18.310" style="s2">established religions I want to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.080" end="00:12:20.380" style="s2">that I think there are people within the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.310" end="00:12:22.950" style="s2">religious framework like Jonathan pezzo</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.380" end="00:12:27.250" style="s2">and Paul van der clay who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.950" end="00:12:28.180" style="s2">I think I think they need to take more</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.250" end="00:12:29.890" style="s2">credit for what they&#39;re trying to do I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.180" end="00:12:32.430" style="s2">think they&#39;re trying to do a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.890" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">serious philosophical overhaul of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.430" end="00:12:37.810" style="s2">Christianity to try and address this</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:40.390" style="s2">emerging crisis so there&#39;s other people</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.810" end="00:12:41.890" style="s2">doing all of this work so that so some</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.390" end="00:12:43.390" style="s2">of the factors there is a meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.890" end="00:12:45.970" style="s2">there&#39;s the frustration with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.390" end="00:12:48.850" style="s2">traditional established political and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.970" end="00:12:51.340" style="s2">even religious responses there&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.850" end="00:12:53.590" style="s2">people out there who are doing this</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.060" end="00:14:40.209" style="s2">intervening you see the problem with</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.140" end="00:15:24.850" style="s2">that I&#39;ve talked about a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.880" end="00:15:27.520" style="s2">I think there&#39;s there&#39;s quite a few</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.520" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.020" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">there is an evolving conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:36.220" style="s2">is kind of headed somewhere and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:38.410" style="s2">the sense of where people think feel</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.220" end="00:15:41.770" style="s2">that it&#39;s headed to is it is an</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.410" end="00:15:44.110" style="s2">integration of the spiritual traditions</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.770" end="00:15:47.500" style="s2">of the religious traditions in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.110" end="00:15:49.470" style="s2">meaningful way after the sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.500" end="00:15:54.310" style="s2">overthrow of the kind of new atheist</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.470" end="00:15:56.290" style="s2">hegemony now there is a sense of again</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.310" end="00:15:57.459" style="s2">rather than kind of writing off all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.290" end="00:15:59.350" style="s2">these things as just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.459" end="00:15:59.980" style="s2">superstitions and things we&#39;ve evolved</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.350" end="00:16:02.260" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.980" end="00:16:06.820" style="s2">I put the potential for an integration</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.260" end="00:16:08.860" style="s2">of the world&#39;s wisdom traditions yes I I</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.820" end="00:16:11.080" style="s2">would agree that&#39;s it that is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.860" end="00:16:14.860" style="s2">how I would put it in what my sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.080" end="00:16:17.230" style="s2">it is as well so I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.860" end="00:16:18.940" style="s2">happening is this integration and both</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.230" end="00:16:20.350" style="s2">sides are changing right so the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.940" end="00:16:22.300" style="s2">we&#39;re doing cognitive science in third</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.350" end="00:16:24.220" style="s2">generation this is the science side the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.300" end="00:16:26.050" style="s2">way we&#39;re doing cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.220" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">third generation cogs is very different</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.050" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">from how we&#39;re doing it in first</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:32.380" style="s2">generation right and so the science is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:34.510" style="s2">changing and the spirituality is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.380" end="00:16:37.990" style="s2">starting to change in this reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.510" end="00:16:39.700" style="s2">manner and so both are gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.990" end="00:16:42.490" style="s2">give ground by the way I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.700" end="00:16:45.760" style="s2">right term because the term I use it</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.490" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">sounds dismissive I try to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.760" end="00:16:55.329" style="s2">trying to salvage what I can from these</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:57.339" style="s2">axial age wisdom wisdom traditions these</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.329" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">systemic sets of psycho technologies for</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.470" end="00:17:08.230" style="s2">those are powerful we have to salvage</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.350" end="00:17:11.140" style="s2">those and my reason for saying that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.230" end="00:17:14.260" style="s2">because they they they were born from an</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.140" end="00:17:17.530" style="s2">hour meshed in the axial revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.260" end="00:17:20.470" style="s2">it&#39;s in its two world mythology and all</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.530" end="00:17:21.939" style="s2">kinds of ways of trying to give us a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.470" end="00:17:24.670" style="s2">grammar for thinking about self</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.829" end="00:17:31.330" style="s2">worldview so all right for example I</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.410" end="00:17:35.080" style="s2">don&#39;t like nostalgic attempts to try and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.330" end="00:17:39.700" style="s2">re-establish the two worldview but</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.080" end="00:17:41.350" style="s2">neither do i do Ally countenance as you</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.700" end="00:17:43.380" style="s2">would say this sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.350" end="00:17:46.450" style="s2">the rejection of all of this as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.380" end="00:17:48.970" style="s2">superstition garbage that so I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.450" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">I I asked my students who are from</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.970" end="00:17:54.010" style="s2">religions regularly and reliably do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:55.720" style="s2">find what I&#39;m doing disrespectful and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.010" end="00:17:58.539" style="s2">they say no you&#39;re being very respectful</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.720" end="00:18:01.450" style="s2">and what you&#39;re doing is valuable to to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.539" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">me and I think the fact that people like</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.450" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">Jonathan and Paul find my work valuable</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:09.160" style="s2">he&#39;s also sort of support for that point</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:10.690" style="s2">but so try and not get the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.160" end="00:18:13.480" style="s2">connotations from this word but I am</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.690" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">trying to salvage from those wisdom</p>

<p begin="00:18:18.130" end="00:18:22.179" style="s2">meaning-making process and more</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.299" end="00:18:36.070" style="s2">what&#39;s very important we talked a minute</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.919" end="00:18:47.530" style="s2">people feel excited by is this sense of</p>

<p begin="00:26:10.659" end="00:26:16.590" style="s2">wisdom right a philosophy so what Ronnie</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.019" end="00:26:19.450" style="s2">helped to do was show how important</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.590" end="00:26:21.309" style="s2">emotions are to our rational agency and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.450" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">then there&#39;s been a lot of work like</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.309" end="00:26:28.330" style="s2">people like DiMaggio in his book des</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:29.649" style="s2">cartes error Montague reads book and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.330" end="00:26:31.210" style="s2">your brain is almost perfect talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.649" end="00:26:33.820" style="s2">about the fundamental difference between</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.210" end="00:26:34.179" style="s2">us and computers as we care and we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.820" end="00:26:36.009" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.179" end="00:26:38.950" style="s2">about the information we&#39;re processing</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.009" end="00:26:42.759" style="s2">it&#39;s precisely because you care that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.950" end="00:26:44.980" style="s2">could do right this this selecting</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.759" end="00:26:46.840" style="s2">what&#39;s obvious so like you know DiMaggio</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.980" end="00:26:48.340" style="s2">studied people and Descartes Sarah where</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.840" end="00:26:50.110" style="s2">there they have a kind of brain damage</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.340" end="00:26:52.330" style="s2">so the computational part of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.110" end="00:26:54.129" style="s2">is working great they can do great</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.330" end="00:26:55.539" style="s2">you know puzzle solving and calculation</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.129" end="00:26:57.639" style="s2">and the inferential stuff on an IQ test</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.539" end="00:27:00.309" style="s2">but if you sort of did this with him if</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.639" end="00:27:02.379" style="s2">you said here&#39;s a red ink pen and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.309" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">a blue ink pen which one do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.379" end="00:27:06.820" style="s2">write the test with they&#39;ll go ah</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:09.340" style="s2">because they try to calculate all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.820" end="00:27:12.999" style="s2">possible permutations right because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.340" end="00:27:13.869" style="s2">capacity to care and right and to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.999" end="00:27:16.269" style="s2">moved</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.869" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what emotions do for you anger is</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.269" end="00:27:20.619" style="s2">just a powerful way in which your</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.619" end="00:27:24.940" style="s2">so that action and identities are</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.659" end="00:27:27.429" style="s2">obvious to you does it work perfectly no</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.940" end="00:27:29.230" style="s2">nothing can we have to give up that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.429" end="00:27:31.929" style="s2">cartesian idea that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.230" end="00:27:35.289" style="s2">like a cognitively perfect form of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.929" end="00:27:37.019" style="s2">cognition but do our emotions absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.289" end="00:27:39.789" style="s2">central to your cognitive agency</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.019" end="00:27:42.519" style="s2">definitely we should go we should we we</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.789" end="00:27:44.700" style="s2">have to see reason and emotion as deeply</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.700" end="00:27:53.049" style="s2">the the idea of the embodied brain how</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:54.490" style="s2">widespread is that how is this sort of</p>

<p begin="00:27:54.490" end="00:27:58.379" style="s2">science sort of cutting edge or is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.200" end="00:28:02.769" style="s2">sort of becoming the accept of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.379" end="00:28:05.740" style="s2">somewhere between those two I think the</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:14.139" style="s2">it&#39;s consensus in cognitive science but</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.499" end="00:28:16.419" style="s2">definitely mainstream although some of</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.419" end="00:28:20.740" style="s2">is still being done there</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.210" end="00:28:24.610" style="s2">what&#39;s heartening to me for example is</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.740" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">that these ideas that are becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.610" end="00:28:29.230" style="s2">prevalent to machine learning in one</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:30.850" style="s2">Emily in one sense and that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.230" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">definitely becoming more prevalent in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.850" end="00:28:34.659" style="s2">cognitive science and the philosophy of</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.659" end="00:28:42.249" style="s2">and what is the kind of real-world</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.200" end="00:28:44.679" style="s2">impact of this cognitive science it does</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.249" end="00:28:47.160" style="s2">it suggests that we that we should all</p>

<p begin="00:28:51.090" end="00:28:57.210" style="s2">what&#39;s the real world relevance of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.800" end="00:28:59.610" style="s2">well there&#39;s there&#39;s two in very</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.210" end="00:29:01.470" style="s2">different directions I mean one myself</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.610" end="00:29:03.330" style="s2">in Evin for example and other people</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.470" end="00:29:05.190" style="s2">Francisco Varela there is this growing</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.330" end="00:29:07.860" style="s2">confluence between third generation cog</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.190" end="00:29:09.690" style="s2">saw and traditional sets of psycho</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.690" end="00:29:13.920" style="s2">and cognition like Buddhism and Taoist</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:16.530" style="s2">practices I even have a course at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.920" end="00:29:18.150" style="s2">University of Toronto called Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.530" end="00:29:22.620" style="s2">and cog side where I try and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.150" end="00:29:24.270" style="s2">and explore that that confluence it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.620" end="00:29:25.980" style="s2">actually the progenitor to the video</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.270" end="00:29:27.330" style="s2">series in important ways and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.980" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">grateful for the opportunity to teach</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.330" end="00:29:31.740" style="s2">that course and so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:33.150" style="s2">definitely the case but the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.740" end="00:29:35.790" style="s2">I think there&#39;s other I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.150" end="00:29:37.260" style="s2">giving us a way and this is also part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.790" end="00:29:39.090" style="s2">the real world impact I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.260" end="00:29:41.100" style="s2">giving and this really matters it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.090" end="00:29:44.310" style="s2">giving people a new vocabulary for</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.100" end="00:29:47.130" style="s2">talking about existential and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.310" end="00:29:49.980" style="s2">meaning and transformation that I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.130" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">is really really important people need</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.980" end="00:29:54.990" style="s2">to be able to articulate their</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:58.380" style="s2">experience to remove you know confusion</p>

<p begin="00:30:00.750" end="00:30:05.280" style="s2">this is afforded by this enriched and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.180" end="00:30:07.110" style="s2">think empowering vocabulary and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.280" end="00:30:09.690" style="s2">third thing is one that is going it has</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.110" end="00:30:11.220" style="s2">been and is going to increasingly make</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.690" end="00:30:13.500" style="s2">an impact on the meaning crisis which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.220" end="00:30:16.230" style="s2">the advent of you know autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.500" end="00:30:18.030" style="s2">artificial general intelligence which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.230" end="00:30:21.060" style="s2">coming that that is definitely coming</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.030" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">and that&#39;s gonna make an impact on our</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.730" end="00:30:34.230" style="s2">in something we&#39;ve noticed in the people</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.250" end="00:32:46.809" style="s2">with others and then that it gets it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.929" end="00:32:50.049" style="s2">meshed right and that&#39;s fine but I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.809" end="00:32:52.269" style="s2">the how of these states the way they</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.049" end="00:32:55.690" style="s2">optimize our relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.269" end="00:32:57.580" style="s2">transform it and enable something sort</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.559" end="00:33:02.769" style="s2">sort of locked in schematic ways of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.299" end="00:33:04.870" style="s2">thinking and they make all of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.769" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">systematic errors and then they have you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.870" end="00:33:08.679" style="s2">know appear as yet en you know change</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:11.799" style="s2">and they go from one stage to another</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.679" end="00:33:13.549" style="s2">and although that system of illusions</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.799" end="00:33:15.590" style="s2">that they were prey to has</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.549" end="00:33:18.499" style="s2">in a way and I think you see the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.590" end="00:33:21.470" style="s2">kind of attempt to become sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.499" end="00:33:23.570" style="s2">and be able to intervene in systemic</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.929" end="00:33:35.929" style="s2">optimize better how to get a grip on</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.989" end="00:33:38.210" style="s2">reality to connect to reality and to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.929" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">this sort of reciprocal realization they</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.769" end="00:33:49.129" style="s2">manner and I think that is all something</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:52.059" style="s2">that cognitive science is and will</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.129" end="00:33:54.529" style="s2">increasingly say more and more about so</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.059" end="00:33:57.489" style="s2">are you saying that these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.529" end="00:34:01.820" style="s2">awakening experiences are part of our</p>

<p begin="00:34:02.809" end="00:34:09.950" style="s2">inevitable thing right I think what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.419" end="00:34:14.089" style="s2">are is they they are a genuine option</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.950" end="00:34:16.250" style="s2">for us for a form of self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.089" end="00:34:18.790" style="s2">that we can render scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.250" end="00:34:22.250" style="s2">legitimate by understanding the way it</p>

<p begin="00:34:24.859" end="00:34:31.970" style="s2">meaning making what so I I need a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.049" end="00:34:33.409" style="s2">bit more specific I mean I can talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.970" end="00:34:34.669" style="s2">about how sort of we evolved as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.409" end="00:34:36.649" style="s2">species that I can talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.669" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">cultural of evolution like things like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.649" end="00:34:41.750" style="s2">the actual revolution and I understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:44.210" style="s2">that and I do think part of what the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.750" end="00:34:47.329" style="s2">series has tried to do is point out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.210" end="00:34:49.609" style="s2">deep connection between the invention of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.329" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">psycho technologies and their</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.609" end="00:34:54.770" style="s2">internalization and then that how that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:56.809" style="s2">transforms the how of cognition let me</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.770" end="00:34:59.180" style="s2">give you a a a I think a</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.809" end="00:35:00.829" style="s2">non-controversial example so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.180" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">things I would argue that drove and many</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.829" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">people would agree with this is not just</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:09.170" style="s2">my claim that drove the the axial</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:10.369" style="s2">revolution of around 800 BC to 300 BC</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.170" end="00:35:12.380" style="s2">this is when the great world religions</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.910" end="00:35:18.380" style="s2">is being invented right Karl Jasper&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.099" end="00:35:20.180" style="s2">originally put his finger on this Karen</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.380" end="00:35:21.579" style="s2">Armstrong has wrote a really good book</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.180" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">on this called the great transformation</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.579" end="00:35:25.970" style="s2">anyways one of the things that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:26.900" style="s2">on especially in the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.970" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">Mediterranean is</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.900" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">the invention of alphabetic literacy</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:33.319" style="s2">right so before that you have like</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">ideograph like I have like ideograms a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.319" end="00:35:37.220" style="s2">tattooed on my arm right but you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:39.859" style="s2">India graphic higher grip you have all</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.220" end="00:35:41.660" style="s2">these very complex and and so being</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.859" end="00:35:43.099" style="s2">literate is a very demanding thing in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.660" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">fact your job in the ancient world is</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.099" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">you can be ascribed which means your</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:49.010" style="s2">only job is and it&#39;s a good job is</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.880" end="00:35:50.660" style="s2">you&#39;re literate alright and so a small</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.010" end="00:35:53.510" style="s2">percentage of the population is literate</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.660" end="00:35:55.880" style="s2">when you get alphabetic literacy the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.510" end="00:35:57.859" style="s2">really amount some people I think have</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.880" end="00:36:00.680" style="s2">estimated it it&#39;s well surround 20% of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.859" end="00:36:02.660" style="s2">the population becomes literate right</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.680" end="00:36:06.829" style="s2">now think about what that psycho</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.660" end="00:36:09.170" style="s2">technology does to you does for you okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.829" end="00:36:12.200" style="s2">you have deeply internalized it it is so</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.170" end="00:36:13.609" style="s2">automatic to you right if I put a word</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.200" end="00:36:14.990" style="s2">up in front of you and say look at this</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.609" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">and don&#39;t read it you won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.990" end="00:36:19.970" style="s2">do it right it&#39;s absolutely transparent</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:22.250" style="s2">it&#39;s so internalized to your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.970" end="00:36:24.200" style="s2">you probably think in sentences in your</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.250" end="00:36:27.740" style="s2">head but think about what literacy does</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.200" end="00:36:30.380" style="s2">to your cognition okay it I can now</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.740" end="00:36:32.599" style="s2">store my thoughts external to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.380" end="00:36:34.849" style="s2">can come back later and revise them so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.599" end="00:36:36.799" style="s2">could connect previous instances of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.849" end="00:36:40.130" style="s2">brain to current instances that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.799" end="00:36:43.069" style="s2">massively increases right the processing</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.130" end="00:36:45.500" style="s2">power I can I can link my processing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.069" end="00:36:48.200" style="s2">your processing I can step back and look</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.500" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">at it at length rather than trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.200" end="00:36:53.480" style="s2">hold it in working memory all of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:55.910" style="s2">means I can massively self-correct my</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.480" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">own cognition so try and do this thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.910" end="00:37:01.309" style="s2">experiment with me think about all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:02.660" style="s2">problems you&#39;re solving day to day basis</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.309" end="00:37:05.900" style="s2">all the information you&#39;re processing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.660" end="00:37:07.930" style="s2">now I take literacy from you most of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.900" end="00:37:10.220" style="s2">those problems are now insoluble by you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.930" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">you can&#39;t you can&#39;t do it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.220" end="00:37:13.339" style="s2">process the information you can&#39;t access</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.839" end="00:37:14.660" style="s2">the information you can&#39;t hold the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.339" end="00:37:16.309" style="s2">information you can&#39;t distribute the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.660" end="00:37:19.309" style="s2">information that&#39;s what psycho</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.309" end="00:37:22.039" style="s2">technologies do and what happens is they</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.309" end="00:37:24.190" style="s2">get invented for practical purposes but</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.039" end="00:37:27.829" style="s2">then they get internalized they permeate</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.190" end="00:37:29.240" style="s2">the functionality of our cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.829" end="00:37:31.250" style="s2">then they transform us</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.240" end="00:37:33.170" style="s2">so people because are things like</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.250" end="00:37:34.940" style="s2">alphabetic literacy because of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.170" end="00:37:36.740" style="s2">increased power and the increased</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.940" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">awareness of their own cognition they</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.740" end="00:37:40.170" style="s2">got a much greater sense of how this</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:43.290" style="s2">meaning making in their</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.170" end="00:37:45.660" style="s2">mind distorts reality and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.290" end="00:37:50.339" style="s2">helps afford the whole axle revolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.660" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">so our cognition is there&#39;s a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.339" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">cultural evolution to our cognition so</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:58.859" style="s2">that things we take to be natural are</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:38:01.140" style="s2">actually internalized via psycho</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.859" end="00:38:04.170" style="s2">technologies from our culture and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.140" end="00:38:06.150" style="s2">and of course the internet and other</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.170" end="00:38:09.240" style="s2">things that our smartphones are also</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.150" end="00:38:12.329" style="s2">doing that we are naturally born cyborgs</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.240" end="00:38:14.819" style="s2">are our brains evolved to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.329" end="00:38:16.710" style="s2">these psycho technologies and physical</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.819" end="00:38:19.770" style="s2">technologies and the thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.710" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">internet is it that&#39;s doing it in a huge</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.770" end="00:38:26.579" style="s2">ways we don&#39;t yet understand great place</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.530" end="00:38:42.930" style="s2">don&#39;t want to give it away for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.230" end="00:38:44.790" style="s2">okay yeah we&#39;ve already filmed 28 and so</p>
