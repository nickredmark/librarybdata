<p begin="00:00:00.260" end="00:00:05.130" style="s2">hi this is Eric Weinstein thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.330" end="00:00:06.450" style="s2">coming back to my youtube channel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.130" end="00:00:08.550" style="s2">been a little while since I posted that</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.450" end="00:00:10.620" style="s2">first video asking for suggestions what</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:12.269" style="s2">content I might try to put out and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.620" end="00:00:13.889" style="s2">gotten a lot of great feedback so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.269" end="00:00:15.450" style="s2">been looking at your comments and been</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.889" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">thinking about what videos might be the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.450" end="00:00:19.080" style="s2">most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:21.930" style="s2">I thought however I should start first</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.080" end="00:00:25.140" style="s2">with a question of why the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.930" end="00:00:27.480" style="s2">dark web has such a crazy name so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.140" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">believe that I&#39;m guilty I introduced the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.480" end="00:00:32.099" style="s2">phrase intellectual dark web on stage at</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:34.980" style="s2">the Masonic theatre with ben shapiro and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.099" end="00:00:37.140" style="s2">sam harris and then sam titled that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.980" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">episode of his podcast the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.140" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">dark web and that was later amplified by</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:43.829" style="s2">barry weiss and others on Barry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:46.500" style="s2">article the new york times particularly</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.829" end="00:00:49.200" style="s2">about a lot of play so a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.500" end="00:00:50.969" style="s2">have asked why does this why does this</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:52.500" style="s2">movement have such a strange and crazy</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.969" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">name and i thought i would talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.500" end="00:00:57.090" style="s2">bit about the thinking that went into it</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:01:00.120" style="s2">given that the first wave of reactions i</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.090" end="00:01:02.750" style="s2">think has really started to peter out so</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.120" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">there&#39;s still some a few fresh takes but</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.750" end="00:01:07.320" style="s2">for the most part the big players have</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">already commented and I wanted to let</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.320" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">that time pass before I clarified it</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:15.270" style="s2">further alright so there&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:18.509" style="s2">of design behind the name the central</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.270" end="00:01:21.780" style="s2">thesis is that what is now called the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.509" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">commentariat was always going to hate</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">both the emergent phenomenon of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">movement and hate any name that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">attach to it why is that is it because</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">the ideas are terrible is it because the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:34.740" style="s2">people involved in the movement are</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.430" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">deplorable I don&#39;t think so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.740" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">specifically because what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">intellectual dark web actually is is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:45.720" style="s2">alternative sense making collective so</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">in this case these so-called IDW will</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.720" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">take what is ever happening in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">and will try to analyze it but very</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:54.290" style="s2">often it sounds very different than what</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">you see in typical mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.290" end="00:02:00.140" style="s2">publications particularly those that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">on the left and depended upon for</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.140" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">curating the interpretations of what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:07.380" style="s2">happening in the world so whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">the Atlantic or national public radio or</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.380" end="00:02:10.860" style="s2">the New York Times these organizations</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:14.070" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.860" end="00:02:15.990" style="s2">recently behave quite differently than</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.070" end="00:02:18.870" style="s2">many of us remember them let&#39;s say 20</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.990" end="00:02:20.880" style="s2">years ago the so called commentary at</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.870" end="00:02:22.590" style="s2">that is the people who regularly give</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.880" end="00:02:25.530" style="s2">their takes on what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.590" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">world seem to have been somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.530" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">captured by a new network which thinks</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:34.020" style="s2">in terms that are very different to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:37.530" style="s2">networks that have previously lived at</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.020" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">these organizations and as a result I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.530" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">believe that the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">is going to be perceived as rivals and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">then therefore instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:48.690" style="s2">commentariat giving an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.760" style="s2">assessment of what we&#39;re doing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.690" end="00:02:52.470" style="s2">going to view us as a rival to their</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.760" end="00:02:54.470" style="s2">business model and they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.470" end="00:02:57.239" style="s2">attack on those two on those terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.470" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">therefore because of their power and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.239" end="00:03:01.170" style="s2">influence which while waning is still</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:04.910" style="s2">considerable we always knew that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.170" end="00:03:07.739" style="s2">whatever name this this phenomenon had</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.910" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">it was always going to be beaten up by</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.739" end="00:03:12.030" style="s2">the commentary so what we decided or</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">least what I decided in introducing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.030" end="00:03:17.190" style="s2">name was to use what I call a Nesta</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:19.350" style="s2">fadjen strategy now that word I guess is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.190" end="00:03:21.600" style="s2">Portuguese and it comes from the process</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.350" end="00:03:24.600" style="s2">that produces the wine named Madeira and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.600" end="00:03:26.310" style="s2">Madeira is really distinguished because</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.600" end="00:03:29.459" style="s2">it&#39;s the only one that I know that when</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.310" end="00:03:30.989" style="s2">you open it up you can leave it open and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.459" end="00:03:33.269" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t go bad it doesn&#39;t behave like</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.989" end="00:03:35.430" style="s2">a normal agricultural product why is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.269" end="00:03:37.590" style="s2">that because it&#39;s been subjected to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.430" end="00:03:39.500" style="s2">heating an oxidization in the process</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.590" end="00:03:43.170" style="s2">called as the Faja</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.500" end="00:03:45.690" style="s2">therefore the product is more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.170" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">born to use in the same Talib&#39;s phrase</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.690" end="00:03:51.600" style="s2">in an anti fragile state that was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:55.739" style="s2">idea behind naming this movement the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.600" end="00:03:59.340" style="s2">intellectual dark web or IDW as a result</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.739" end="00:04:00.709" style="s2">because it&#39;s got such a crazy and some</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.340" end="00:04:03.420" style="s2">people would say cringe-worthy or</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.709" end="00:04:05.430" style="s2">disturbing or self-important name it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.420" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">hard to beat up on it further than it</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.430" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">already has been beaten up on at birth</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:12.510" style="s2">so from inception it&#39;s a very easy thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">to make fun of that guaranteed that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.510" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">would have high mimetic acceptance that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:19.200" style="s2">is the commentariat actually in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">sense loves the name and so they would</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.200" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">spread it so if you like it&#39;s also a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:24.139" style="s2">of a Trojan horse strategy and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:25.729" style="s2">what they did</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.139" end="00:04:27.289" style="s2">they spread this name far and wide</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.729" end="00:04:30.139" style="s2">making fun of it as much as they could</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.289" end="00:04:31.669" style="s2">and the fun part about it is that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.139" end="00:04:33.409" style="s2">are a couple of jokes in the name which</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.669" end="00:04:36.169" style="s2">I will now explain since I think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.409" end="00:04:39.139" style="s2">they&#39;ve kind of out outlived their</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.169" end="00:04:40.129" style="s2">usefulness as jokes the first one is on</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.139" end="00:04:42.830" style="s2">the word dark</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.129" end="00:04:44.810" style="s2">now the word dark has two basic</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:47.210" style="s2">interpretations here the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.810" end="00:04:51.020" style="s2">interpretation is something that&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.210" end="00:04:53.449" style="s2">to find so if you go dark it means that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.020" end="00:04:55.460" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of in stealth mode now we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.449" end="00:04:57.439" style="s2">have not really been in stealth mode as</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.460" end="00:05:02.360" style="s2">many people have pointed out for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.439" end="00:05:04.430" style="s2">paul krugman my policy under now why is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.360" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">that funny well it&#39;s funny because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.430" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">only people to whom we&#39;ve been dark have</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:11.029" style="s2">been the mainstream media which had not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:14.689" style="s2">wanted to talk about a rival</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.029" end="00:05:19.099" style="s2">sense-making network so in essence</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.689" end="00:05:22.089" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen very few opportunities to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.099" end="00:05:24.349" style="s2">engage with these ideas at the main</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.089" end="00:05:27.020" style="s2">media institutions that have</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.349" end="00:05:28.520" style="s2">traditionally been behind the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.020" end="00:05:30.050" style="s2">of intellectual matters in the United</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.520" end="00:05:34.039" style="s2">States and elsewhere at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.050" end="00:05:35.659" style="s2">Anglophone world so part of it is a joke</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.039" end="00:05:39.699" style="s2">on the media which is that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.659" end="00:05:43.370" style="s2">want particularly to feature us as</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.699" end="00:05:46.370" style="s2">responsible and interesting commentators</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.370" end="00:05:48.409" style="s2">on events they instead prefer to either</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.370" end="00:05:50.599" style="s2">treat us as strange and controversial</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.409" end="00:05:53.810" style="s2">figures like controversial professor</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.599" end="00:05:58.610" style="s2">Jordan Peterson or far-right activist</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.810" end="00:06:02.060" style="s2">Ben Shapiro or noted Islam critic Sam</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.610" end="00:06:03.770" style="s2">Harris now in so doing what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.060" end="00:06:06.949" style="s2">doing is they&#39;re setting you up with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.770" end="00:06:10.399" style="s2">idea that these people hold ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.949" end="00:06:13.550" style="s2">are perhaps not savory not acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.399" end="00:06:15.860" style="s2">and that gets to the second issue going</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.550" end="00:06:19.699" style="s2">on with the word dark the other notion</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.860" end="00:06:22.610" style="s2">of dark here is evil or morally bankrupt</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.699" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of the joke too because</p>

<p begin="00:09:21.570" end="00:09:25.620" style="s2">covered well in fact what was going</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.300" end="00:09:28.410" style="s2">wrong was is that it was a</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.410" end="00:09:34.860" style="s2">story of an eruption of racism but</p>

<p begin="00:09:43.079" end="00:09:47.459" style="s2">reported and therefore there was a three</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.300" end="00:09:49.620" style="s2">and a half week gap between when the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.459" end="00:09:53.160" style="s2">story unfolded and when they finally</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.620" end="00:09:55.110" style="s2">wrote a first terrible news piece even</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.160" end="00:09:57.779" style="s2">after two opinion pieces had already</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.110" end="00:10:00.089" style="s2">been written so this is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.779" end="00:10:02.399" style="s2">from our perspective is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.089" end="00:10:04.470" style="s2">suddenly all sorts of stories that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.399" end="00:10:06.180" style="s2">be reported honestly because they go</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.300" end="00:12:33.780" style="s2">fair and that any deviation from 50/50</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.510" end="00:13:16.530" style="s2">to anyone because chess isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.190" end="00:13:51.320" style="s2">understood that but there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.190" end="00:13:54.110" style="s2">hostility because he used words like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.320" end="00:13:58.220" style="s2">genotype and phenotype as a biologist</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.110" end="00:14:00.290" style="s2">which the activists at Evergreen State</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.220" end="00:14:03.080" style="s2">took to be evidence that he was clearly</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.290" end="00:14:05.150" style="s2">a racist which I&#39;m sorry to say is one</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.080" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">of the stupidest things I&#39;ve ever heard</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.150" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">in my life if I hadn&#39;t seen it on video</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:10.550" style="s2">I would not believe that people were</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.980" style="s2">capable of making that argument it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.550" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">just a shock and the fact that that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.980" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">style of argumentation has spread so</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.970" style="s2">quickly and it&#39;s penetrated the organs</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.350" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">that we have always depended upon and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.970" end="00:14:25.640" style="s2">have a very long and storied history I</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:28.940" style="s2">think is probably what animates the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.640" end="00:14:31.790" style="s2">intellectual dark web so dekappa to wrap</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.940" end="00:14:33.530" style="s2">up the the reasons for the name the idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.790" end="00:14:36.020" style="s2">was we wanted to create a name that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.530" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">highly mimetic we knew it was going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.020" end="00:14:41.590" style="s2">be beaten up on we wanted it to be born</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:43.550" style="s2">anti fragile and we wanted it also to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.590" end="00:14:47.660" style="s2">understandable as an emergent phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.550" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">so you know whether or not I named it it</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.660" end="00:14:52.460" style="s2">was always going to be a thing if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:54.920" style="s2">come to any of the shows that we do in</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.460" end="00:14:57.740" style="s2">different cities if you watch the view</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.920" end="00:15:00.350" style="s2">counts even when the platforms like</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.740" end="00:15:03.230" style="s2">YouTube and Twitter seems to me not make</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.350" end="00:15:05.780" style="s2">our lives easy this has tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.230" end="00:15:07.550" style="s2">traction people are incredibly excited</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.780" end="00:15:11.510" style="s2">about finding that there is some place</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.550" end="00:15:16.730" style="s2">to discuss ideas again and furthermore</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.510" end="00:15:21.710" style="s2">that we can do so decently without you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.730" end="00:15:24.110" style="s2">know in general resorting to epithet and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.710" end="00:15:27.200" style="s2">reputational destruction unless somebody</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.110" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">else usually initiates hostility towards</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.200" end="00:15:30.930" style="s2">us I think it&#39;s an incredibly hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:32.220" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.930" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">and I want to say more about it in</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.220" end="00:15:36.810" style="s2">future videos as to what it what really</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:38.910" style="s2">characterizes the movement what its</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.810" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">interests are but I wanted to begin by</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.910" end="00:15:45.960" style="s2">letting you know that the crazy name is</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">not an accident it&#39;s really born out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.960" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">a frustration that we know that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.000" end="00:15:52.770" style="s2">going up against the people that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:55.410" style="s2">usually have depended upon to curate</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.770" end="00:15:57.690" style="s2">your world and its interpretations and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.410" end="00:16:00.300" style="s2">what we are is a rival curation Network</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.690" end="00:16:02.070" style="s2">and we don&#39;t agree with each other I</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.300" end="00:16:04.260" style="s2">mean you know one of the funny things</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.070" end="00:16:05.670" style="s2">about it is that we&#39;re frequently told</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.260" end="00:16:07.770" style="s2">that we are a right-of-center</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.670" end="00:16:10.520" style="s2">organization where if I have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.770" end="00:16:12.930" style="s2">honest when I sit inside the network I</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.520" end="00:16:15.870" style="s2">definitely think it has a left-of-centre</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.930" end="00:16:18.149" style="s2">bias and the fact that the left is so</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.870" end="00:16:22.610" style="s2">far gone that it sees that as right of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.149" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">center I think you know speaks volumes I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.610" end="00:16:28.830" style="s2">think about oh I don&#39;t know Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:31.620" style="s2">Brett Weinstein myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.830" end="00:16:33.570" style="s2">Sam Harris Heather huiying there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.620" end="00:16:36.529" style="s2">shortage of people on the left and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.570" end="00:16:39.570" style="s2">would definitely say that the movement</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.529" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">is in general not particularly friendly</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.570" end="00:16:44.040" style="s2">to the current administration sitting</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">inside of the White House and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.040" end="00:16:49.170" style="s2">that it can&#39;t be understood or or</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:50.910" style="s2">reported to be what it actually is is in</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.170" end="00:16:52.860" style="s2">part what we wanted to show you we want</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.910" end="00:16:55.830" style="s2">to show you the failure of the comment</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.860" end="00:16:57.690" style="s2">area and I think that until you see this</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.830" end="00:17:01.020" style="s2">layer which prefers to be almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.690" end="00:17:05.970" style="s2">invisible by by virtue of making itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.020" end="00:17:08.429" style="s2">nearly I don&#39;t know well maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.970" end="00:17:10.050" style="s2">translucent you can sort of see it a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.429" end="00:17:12.030" style="s2">little bit but they really want you to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.050" end="00:17:13.500" style="s2">focus on their interpretation of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.030" end="00:17:15.929" style="s2">facts rather than the facts themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.500" end="00:17:18.839" style="s2">and by calling too much attention to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.929" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">themselves that goes away I think what</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.839" end="00:17:23.459" style="s2">we what we&#39;re trying to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:25.829" style="s2">highlight that the curation is almost at</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.459" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">the level of a Potemkin village you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.829" end="00:17:32.580" style="s2">being shown very limited perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:37.020" style="s2">and you&#39;re seeing a lot of variation</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.580" end="00:17:39.270" style="s2">around these perspectives but maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.020" end="00:17:42.330" style="s2">real action is a million miles away from</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.270" end="00:17:44.230" style="s2">the sort of center of mass as determined</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.330" end="00:17:46.600" style="s2">by the left and right wing comment</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.230" end="00:17:48.730" style="s2">as we now understand so I think with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.600" end="00:17:51.580" style="s2">intellectual dark Weber IDW is going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.730" end="00:17:54.850" style="s2">do is going to move that considerably</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.580" end="00:17:57.940" style="s2">the move the folk the fossa and left and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.850" end="00:18:00.190" style="s2">right considerably off of where the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.940" end="00:18:01.809" style="s2">normal media institutions have been</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.190" end="00:18:04.540" style="s2">discussing matters particularly on</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.809" end="00:18:10.830" style="s2">matters like trade immigration terror</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.540" end="00:18:15.610" style="s2">and and let&#39;s say workplace opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.830" end="00:18:17.140" style="s2">so I hope you&#39;ll get excited about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.610" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll start to see the humor in it</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.140" end="00:18:21.580" style="s2">because we throw out a MacGuffin and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:24.520" style="s2">sure enough the commentary at everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.580" end="00:18:26.500" style="s2">in the comment area saw exactly what it</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.520" end="00:18:29.230" style="s2">was that they wanted to see maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.500" end="00:18:32.590" style="s2">were an anti-semitic Network maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.230" end="00:18:34.450" style="s2">were an overly Jewish Network some</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.590" end="00:18:37.900" style="s2">people saw us as being almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.450" end="00:18:42.130" style="s2">exclusively male some people saw this as</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.900" end="00:18:44.710" style="s2">an ethnic network all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.130" end="00:18:48.010" style="s2">are just not true and that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.710" end="00:18:49.650" style="s2">funny it&#39;s amusing we hope you&#39;re in on</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.010" end="00:18:51.850" style="s2">the joke now and we hope that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.650" end="00:18:53.770" style="s2">furthermore it&#39;s not a terrible name</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.850" end="00:18:56.530" style="s2">once you get used to it so get excited</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.770" end="00:18:58.809" style="s2">there&#39;s more to come and thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.530" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">watching and greetings from the IDW be</p>
