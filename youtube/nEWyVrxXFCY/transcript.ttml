<p begin="00:00:02.340" end="00:00:06.750" style="s2">have to recreate a railroad we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:09.660" style="s2">have to recreate a lot of what we can we</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.750" end="00:00:11.639" style="s2">can work backwards from there but we it</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.660" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">gives us the power and the tools to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:15.420" style="s2">what we need to do without the downside</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:18.090" style="s2">of it being owned by Google and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.420" end="00:00:19.470" style="s2">and which is that we don&#39;t trust it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.090" end="00:00:22.949" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing it together and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.470" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">own it together and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.949" end="00:00:28.349" style="s2">what we can do together that they will</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:31.080" style="s2">never be able to do that we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.349" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">out-compete them with like they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.080" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">transparent in the fact that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">collect our data they kind of are but</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">like we get that it&#39;s only used to sell</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">us more stuff that is also destroying</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:46.140" style="s2">our plan whereas when we collect our</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:48.149" style="s2">data in a way that is empowering to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.140" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">like where you get to hold it and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.149" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">get to decide whether you use it for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:53.460" style="s2">collective good and you&#39;re good you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">only going to give up your data if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.460" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">get a direct benefit and you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">group benefit so if we give up our data</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">in a wait it&#39;s safe so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">necessarily attribute it back to me</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:05.129" style="s2">right you can&#39;t look up like my medical</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">information but if my medical</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">information is washed and available to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:11.130" style="s2">the whole those are that&#39;s the way we</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">can like cure cancer that&#39;s the way when</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.130" end="00:01:17.130" style="s2">if what I spend money on is is washed</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">and made it safe and then we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">use that data we can recreate the entire</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">means of production when it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">to do so right to be like hey your whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">neighborhood is buying this thing what</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">if you work together to create it what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">if you you know and designing the tools</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">to be able to implement those solutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:37.500" style="s2">when anyone comes up with a new idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:39.840" style="s2">instead of them needing to go through</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.500" end="00:01:41.729" style="s2">the arduous process of creating a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.840" end="00:01:44.390" style="s2">business and seeing if it&#39;s viable in</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.729" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">the market in competition game a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.390" end="00:01:49.140" style="s2">landscape they can bring it to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">collective and say hey how do we this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.140" end="00:01:52.890" style="s2">the spark of an idea how do we make it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">better how do we make it so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.890" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">everybody wins</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">because the idea is in the co-operative</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">any new person who joins is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">with them their data their ideas their</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">experience in a way that you never want</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">the only way we were limiting who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">coming on board is if you can&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.210" style="s2">accept more people right if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.270" end="00:02:15.460" style="s2">limited servers</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.210" end="00:02:19.660" style="s2">to 10,000 people you can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.460" end="00:02:20.830" style="s2">jump to 10 million but we want to jump</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.660" end="00:02:22.390" style="s2">to 10 million so we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.830" end="00:02:24.310" style="s2">incentivized to like okay how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.390" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">double and then double and then double</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.310" end="00:02:36.430" style="s2">in a way that is sustainable yep so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:39.010" style="s2">get it and the reason why I get it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.430" end="00:02:41.800" style="s2">that in fact like even your example</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.010" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">about the credit unions I barked up that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.800" end="00:02:49.090" style="s2">tree myself and in in and it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:51.190" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re in Canada yeah so uh in in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.090" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">the states I ended up I think at some</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.190" end="00:02:54.760" style="s2">point even had a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:56.950" style="s2">somebody who was part of the federal</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.760" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">agency that manages or governs credit</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.950" end="00:03:01.240" style="s2">unions because precisely I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:02.890" style="s2">figure out how do you hack that system</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.240" end="00:03:05.320" style="s2">to get something that could scale and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.890" end="00:03:05.890" style="s2">she was great because she said look</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.320" end="00:03:10.120" style="s2">here&#39;s a deal</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.890" end="00:03:11.620" style="s2">betting can happen like the is the rules</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.120" end="00:03:12.820" style="s2">and it was really gonna happen and well</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.620" end="00:03:14.500" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is definitely in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.820" end="00:03:15.190" style="s2">rules I guarantee you they&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.500" end="00:03:16.780" style="s2">let this happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.190" end="00:03:19.270" style="s2">which is a good like a good learning</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.780" end="00:03:22.270" style="s2">experience about kind of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.270" end="00:03:30.250" style="s2">what&#39;s happening but yes and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.270" end="00:03:31.600" style="s2">next thing I&#39;m nodding yes at is sorry</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.250" end="00:03:34.330" style="s2">the way that I think it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.600" end="00:03:37.420" style="s2">for me to express and I get that easy</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.330" end="00:03:41.380" style="s2">term and I appreciate you trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.420" end="00:03:43.150" style="s2">it easy do you do you by any chance do</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.380" end="00:03:45.970" style="s2">you happen to listen to the the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.150" end="00:03:48.550" style="s2">that I did recently with that guy called</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.970" end="00:03:50.050" style="s2">venture stories I was just listening to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.550" end="00:03:51.910" style="s2">it before talking to you and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.050" end="00:03:54.070" style="s2">lot of language I did not understand but</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.910" end="00:03:57.880" style="s2">because part of it is in my backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.070" end="00:03:59.860" style="s2">I am I got bit for sure big chunks of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.880" end="00:04:03.070" style="s2">what you were you were trying to say so</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.860" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">I only listened to about half of it the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.070" end="00:04:07.480" style="s2">second half weirdly but I dropped the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:09.670" style="s2">ball in the last ten minutes because he</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.480" end="00:04:11.800" style="s2">he had a he has to question where he</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.670" end="00:04:13.000" style="s2">involved a invoked economist I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.800" end="00:04:14.620" style="s2">know in the economist it become this was</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.000" end="00:04:15.940" style="s2">basically saying sort of margret</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.620" end="00:04:17.830" style="s2">thatcher&#39;s thing of like yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.940" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">unsustainable but you know maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.830" end="00:04:22.450" style="s2">thousand years before collapses and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:23.620" style="s2">else is there and and the answer is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.450" end="00:04:24.490" style="s2">there is something else in fact not only</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">is there something else but that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.490" end="00:04:30.530" style="s2">something else is if you just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">clearly and what has been emerging in</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.530" end="00:04:34.460" style="s2">the context of what we&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">doing you see it happening you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.460" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">story that I the ultimately I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">share here cuz I probably already got it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:44.600" style="s2">so we&#39;re just basically nodding heads at</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:46.370" style="s2">each other for a little while is if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.600" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">take a look at industrial capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.370" end="00:04:50.060" style="s2">go let&#39;s not go all the way back let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">start with like trains so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.060" end="00:04:56.570" style="s2">iron and steel and and machinery and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:58.039" style="s2">kind of do a snapshot every phase change</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.570" end="00:05:00.500" style="s2">every major upgrade so you kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.039" end="00:05:02.419" style="s2">Carnegie steel and you do Ford Motors</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.500" end="00:05:04.850" style="s2">and then you do General Electric and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.419" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">then you jump into IBM and then you jump</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.850" end="00:05:11.860" style="s2">into HP and you jump into Apple and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:13.820" style="s2">you jump into Google what you see is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.860" end="00:05:15.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a line it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.820" end="00:05:18.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a movement that happens where</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.740" end="00:05:21.800" style="s2">the humans the individual humans become</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.590" end="00:05:25.880" style="s2">more and more important and the context</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.800" end="00:05:28.310" style="s2">becomes more and more humane because it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.880" end="00:05:30.860" style="s2">is in the collaborative capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.310" end="00:05:33.320" style="s2">creative collaboration is increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.860" end="00:05:36.710" style="s2">becoming the obvious center of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.320" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">being done and so I have to do sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.710" end="00:05:39.889" style="s2">extend that a little bit I draw a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:41.030" style="s2">just okay what&#39;s next like what&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.889" end="00:05:42.409" style="s2">that error we&#39;ve got an error of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.030" end="00:05:44.449" style="s2">got this really great vector that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.409" end="00:05:46.669" style="s2">can just sort of draw now just imagine</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.449" end="00:05:48.289" style="s2">you should project that vector one step</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.669" end="00:05:51.349" style="s2">further that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.289" end="00:05:52.760" style="s2">saying hey let&#39;s just fully realize the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.349" end="00:05:54.440" style="s2">thing that&#39;s been unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.760" end="00:05:58.070" style="s2">happening industrial capitalism make it</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.440" end="00:05:59.419" style="s2">conscious uh-huh funny I actually not</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.070" end="00:06:00.949" style="s2">intending the phrase conscious</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.419" end="00:06:04.539" style="s2">capitalism which i think is an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.949" end="00:06:08.930" style="s2">not do this but let&#39;s make that thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.539" end="00:06:10.970" style="s2">self-aware which is if we focus the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.930" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">energy on enabling human beings to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.970" end="00:06:15.710" style="s2">fully realized human beings expressing</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:17.750" style="s2">their creative collaboration with each</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.710" end="00:06:21.610" style="s2">other which is non-trivial it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.750" end="00:06:23.810" style="s2">easy thing but if we pull that off then</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.610" end="00:06:27.080" style="s2">you get all the rest for free like our</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.810" end="00:06:29.510" style="s2">everything else starts to flow yes we</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.080" end="00:06:31.190" style="s2">all we all get the genius that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.510" end="00:06:34.010" style="s2">unlocked by humanity getting to live</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.190" end="00:06:35.770" style="s2">their genius yep yeah that&#39;s it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.010" end="00:06:37.820" style="s2">and it&#39;s and again like for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.770" end="00:06:39.409" style="s2">concretely saying and look guys it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.820" end="00:06:40.520" style="s2">like you&#39;ve seen it you know that thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.409" end="00:06:43.610" style="s2">where you move</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.520" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">people living like in cubicles and suits</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.610" end="00:06:49.389" style="s2">to sitting in beanbag chairs to you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:51.560" style="s2">having a whole mix like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.389" end="00:06:53.210" style="s2">plethora of all the different type</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.560" end="00:06:54.710" style="s2">haulage use of humans and where they</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.210" end="00:06:57.020" style="s2">come from like just recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.710" end="00:06:59.300" style="s2">it&#39;s just a matter of just knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.020" end="00:07:01.190" style="s2">and then just creating context that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.300" end="00:07:04.520" style="s2">enables it again there&#39;s non-trivial and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.190" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">and you&#39;re also swimming upstream every</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.520" end="00:07:08.419" style="s2">time you try to do this thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:10.069" style="s2">the rule allow it you keep getting that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.419" end="00:07:11.660" style="s2">answer yeah the rules a lot but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.069" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">really not gonna happen so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.660" end="00:07:16.310" style="s2">be thoughtful yeah and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s ideas I have around that like</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.310" end="00:07:22.669" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain what&#39;s the word like</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:24.259" style="s2">security that comes in the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.669" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">what I&#39;ve envisioned is something we</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.259" end="00:07:28.520" style="s2">will do transparently there is a point</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:30.440" style="s2">where that can absolutely be stopped</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.520" end="00:07:31.789" style="s2">ie someone could kill me right now or</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.440" end="00:07:34.159" style="s2">somebody could you know what I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.789" end="00:07:36.710" style="s2">if there&#39;s 12 of us you can just silence</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.159" end="00:07:38.060" style="s2">or by those people out right 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.710" end="00:07:40.030" style="s2">people and there&#39;s a million people when</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.060" end="00:07:42.830" style="s2">there&#39;s 10 million people and our</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.030" end="00:07:45.289" style="s2">foundation is we have to be transparent</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:46.909" style="s2">we&#39;re running a tech company where</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.289" end="00:07:48.949" style="s2">everybody has access to all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.909" end="00:07:50.389" style="s2">information as default so doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.949" end="00:07:52.849" style="s2">there are some areas maybe where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.389" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">not happening yeah if somebody comes in</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.849" end="00:07:57.800" style="s2">and needs like if we were doing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:59.539" style="s2">credit union thing together we could</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.800" end="00:08:01.659" style="s2">find ways around that much more easily</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.539" end="00:08:04.520" style="s2">than a dozen people or a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.659" end="00:08:06.050" style="s2">because part of it is the people with</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.520" end="00:08:07.009" style="s2">power and money have decided that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.050" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to allow that to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.009" end="00:08:11.090" style="s2">happen and the people who empower the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:12.949" style="s2">people with power and money are us the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.090" end="00:08:14.990" style="s2">99 percent were the ones that give them</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.949" end="00:08:15.800" style="s2">our money we&#39;re the ones who allow them</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.990" end="00:08:18.469" style="s2">to have that power</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.800" end="00:08:21.020" style="s2">so they&#39;re like if we if there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.469" end="00:08:24.740" style="s2">of us there&#39;s basically nothing we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.020" end="00:08:26.180" style="s2">do but we hit there has to be enough of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.740" end="00:08:27.770" style="s2">us right we can break the patent system</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.180" end="00:08:29.539" style="s2">for things especially like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.770" end="00:08:31.880" style="s2">pharmaceutical drugs that are like Iran</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.539" end="00:08:35.240" style="s2">or any what your yeah people are dying</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.880" end="00:08:38.390" style="s2">because of insulin you I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.240" end="00:08:39.560" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna stand for that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.390" end="00:08:42.680" style="s2">these things happen because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.560" end="00:08:44.660" style="s2">informations in a vacuum it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.680" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">know you&#39;re fighting the credit union</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.660" end="00:08:48.260" style="s2">system but the world doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:49.339" style="s2">fighting the credit union system yes all</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.260" end="00:08:51.459" style="s2">right so guys can I share two things</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.339" end="00:08:54.380" style="s2">with you yeah and where I would I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.459" end="00:08:57.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.380" end="00:09:00.230" style="s2">well ultimately my intent is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.080" end="00:09:01.880" style="s2">just to empower you oh and that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.230" end="00:09:04.820" style="s2">seeing kind of two or three ways there</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.880" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">one is to say okay the the work that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.820" end="00:09:11.750" style="s2">did in OG game B there was work that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:15.260" style="s2">done between 2010 and 2013 14 by a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.750" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">pretty good group of people is helpful</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.260" end="00:09:17.780" style="s2">but there&#39;s some good ideas there that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:18.710" style="s2">can maybe just you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.780" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">reinvent the wheel we could just give</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.710" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">them to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.190" end="00:09:26.990" style="s2">second is then getting a deeper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.290" end="00:09:29.390" style="s2">where you are and how we can find ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.990" end="00:09:32.210" style="s2">to bring collaborators into your context</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.390" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">that can hold more and carry the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.210" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">so the thing has more embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:41.780" style="s2">then the third is like that that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.370" end="00:09:44.360" style="s2">of that mysterious third always sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.780" end="00:09:45.650" style="s2">listening to see what can&#39;t really be</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.360" end="00:09:47.150" style="s2">thought through but nonetheless is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.650" end="00:09:49.610" style="s2">actually knocking at the door trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.150" end="00:09:51.050" style="s2">emerge but being opening up the space</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.610" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">and being open and available to listen</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.050" end="00:09:55.810" style="s2">where that is if you use that sound like</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:58.280" style="s2">a nice yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.810" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">space I&#39;ve had to be in by myself is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.280" end="00:10:02.930" style="s2">that constant knocking at the door which</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:06.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily work by yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.930" end="00:10:08.360" style="s2">is also a lot easier by yourself like</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.680" end="00:10:10.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay what is the next piece</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.360" end="00:10:12.110" style="s2">that I&#39;m not getting and then my brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.370" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">crates it and then my brain creates it</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.110" end="00:10:18.980" style="s2">but if we&#39;re not creating it I have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:21.950" style="s2">sell it to people as to emerge through</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.980" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">the group and that is where yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.950" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got it that&#39;s exactly right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:33.020" style="s2">so much it alright so what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:34.670" style="s2">start at is with it feels like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.020" end="00:10:37.390" style="s2">pretty feisty so we can do the feisty</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.670" end="00:10:40.280" style="s2">stuff put this in context that there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.390" end="00:10:42.290" style="s2">the feisty stuff sits in a container or</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.280" end="00:10:44.960" style="s2">in a context of nurturing all right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.290" end="00:10:48.440" style="s2">there&#39;s if things are in the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.960" end="00:10:51.020" style="s2">relationship so the what may sound even</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.440" end="00:10:53.300" style="s2">possibly scary is it is scary but it</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.020" end="00:10:56.740" style="s2">only is you only do it in two contexts</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.300" end="00:10:59.540" style="s2">where there&#39;s actually a really solid I</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.740" end="00:11:01.970" style="s2">think of it as a womb like a really</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.540" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">solid nurturing context and it has your</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.970" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:07.970" style="s2">it&#39;s the Jubilee so this is a technology</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:09.589" style="s2">that we worked</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.970" end="00:11:12.289" style="s2">to figure out how to deal with asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.589" end="00:11:13.609" style="s2">of power so when gaming to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.289" end="00:11:17.029" style="s2">which game a decides that it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.609" end="00:11:21.049" style="s2">actually this is a be nasty the Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.029" end="00:11:23.779" style="s2">is a as far as I can tell and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.049" end="00:11:24.799" style="s2">been a lot of thinking about this a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.779" end="00:11:27.499" style="s2">of instantiating what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.799" end="00:11:31.069" style="s2">talking about we hold the power that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.499" end="00:11:32.929" style="s2">cuts through the various well there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.069" end="00:11:34.989" style="s2">usually with the language and game</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.929" end="00:11:37.609" style="s2">theory call it Nash equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.989" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">no I know a bit about game theory but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.609" end="00:11:41.209" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly what the Nash</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:46.519" style="s2">equilibrium is so the Nash equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.209" end="00:11:49.309" style="s2">is where everybody has made a choice on</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.519" end="00:11:53.899" style="s2">the on the basis of what they see as</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.309" end="00:11:55.789" style="s2">being the possible choices and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.899" end="00:11:57.559" style="s2">will change their choice now that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.789" end="00:11:59.449" style="s2">choice has been made so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.559" end="00:12:00.589" style="s2">like we&#39;ve all kind of like we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.449" end="00:12:03.349" style="s2">ourselves into group into a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.589" end="00:12:04.970" style="s2">bind where we may actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.349" end="00:12:07.579" style="s2">notice that there&#39;s a better better</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.970" end="00:12:09.799" style="s2">thing over there but none of us will go</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.579" end="00:12:12.739" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t make sense for even</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.799" end="00:12:16.519" style="s2">for one two or three of us to go we kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.739" end="00:12:18.079" style="s2">of all have to go but if anybody didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.519" end="00:12:20.089" style="s2">even if one person defects the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.079" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">thing doesn&#39;t work so it&#39;s a your stock</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.089" end="00:12:23.899" style="s2">you&#39;re in it&#39;s and it&#39;s it&#39;s stable it</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:25.369" style="s2">actually is quite stable so from one</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.899" end="00:12:26.419" style="s2">point of view it&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.369" end="00:12:27.619" style="s2">stable state from another point of view</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.419" end="00:12:30.919" style="s2">it&#39;s a bad thing cuz you&#39;re stuck you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.619" end="00:12:33.409" style="s2">can&#39;t change so one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.919" end="00:12:35.509" style="s2">we haven&#39;t been able to execute the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.409" end="00:12:39.459" style="s2">sovereignty that is inherent in us as as</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.509" end="00:12:41.359" style="s2">being is these is a Nash equilibrium and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.459" end="00:12:42.439" style="s2">one of the characteristics of this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.359" end="00:12:44.269" style="s2">for example as a collective action</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.439" end="00:12:46.489" style="s2">problem you know how do you get a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.269" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">of people to do something where if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.489" end="00:12:52.359" style="s2">not enough do it it doesn&#39;t work so</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:58.939" style="s2">here&#39;s the construct you ready so</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.359" end="00:13:04.189" style="s2">there&#39;s four components to it the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.939" end="00:13:06.729" style="s2">component is the the commitment the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.189" end="00:13:09.349" style="s2">second component is the is the oath the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.729" end="00:13:12.970" style="s2">third component is the trigger and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.349" end="00:13:15.109" style="s2">fourth component is the payload so</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.970" end="00:13:19.100" style="s2">they&#39;re all they&#39;re tied and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.109" end="00:13:21.740" style="s2">connect so the commitment is you know I</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.100" end="00:13:24.440" style="s2">Jubilee Briscoe some</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.740" end="00:13:26.660" style="s2">ironically agree I sign up that when</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.440" end="00:13:28.730" style="s2">these things happen I will do these</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.660" end="00:13:30.080" style="s2">things and you should imagine like</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.730" end="00:13:32.540" style="s2">technically you should as a video and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.080" end="00:13:34.490" style="s2">you upload it to a blockchain or</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.540" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">something like that but it&#39;s anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.490" end="00:13:41.540" style="s2">all right it&#39;s sealed it&#39;s encrypted and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:43.490" style="s2">so I will do these things when a million</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.540" end="00:13:45.080" style="s2">other people have signed up you know so</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.490" end="00:13:47.090" style="s2">it&#39;s a kick to sort of like collective</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.080" end="00:13:48.170" style="s2">action problem solution once a critical</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.090" end="00:13:51.080" style="s2">mass of people who have made the</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.490" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">move from anonymous to transparent and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.460" end="00:13:59.060" style="s2">do the I do the thing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:02.450" style="s2">committing to and the thing that I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.060" end="00:14:04.730" style="s2">committing to is a Jubilee which is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.450" end="00:14:07.670" style="s2">say that I will at the moment of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.730" end="00:14:09.530" style="s2">triggering I will no longer pay any</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.200" end="00:14:42.530" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s the best the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.390" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">commitment I&#39;m signing up for that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.530" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what I will do and then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:51.020" style="s2">got the notion of the the trigger and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:52.430" style="s2">can identify the trigger right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.020" end="00:14:54.500" style="s2">there&#39;s many many different constructs</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.430" end="00:14:55.640" style="s2">like different versions of what this</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.500" end="00:14:57.020" style="s2">game looks like the people have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.640" end="00:15:00.020" style="s2">experimenting with what&#39;s the one that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.020" end="00:15:01.370" style="s2">has the most potency to it but we could</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.020" end="00:15:03.380" style="s2">just say a simple trigger is that we say</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.370" end="00:15:08.120" style="s2">when you know a million people have</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.380" end="00:15:09.260" style="s2">signed up we&#39;ll do it or 38 million then</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.120" end="00:15:11.030" style="s2">you have the payload and the payload</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.260" end="00:15:12.950" style="s2">that gets very interesting the payload</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.030" end="00:15:15.500" style="s2">you can actually drop this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.950" end="00:15:18.200" style="s2">nurturing piece gets lit up you can drop</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.500" end="00:15:21.350" style="s2">a lot of other stuff so that the basic</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.200" end="00:15:23.930" style="s2">payload is the Jubilee specific Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.350" end="00:15:24.980" style="s2">commitment that&#39;s like that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.930" end="00:15:26.630" style="s2">of the spear that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.980" end="00:15:28.400" style="s2">activates it but I can put other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.630" end="00:15:31.220" style="s2">in for example I could put in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.400" end="00:15:33.320" style="s2">universal basic income so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.220" end="00:15:35.720" style="s2">things that will happen when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.320" end="00:15:37.550" style="s2">activate the Jubilee is that all fear</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.720" end="00:15:41.389" style="s2">currency will evaporate in the matter of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.550" end="00:15:45.259" style="s2">days for the same reason if what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.389" end="00:15:47.810" style="s2">just talked about banking like something</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.259" end="00:15:49.220" style="s2">like 98% we modeled about 98 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.810" end="00:15:50.810" style="s2">fiat currency and now includes by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.220" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">way China I didn&#39;t at the time it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.810" end="00:15:55.009" style="s2">include time but now includes everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:57.350" style="s2">here in Switzerland will it will</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.009" end="00:15:59.750" style="s2">evaporate within a week well okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.350" end="00:16:01.220" style="s2">problem but what we do is everybody gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.750" end="00:16:02.300" style="s2">fifty thousand dollars in their account</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.220" end="00:16:05.899" style="s2">in new money immediately</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.300" end="00:16:08.449" style="s2">so jubilee we always sign up for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.899" end="00:16:10.189" style="s2">jubilee immediately we issue a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.449" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">people&#39;s currency that is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.189" end="00:16:14.629" style="s2">associated with with the banking system</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:15.769" style="s2">and its fifty thousand dollars in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.629" end="00:16:17.540" style="s2">account of everybody who signs up</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.769" end="00:16:18.949" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s everybody who has an</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.540" end="00:16:22.790" style="s2">account and if you create thing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.949" end="00:16:24.740" style="s2">get renewing and fifteen hundred dollars</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.790" end="00:16:27.439" style="s2">a month in universal basic income which</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.740" end="00:16:30.829" style="s2">will increase by some rate every month</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.439" end="00:16:32.149" style="s2">up until it&#39;s I believe the number that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.829" end="00:16:35.389" style="s2">it looked like we could get it up to was</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.149" end="00:16:39.620" style="s2">eight thousand a month in about fifteen</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.389" end="00:16:41.149" style="s2">years and by the way like stable like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.620" end="00:16:42.589" style="s2">it&#39;s very very it&#39;s not just a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.149" end="00:16:44.209" style="s2">stable it&#39;s the opposite of unstable it</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.589" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">actually makes the system more stable to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.209" end="00:16:49.459" style="s2">do it that way</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:50.959" style="s2">the there are other other payloads the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.459" end="00:16:51.980" style="s2">one that was the most interesting we had</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.959" end="00:16:53.809" style="s2">to do with health care like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.980" end="00:16:56.509" style="s2">actually put health care into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.809" end="00:16:58.309" style="s2">community contact but you get the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.509" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">right there&#39;s a you want to explore</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.309" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a machinery the machinery has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:03.110" style="s2">certain set of characteristics and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:05.089" style="s2">key is they would have dozens that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.110" end="00:17:07.640" style="s2">actually it disrupts the Nash</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.089" end="00:17:10.100" style="s2">equilibrium because it creates it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.640" end="00:17:13.510" style="s2">creates a game Theo theoretic defection</p>

<p begin="00:17:23.990" end="00:17:29.510" style="s2">Jubilee there&#39;s some probability that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.689" end="00:17:31.309" style="s2">will actually come to pass in different</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.510" end="00:17:33.110" style="s2">jurisdictions so maybe it&#39;s more likely</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.309" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">in Argentina and Greece than it is in in</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.110" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">Canada but okay that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.710" style="s2">and what happens is is that as you begin</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:44.870" style="s2">to have to calculate that probability of</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.620" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">exactly but you because the code the</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.220" end="00:21:11.240" style="s2">is in fact exactly at this pivot point</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.320" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">is where the original thing we were</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.240" end="00:21:17.510" style="s2">doing became game B which was I had been</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:19.309" style="s2">assigned a particular task called deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.510" end="00:21:21.799" style="s2">code of doing asking the deep question</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.799" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">I came out came out with was exactly you</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.450" end="00:21:27.350" style="s2">said which was okay this this would</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:28.490" style="s2">definitely work in the sense they would</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.350" end="00:21:30.230" style="s2">definitely rigged the system in fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.490" end="00:21:31.549" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of easy like this well the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.230" end="00:21:33.590" style="s2">game theory is they&#39;re like we could</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.549" end="00:21:36.110" style="s2">probably pull this off ourselves and in</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.590" end="00:21:39.020" style="s2">12 months this is before by the way like</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.110" end="00:21:40.280" style="s2">blockchain existed all really like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.020" end="00:21:41.720" style="s2">consciousness that money was something</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.280" end="00:21:46.059" style="s2">that the people could just decide to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.720" end="00:21:47.990" style="s2">build but if he but if we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.059" end="00:21:51.100" style="s2">context we don&#39;t have actually a thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.990" end="00:21:55.700" style="s2">that can hold that energy and so it will</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.100" end="00:22:00.770" style="s2">Rico here around a kind of a next stage</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.700" end="00:22:04.909" style="s2">of game a and it&#39;ll be a better one in</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.770" end="00:22:06.169" style="s2">just the same way that the the world we</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.909" end="00:22:08.780" style="s2">live in right now is a better world in</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.169" end="00:22:10.669" style="s2">the world of the 13th century but it has</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.780" end="00:22:13.100" style="s2">two really bad negative characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.669" end="00:22:15.740" style="s2">one is it has a very short half-life it</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.100" end="00:22:16.540" style="s2">will accelerate to collapse in probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.740" end="00:22:20.900" style="s2">15 years</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.540" end="00:22:24.520" style="s2">just in Peru hum and to in the meantime</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.900" end="00:22:28.160" style="s2">it will continue to consume complexity</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.520" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">at a hyper accelerated rate so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.160" end="00:22:31.000" style="s2">won&#39;t work but that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:35.090" style="s2">actually not a stable solution</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.000" end="00:22:37.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a be kind of fun because you get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.090" end="00:22:41.110" style="s2">blow things up and that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.220" end="00:22:43.190" style="s2">you know Fight Club was a nice fun movie</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.110" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a stable solution so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.190" end="00:22:48.890" style="s2">have to actually get into thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:50.530" style="s2">game B and so that was that so then we</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.890" end="00:22:54.650" style="s2">started talking looking at the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.530" end="00:22:56.090" style="s2">directionality of what&#39;s the other side</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.650" end="00:22:58.220" style="s2">like what&#39;s what&#39;s on the other side the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.090" end="00:23:01.040" style="s2">Looking Glass which for me was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.220" end="00:23:03.590" style="s2">massive undertaking meaning I had to</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.970" end="00:23:15.890" style="s2">in this conversation is where the rival</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.680" end="00:23:25.910" style="s2">it is that what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.660" end="00:23:27.860" style="s2">true has to do with the leverage and</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.810" end="00:25:44.360" style="s2">somebody who didn&#39;t know how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.830" end="00:25:46.370" style="s2">could use the software to do this to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.360" end="00:25:50.720" style="s2">to do the thing we called them script</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.740" end="00:26:24.680" style="s2">trying to look it up and it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.790" end="00:26:27.260" style="s2">sense all right keep it doesn&#39;t generate</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.260" end="00:26:34.550" style="s2">I think so it&#39;s um science real good</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.820" end="00:26:37.760" style="s2">very powerful and it has the you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.550" end="00:26:43.539" style="s2">the ability to actually change the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.760" end="00:26:48.399" style="s2">genotype in cells quickly</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.539" end="00:26:49.720" style="s2">reliably and predictably and you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.399" end="00:26:51.309" style="s2">actually deliver our desired results</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.720" end="00:26:52.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s like genetic engineering the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.309" end="00:26:55.119" style="s2">they describe genetic engineering back</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.600" end="00:26:57.669" style="s2">in the 80s it&#39;s the actual thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.119" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">believe they&#39;re actually it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.669" end="00:27:01.929" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s been it&#39;s been out now for</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:04.869" style="s2">more than a decade it&#39;s being used can</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.929" end="00:27:07.210" style="s2">they do it alt they can do it in there</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.869" end="00:27:12.879" style="s2">they have been able to do it in in vivo</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.210" end="00:27:14.619" style="s2">so they can do it in living cells they</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.879" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">have not been able to get get it to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.619" end="00:27:22.419" style="s2">it in somatic non stem cells so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:24.309" style="s2">couldn&#39;t give it to you just now but</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.419" end="00:27:25.989" style="s2">they&#39;re working on it right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.309" end="00:27:27.519" style="s2">good reason to believe that it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.989" end="00:27:28.749" style="s2">doable and in fact there&#39;s good reason</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.519" end="00:27:29.830" style="s2">believe the Chinese and MEC actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.749" end="00:27:35.470" style="s2">have done it but they haven&#39;t told me</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.830" end="00:27:38.379" style="s2">about it but even if you&#39;re not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.470" end="00:27:39.909" style="s2">in humans a human adult&#39;s you could say</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.379" end="00:27:44.769" style="s2">for example do it in viruses and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.909" end="00:27:45.249" style="s2">bacteria easily enough and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.769" end="00:27:47.139" style="s2">big deal</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.249" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">I the way of thinking about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.139" end="00:27:52.119" style="s2">the the kinds of German warfare that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:55.359" style="s2">only the United States and the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.119" end="00:27:58.749" style="s2">Union could deliver on in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.359" end="00:28:01.539" style="s2">century will will be available to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.749" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">person with a PhD in biology in about</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.539" end="00:28:07.090" style="s2">five years but a PhD in biology does not</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:09.909" style="s2">deliver the moral wisdom to not kill</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.090" end="00:28:11.259" style="s2">everybody delivers the asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.909" end="00:28:14.710" style="s2">capacity to use it because unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.259" end="00:28:16.299" style="s2">we don&#39;t get how to deal with it so what</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.710" end="00:28:19.899" style="s2">happens is is that when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.299" end="00:28:21.970" style="s2">activate this capacity for creative</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.899" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">collaboration you&#39;re gonna have to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.970" end="00:28:24.369" style="s2">very careful if taking into account the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:26.919" style="s2">negatives that will come with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.369" end="00:28:29.619" style="s2">positives we will get for sure massive</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.919" end="00:28:30.700" style="s2">increases in capacity it has to actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.619" end="00:28:32.889" style="s2">we have to actually be thought about</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.700" end="00:28:36.369" style="s2">building symmetry incompetence or</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.889" end="00:28:37.989" style="s2">symmetry and wisdom with power otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.369" end="00:28:39.999" style="s2">we will in fact for short kill ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.989" end="00:28:43.090" style="s2">because it just takes a few bad actors</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.999" end="00:28:43.979" style="s2">or if you just make mistake yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.090" end="00:28:46.749" style="s2">scary</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.979" end="00:28:49.720" style="s2">yeah so the same see this is a big thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.749" end="00:28:52.029" style="s2">like we spent a like I as somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.720" end="00:28:56.220" style="s2">my background was technology</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.029" end="00:28:57.280" style="s2">entrepreneur had a built-in bias towards</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.280" end="00:29:00.310" style="s2">just do it dick try it it probably fail</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.810" end="00:29:03.910" style="s2">anyway if it works you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.310" end="00:29:06.310" style="s2">awesome it&#39;ll be fun had to like sit</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.910" end="00:29:07.690" style="s2">down and really look through the math</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.310" end="00:29:09.010" style="s2">and look through the logic and realize</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.690" end="00:29:11.020" style="s2">that the proofs to bidding put up were</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.010" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">certain life it wasn&#39;t there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">it is existential it kills everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.680" end="00:29:19.000" style="s2">not that while like less than a decade</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:20.590" style="s2">if you get these triggers right so it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.000" end="00:29:24.580" style="s2">sort of this thing&#39;s like shoot we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.590" end="00:29:26.290" style="s2">actually trigger game B at real scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.580" end="00:29:29.020" style="s2">until we&#39;ve actually figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.290" end="00:29:30.490" style="s2">do it so that people get it&#39;s like a</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.470" end="00:29:44.320" style="s2">I just embodied wisdom just the ability</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.180" end="00:29:46.330" style="s2">to make good choices with the things</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.060" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">thing that is that we know we&#39;ve seen</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.020" end="00:32:08.230" style="s2">there&#39;s systemic stuff that happens</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.440" end="00:33:18.550" style="s2">these two pieces fit nicely that the</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.309" end="00:33:54.110" style="s2">from naming that naming what it means</p>

<p begin="00:34:29.960" end="00:34:35.869" style="s2">interesting step functions like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.379" end="00:34:39.379" style="s2">a linear thing there&#39;s certain things</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.379" end="00:34:44.210" style="s2">of power means that your choice making</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.450" end="00:34:47.270" style="s2">capacity has to be quite high before you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.210" end="00:34:48.710" style="s2">cross into that threshold like I can I</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.270" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be a shoe I would not trust</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">for example that I wouldn&#39;t trust to</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:35:01.490" style="s2">six people who are quite remarkable by</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.990" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">the way it&#39;s quite palpable when you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.490" end="00:35:07.790" style="s2">encounter somebody who is that level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:11.630" style="s2">embodied wisdom mmm-hmm yeah no I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.790" end="00:35:15.020" style="s2">those are all very important factors</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.630" end="00:35:16.460" style="s2">the issue is game a is run by sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.020" end="00:35:19.790" style="s2">and they have the power and they have</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.460" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">the keys and science done behind locked</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.790" end="00:35:24.109" style="s2">doors is not in any way guarantee that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:26.810" style="s2">these things are in place in any way</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.109" end="00:35:29.000" style="s2">shape or form oh no and so collectively</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.810" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">having transparency when I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.000" end="00:35:33.470" style="s2">about transparency I don&#39;t mean crisper</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:35.390" style="s2">transparency I mean transparency in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.470" end="00:35:37.310" style="s2">board of directors of the tech company I</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.390" end="00:35:38.360" style="s2">mean where money comes from and where it</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.310" end="00:35:42.170" style="s2">goes what</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.360" end="00:35:45.460" style="s2">decisions were making to our members</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.170" end="00:35:47.390" style="s2">towards complete sparrin see yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.460" end="00:35:50.360" style="s2">since making it needs to be fully</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.390" end="00:35:52.850" style="s2">transparent and so part of that is I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.360" end="00:35:53.630" style="s2">mean I think a simple version of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.850" end="00:35:56.770" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.630" end="00:36:01.520" style="s2">that is available right now is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.770" end="00:36:02.990" style="s2">debate on gun laws and you know that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.520" end="00:36:04.460" style="s2">need to have stricter gun laws because</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.990" end="00:36:07.250" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.460" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">and although intellectually I support</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.250" end="00:36:14.090" style="s2">that we&#39;re also at a point in technology</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:16.250" style="s2">where you can 3d print a gun and so this</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.090" end="00:36:18.110" style="s2">evolution it in consciousness so people</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.250" end="00:36:20.120" style="s2">don&#39;t want to kill each other you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.110" end="00:36:22.430" style="s2">we have no solution for that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.120" end="00:36:23.990" style="s2">knowing people and putting laws in place</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.430" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">and not dealing with you know mental</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.990" end="00:36:33.290" style="s2">health and and just like our personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:34.910" style="s2">autonomy being hurt chicken bean or a</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.290" end="00:36:38.810" style="s2">group of human beings and we feel that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.910" end="00:36:40.010" style="s2">is where our power lies that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.810" end="00:36:41.270" style="s2">need to be dealing with and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.010" end="00:36:45.380" style="s2">able to deal with that in our current</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.270" end="00:36:48.350" style="s2">system at all and so I&#39;d rather have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.380" end="00:36:51.110" style="s2">system of transparency of you know if</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.350" end="00:36:54.380" style="s2">we&#39;re doing something like voting</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.110" end="00:36:57.110" style="s2">whether to fund a project like CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.380" end="00:37:01.100" style="s2">part of it is inherent in the system is</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.110" end="00:37:02.570" style="s2">looking at what could go wrong what why</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.100" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">would this be positive and why would</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.570" end="00:37:06.170" style="s2">this be negative and we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:08.570" style="s2">throwing out things I mean my background</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.170" end="00:37:11.870" style="s2">is actually in genetics it&#39;s what I have</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.570" end="00:37:14.540" style="s2">my bachelor&#39;s and it&#39;s not PhD but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.870" end="00:37:17.450" style="s2">don&#39;t have to worry about this yet no</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.540" end="00:37:19.430" style="s2">GMOs don&#39;t when they first I was like</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.450" end="00:37:21.380" style="s2">yeah they sound great awesome like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.430" end="00:37:22.970" style="s2">solving all these problems and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.380" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">looking into the science of it I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.970" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">like but we don&#39;t understand it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:28.970" style="s2">you know breaking things into their</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:30.260" style="s2">components putting them out into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.970" end="00:37:33.350" style="s2">world in a way that they can just</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.260" end="00:37:35.420" style="s2">reproduce this is not and it&#39;s done for</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.350" end="00:37:38.030" style="s2">profit right and there you are deciding</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.420" end="00:37:40.430" style="s2">whether it&#39;s ethical and that&#39;s in no</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.030" end="00:37:44.030" style="s2">way a solution and so at least with</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.430" end="00:37:46.130" style="s2">transparent science collectively we</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.030" end="00:37:47.870" style="s2">understand that we don&#39;t want GMOs</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.130" end="00:37:49.460" style="s2">necessarily or at least not GMOs on a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.870" end="00:37:51.890" style="s2">massive scale without them also being</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.460" end="00:37:52.340" style="s2">tested first right like the positive and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.890" end="00:37:53.750" style="s2">the negative</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.340" end="00:37:56.330" style="s2">well we need to feed the masses can we</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.750" end="00:37:58.670" style="s2">feed the masses without GMOs yes can we</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.330" end="00:38:00.860" style="s2">you know can we create GMOs that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.670" end="00:38:03.350" style="s2">require heavy amounts of pesticides or</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.860" end="00:38:05.510" style="s2">don&#39;t kill our guts or don&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.350" end="00:38:07.100" style="s2">involves testing that involves not you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.510" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">know creating massive fields of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.100" end="00:38:13.190" style="s2">because I have a patents on this this</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:15.080" style="s2">genetic material right so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.190" end="00:38:17.630" style="s2">if what I&#39;m talking about solves in any</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.080" end="00:38:19.580" style="s2">way the CRISPR problem or the AI problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.630" end="00:38:21.320" style="s2">because there&#39;s always gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.580" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">possibility of somebody creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.320" end="00:38:26.660" style="s2">something in their garage and not not</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.090" end="00:38:43.250" style="s2">like creating a nuclear bomb here in you</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.250" end="00:38:46.820" style="s2">like certain things that are like these</p>

<p begin="00:39:31.490" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">a race to the bottom game theory meaning</p>

<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:41.500" style="s2">will or whoever most right now is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.170" end="00:39:43.730" style="s2">Chinese in Google who are kind of racing</p>

<p begin="00:39:43.730" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">slow down the whole story much oh cheese</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.180" end="00:39:49.400" style="s2">that we would even do that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:51.710" style="s2">you have to actually build an</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.400" end="00:39:53.210" style="s2">alternative and it&#39;s like okay here&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.710" end="00:39:55.550" style="s2">we can get this thing moving and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.210" end="00:39:58.130" style="s2">actually create a context where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.550" end="00:39:59.630" style="s2">a way for people to as individuals to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.130" end="00:40:01.940" style="s2">attach some things that they know are</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.630" end="00:40:04.460" style="s2">not good and there&#39;s an answer for how</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.940" end="00:40:05.810" style="s2">we can actually get you know people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.460" end="00:40:08.110" style="s2">are mutually pointing guns at each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.810" end="00:40:08.110" style="s2">to put</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.320" end="00:40:13.160" style="s2">then they will like people will actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.460" end="00:40:14.930" style="s2">step into it and so here&#39;s like from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.160" end="00:40:18.200" style="s2">middle out and it feels like you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.930" end="00:40:19.310" style="s2">of that&#39;s where you orient maybe is what</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.200" end="00:40:20.599" style="s2">are the things that we can do now what</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.310" end="00:40:22.790" style="s2">are the kind of low-hanging fruit kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.599" end="00:40:26.270" style="s2">of simple things that we can do now that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.790" end="00:40:28.520" style="s2">are embedding the right whole system in</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.270" end="00:40:30.770" style="s2">the code and that I think is what I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.520" end="00:40:33.859" style="s2">trying to convey is is that as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.770" end="00:40:35.660" style="s2">doing this it&#39;s it&#39;s as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.859" end="00:40:37.150" style="s2">tell quite important to be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.660" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">about the whole system dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.150" end="00:40:45.020" style="s2">doing it from the beginning up so for</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:47.180" style="s2">example how it&#39;s actually the question I</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.020" end="00:40:49.490" style="s2">asked I think on the game B form just to</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.180" end="00:40:51.530" style="s2">me a couple hours ago how do we curate</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.490" end="00:40:53.089" style="s2">game B projects like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.530" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">criteria that would indicate to us that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.089" end="00:40:59.390" style="s2">a given team is the individuals involved</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:41:01.700" style="s2">have done enough to be making good</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.390" end="00:41:05.560" style="s2">choices at least endeavoring to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.700" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">good choices that the project itself is</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.560" end="00:41:09.619" style="s2">you know it&#39;s ask the right questions I</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:10.700" style="s2">think the questions have been asked me</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.619" end="00:41:14.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s being approached in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.700" end="00:41:17.569" style="s2">thoughtful fashion and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.839" end="00:41:20.930" style="s2">that the the project is happening in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.569" end="00:41:24.020" style="s2">context or as part of a vision that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.930" end="00:41:25.670" style="s2">itself in alignment meaning like you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.020" end="00:41:28.430" style="s2">said like you&#39;re what you&#39;re doing is is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.670" end="00:41:30.079" style="s2">not you don&#39;t want to do what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.430" end="00:41:32.210" style="s2">doing and then sell it to people like no</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:34.069" style="s2">no I&#39;m doing this and if I can get other</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.210" end="00:41:36.859" style="s2">people to be doing similar related</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.069" end="00:41:39.980" style="s2">allied things around me there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.859" end="00:41:41.240" style="s2">thing that shifts in the context it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.980" end="00:41:43.010" style="s2">be very it can be something very small</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.240" end="00:41:44.089" style="s2">like it&#39;s like a couple of people say</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.010" end="00:41:46.520" style="s2">hey I want to figure how to build a new</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.089" end="00:41:50.420" style="s2">kind of coffee shop where it&#39;s a co-op</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.520" end="00:41:53.500" style="s2">and so the baristas are actually making</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.420" end="00:41:56.030" style="s2">a better truly income a true lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.500" end="00:41:57.589" style="s2">income out of the economics of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.030" end="00:41:58.550" style="s2">coffee shop you might look at it and say</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.589" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.550" end="00:42:02.030" style="s2">that makes sense I got you thought this</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:03.410" style="s2">through I think the structure you&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.030" end="00:42:05.960" style="s2">in place looks like it could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.410" end="00:42:07.099" style="s2">work and you&#39;re doing it in a context of</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.960" end="00:42:09.500" style="s2">really being able to think about how</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.099" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">this could play a role you know how does</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.500" end="00:42:15.290" style="s2">this thing this new place play a role in</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:16.460" style="s2">you as a meeting ground for their</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.290" end="00:42:17.480" style="s2">community people are coming to this</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.460" end="00:42:20.380" style="s2">coffee shop we&#39;re actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.480" end="00:42:21.849" style="s2">redefine the notion of people having</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.380" end="00:42:23.499" style="s2">say shoots with each other in this place</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.849" end="00:42:25.989" style="s2">and with the tenor of everything like</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.499" end="00:42:27.579" style="s2">the like we we have actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.989" end="00:42:30.700" style="s2">relationships with the growers where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.579" end="00:42:32.259" style="s2">growers are part of the coop there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.700" end="00:42:34.749" style="s2">direct continuity like the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.259" end="00:42:36.609" style="s2">is really okay that&#39;s well thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.749" end="00:42:38.349" style="s2">through it&#39;s part of the fabric of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.609" end="00:42:40.359" style="s2">future that you can see how this is part</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.349" end="00:42:42.670" style="s2">of the pieces can start to connect like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.359" end="00:42:44.650" style="s2">the mesh begins to connect up and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.670" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">individuals who are thinking it they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.650" end="00:42:48.700" style="s2">actually stepped up their high horse</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:50.559" style="s2">they&#39;ve done they&#39;ve become the people</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.700" end="00:42:52.359" style="s2">it&#39;s intended to they&#39;ve done the work</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.559" end="00:42:55.210" style="s2">to at least mostly moving direction</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.359" end="00:42:58.029" style="s2">becoming the people think say okay game</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.210" end="00:42:59.410" style="s2">be project you&#39;re in you&#39;re somehow in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.029" end="00:43:01.869" style="s2">place where we can begin to support you</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.410" end="00:43:04.450" style="s2">in in some fashion you can imagine many</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.869" end="00:43:07.630" style="s2">many different fashions right you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.450" end="00:43:11.140" style="s2">say in the post crypto World Cup game be</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.630" end="00:43:13.089" style="s2">currency and you may have very simple</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.140" end="00:43:14.680" style="s2">like a co-op that is a medic co-op and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.089" end="00:43:17.140" style="s2">one of the characteristics is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.680" end="00:43:19.180" style="s2">everybody who joins the medic coop buys</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.140" end="00:43:24.430" style="s2">game be currency so it begins to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.180" end="00:43:27.309" style="s2">value and they endeavour to work with</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.430" end="00:43:30.369" style="s2">and interact with and part and buy from</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.369" end="00:43:33.069" style="s2">have been selected this sort of hit the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:34.599" style="s2">criteria and we even have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.069" end="00:43:35.890" style="s2">different stages so I can come in not</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.599" end="00:43:38.469" style="s2">quite know what I&#39;m doing them stage one</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.890" end="00:43:39.729" style="s2">and if I like work with Joe certain</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.469" end="00:43:43.660" style="s2">people and upgrade what I&#39;m doing I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.729" end="00:43:46.390" style="s2">become say Stage five and resources can</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.660" end="00:43:50.200" style="s2">flow in that context why go there sorry</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.210" end="00:43:59.529" style="s2">this is like where I&#39;m starting because</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.950" end="00:44:02.200" style="s2">it&#39;s been my capacity and it&#39;s essential</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.529" end="00:44:03.849" style="s2">for any project we create together and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.200" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">think it can also be used in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.849" end="00:44:08.170" style="s2">space and I&#39;m kind of working on it with</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:10.979" style="s2">Philip and Christian to see about</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.170" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">implementing it on this I knew that</p>

<p begin="00:44:27.219" end="00:44:30.729" style="s2">was amazing for the first week because</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.559" end="00:44:33.829" style="s2">you&#39;d go in and have these amazing</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.729" end="00:44:35.269" style="s2">conversations and then the energy</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.829" end="00:44:36.559" style="s2">hated because you&#39;d go in and there</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.269" end="00:44:37.940" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be people there so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.559" end="00:44:39.890" style="s2">wait for a couple hours and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.940" end="00:44:43.489" style="s2">someone who join you right so it needed</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.890" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">it needs context it needs a timeline and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.489" end="00:44:49.219" style="s2">his schedule to make it function and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">have those conversations yep and that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.219" end="00:44:55.430" style="s2">what I&#39;m proposing is I came across this</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:57.739" style="s2">concept called the World Cafe in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.430" end="00:45:00.469" style="s2">springtime do you know what a cafe is I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.739" end="00:45:04.339" style="s2">do and so I am looking to create a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.469" end="00:45:06.469" style="s2">platform around that method that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.339" end="00:45:08.660" style="s2">for necessarily game B it&#39;s for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.469" end="00:45:10.910" style="s2">to come and have a conversation around a</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.660" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">meaningful question with the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.910" end="00:45:17.569" style="s2">of users made so in the beginning people</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:20.599" style="s2">there&#39;s one quite you&#39;re not asking</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.569" end="00:45:22.549" style="s2">infinite questions but as the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.599" end="00:45:24.950" style="s2">builds were able to focus on more niche</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.549" end="00:45:26.900" style="s2">areas but the idea is a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.950" end="00:45:29.690" style="s2">happens on regular social media which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.900" end="00:45:30.950" style="s2">this division and this debate and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.690" end="00:45:32.299" style="s2">of trolling because you never see</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.950" end="00:45:35.329" style="s2">someone face-to-face and you never</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.299" end="00:45:37.219" style="s2">connect with their their energy and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.329" end="00:45:38.839" style="s2">you know this platform down where I you</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.219" end="00:45:41.690" style="s2">know the president&#39;s tweeting out to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.839" end="00:45:44.809" style="s2">millions of people you know like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.690" end="00:45:46.309" style="s2">that what&#39;s the word influencer right</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.809" end="00:45:48.559" style="s2">like you have a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.309" end="00:45:50.749" style="s2">subscribers so you have more say than</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.559" end="00:45:52.279" style="s2">somebody else not based on your idea not</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.749" end="00:45:55.069" style="s2">based on the merit of what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.279" end="00:45:56.920" style="s2">just because you&#39;re you because you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.069" end="00:45:59.329" style="s2">some kind of celebrity Ness to you and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.920" end="00:46:00.739" style="s2">or you got on the technology right away</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.329" end="00:46:02.690" style="s2">where that&#39;s always seems to be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.739" end="00:46:06.349" style="s2">easier to gain to gain those that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.690" end="00:46:07.609" style="s2">advantage so anyone can come on say when</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.349" end="00:46:09.349" style="s2">they&#39;re available in a 24 hour period</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.609" end="00:46:10.849" style="s2">and on the half an hour marks they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.349" end="00:46:12.440" style="s2">matched with three to four other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.849" end="00:46:14.059" style="s2">to have a conversation and they can have</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.440" end="00:46:16.130" style="s2">one conversation they can have 20</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.059" end="00:46:17.569" style="s2">conversations in a row and in that way</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.130" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">the larger group is also able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.569" end="00:46:25.369" style="s2">conversation sorry this is really good</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:27.650" style="s2">this is a great idea and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.369" end="00:46:29.479" style="s2">by the way this is a game B idea yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.650" end="00:46:30.859" style="s2">yeah and I think the content doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.479" end="00:46:34.999" style="s2">have to be something that&#39;s ostensible</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.859" end="00:46:36.739" style="s2">game being yes no no absolutely so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.999" end="00:46:38.209" style="s2">don&#39;t have the ability to create a such</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.739" end="00:46:39.739" style="s2">a platform and I don&#39;t even know if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.209" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">should until we have the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.739" end="00:46:44.180" style="s2">people to financially back it and just</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:45.410" style="s2">like passionately back in right like yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.180" end="00:46:46.930" style="s2">I want to be on that having those</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.410" end="00:46:49.150" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.930" end="00:46:52.089" style="s2">I think there is that energy and game be</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.150" end="00:46:53.500" style="s2">based on the coffee shop and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.089" end="00:46:56.109" style="s2">the issue is you don&#39;t know when people</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.500" end="00:46:57.730" style="s2">are gonna be there you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.109" end="00:46:58.990" style="s2">conversations to have because sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.730" end="00:46:59.950" style="s2">you&#39;re part of a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.990" end="00:47:02.500" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;re not part of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.950" end="00:47:04.059" style="s2">conversation that might move game be</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.500" end="00:47:05.500" style="s2">forward right you&#39;re like no I want it</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.059" end="00:47:07.990" style="s2">to be part of that I wanted to decide on</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.500" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">the values together I wanted to so</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.990" end="00:47:13.809" style="s2">having what I&#39;ve proposed is having six</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:16.809" style="s2">time slots in a 24 hour period so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.809" end="00:47:19.569" style="s2">one of them works for you and actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.809" end="00:47:21.400" style="s2">asking one question every 48 hours and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.569" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">then on the third day harvesting those</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.400" end="00:47:24.460" style="s2">conversations to say what were the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:26.470" style="s2">common things what are some things we</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.460" end="00:47:28.150" style="s2">can glean and put together doing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.470" end="00:47:30.460" style="s2">twice in a weeks period and then on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.150" end="00:47:37.420" style="s2">seventh day we generate new questions</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.460" end="00:47:39.010" style="s2">and vote on which to work sorry on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.420" end="00:47:40.270" style="s2">seventh day you rest yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.010" end="00:47:41.770" style="s2">literally what I&#39;ve been saying I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.270" end="00:47:43.420" style="s2">and on the seventh day we&#39;ve rest I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.770" end="00:47:47.829" style="s2">like all right we actually generate new</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.420" end="00:47:53.740" style="s2">question that&#39;s really neat that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.829" end="00:47:56.559" style="s2">really it&#39;s not always clear exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.740" end="00:47:58.059" style="s2">what the nature of reality is I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.559" end="00:48:00.339" style="s2">wondering over the past couple of days</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.059" end="00:48:02.319" style="s2">of why I chose to create that Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.339" end="00:48:05.170" style="s2">thing that I did recently did you see</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.319" end="00:48:08.970" style="s2">that which Facebook thing if you go to</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.170" end="00:48:12.700" style="s2">my what&#39;s it called board or my page</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.970" end="00:48:15.369" style="s2">then my personal identity on Facebook I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.700" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">think two days ago here let me read it</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.369" end="00:48:22.210" style="s2">to you it&#39;s not very long it&#39;ll be easy</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:25.000" style="s2">to easy to grasp so September 24th at</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.210" end="00:48:27.069" style="s2">9:30 a.m. so is that yesterday two days</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.000" end="00:48:29.799" style="s2">ago okay so this is what I said</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.069" end="00:48:31.210" style="s2">yesterday a notion came to me it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.799" end="00:48:33.819" style="s2">like it might be interesting to try an</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.210" end="00:48:35.859" style="s2">experiment in collaborative inquiry so</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.819" end="00:48:38.440" style="s2">this is an invitation I see it working</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.859" end="00:48:41.650" style="s2">more or less like this first people</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.440" end="00:48:43.240" style="s2">endeavoring to present ask the questions</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.650" end="00:48:45.700" style="s2">that are quote unquote right ones to ask</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.240" end="00:48:47.890" style="s2">right now the most meaningful question</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.700" end="00:48:49.240" style="s2">at this moment since we&#39;re on Facebook I</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.890" end="00:48:51.069" style="s2">imagine this is taking place in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.240" end="00:48:52.930" style="s2">comments to this post perhaps is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.069" end="00:48:56.170" style="s2">simple protocol each distinct question</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.930" end="00:48:58.390" style="s2">should be its own thread second people</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.170" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">endeavoring to further clarify or deepen</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.390" end="00:49:02.680" style="s2">the inquiry this might show up as</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:04.900" style="s2">asking questions about or in the context</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.680" end="00:49:07.029" style="s2">of questions for example as replies to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.900" end="00:49:08.859" style="s2">given comment it makes sure if simply as</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.029" end="00:49:11.289" style="s2">likes to questions or furthering to help</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.859" end="00:49:12.910" style="s2">orient attention my guess is that this</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.289" end="00:49:14.740" style="s2">piece of the experiment take 2-3 days so</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.910" end="00:49:16.299" style="s2">that may not be the case but it actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.740" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">kind of looks like it is can you so hear</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.299" end="00:49:22.029" style="s2">me yep sweet third finally people at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:23.859" style="s2">very least me might choose to endeavour</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.029" end="00:49:25.539" style="s2">to contemplate some question or</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.859" end="00:49:28.450" style="s2">questions and write a longer form post</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.539" end="00:49:30.430" style="s2">as a result of that contemplation this</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.450" end="00:49:32.410" style="s2">likely takes place on Facebook since</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.430" end="00:49:33.849" style="s2">longer formative of bust here and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.410" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">will be linked back to this post in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.849" end="00:49:37.630" style="s2">comments this might take at least a week</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:39.039" style="s2">and maybe much longer</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.630" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">contemplation isn&#39;t a straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.039" end="00:49:42.609" style="s2">thing in my experience then finally</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:44.380" style="s2">doing it again maybe two or three times</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.609" end="00:49:46.180" style="s2">to see how the overall competence in</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.380" end="00:49:50.380" style="s2">collaborative inquiry develops over</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.180" end="00:49:53.200" style="s2">iteration and so that was that thing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.380" end="00:49:57.160" style="s2">it has produced a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.200" end="00:50:00.819" style="s2">really good questions like 90 something</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.160" end="00:50:03.490" style="s2">like that a lot of people happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.819" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">where are you have too many tabs I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.490" end="00:50:09.400" style="s2">lost you there we go okay and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:11.470" style="s2">quite sure where that idea came from</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.400" end="00:50:12.970" style="s2">I was just sitting there and also the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.470" end="00:50:15.099" style="s2">idea was in my head more or less fully</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.970" end="00:50:16.569" style="s2">formed and it had a strong amount of</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.099" end="00:50:18.279" style="s2">energy around it so I had to I had to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.569" end="00:50:19.420" style="s2">express it even though makes a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.279" end="00:50:21.609" style="s2">bit uncomfortable to do something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.420" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">that so perhaps it was actually your</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.609" end="00:50:26.200" style="s2">idea and I apologize but perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:28.299" style="s2">useful because now there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.200" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">people who were kind of primed to play</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.299" end="00:50:30.549" style="s2">this kind of game and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:32.680" style="s2">questions that are already out there</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.549" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">with proceeding of which one&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.680" end="00:50:37.539" style="s2">lanta so it could be a very very easy</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:39.819" style="s2">thing to say hey Jubilee is kicking off</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.539" end="00:50:41.170" style="s2">this project already we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.819" end="00:50:44.619" style="s2">having these conversations in person</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.170" end="00:50:45.130" style="s2">anybody you know Mike great over there</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.619" end="00:50:47.859" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.130" end="00:50:49.239" style="s2">get off my Facebook page and it&#39;s phase</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.859" end="00:50:50.849" style="s2">you know the next phase of this thing or</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.239" end="00:50:53.710" style="s2">the branch of this thing is beginning</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.849" end="00:50:57.249" style="s2">like that could be very not just easy</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.710" end="00:51:00.940" style="s2">but frankly it&#39;s been helpful for me and</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.249" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">would be enjoyable I think to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.940" end="00:51:06.279" style="s2">the conversations because I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.559" end="00:51:09.940" style="s2">a big part of to me game B needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.279" end="00:51:13.730" style="s2">is it has to be fun to play for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.940" end="00:51:15.320" style="s2">individual and simple enough that mo</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.730" end="00:51:17.240" style="s2">people can participate and the way to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.320" end="00:51:19.910" style="s2">generate the questions is to make them</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.240" end="00:51:22.910" style="s2">in a way that anybody could answer them</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.910" end="00:51:25.910" style="s2">and nobody has the exact answer at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.910" end="00:51:28.190" style="s2">in the beginning we were exploring yep</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.910" end="00:51:31.070" style="s2">and so there&#39;s two things that I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.190" end="00:51:34.010" style="s2">add to that and there&#39;s been pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.070" end="00:51:37.790" style="s2">decent of experimentation around this</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.010" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">particular question of inquiry so one is</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.790" end="00:51:42.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s actually quite an</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:46.910" style="s2">interesting and useful constraint to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.260" end="00:51:49.430" style="s2">require the inquiry deepen before it</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.910" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">stopped being an inquiry by which I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.430" end="00:51:53.240" style="s2">we could only ask more questions like</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:55.850" style="s2">literally as a constraint for the first</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.240" end="00:51:57.080" style="s2">30 minutes of this call you cannot say</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.850" end="00:51:59.270" style="s2">anything that doesn&#39;t end in a question</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.080" end="00:52:02.030" style="s2">mark you can&#39;t just do the raise your</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.270" end="00:52:03.590" style="s2">voice at the end of your sentence</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.030" end="00:52:04.550" style="s2">what&#39;s the deeper question what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.590" end="00:52:06.290" style="s2">deeper question what&#39;s the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.550" end="00:52:09.560" style="s2">question there&#39;s something about what</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.290" end="00:52:11.930" style="s2">that does to the mind that meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.560" end="00:52:14.030" style="s2">increases people&#39;s capacity to be truly</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.930" end="00:52:15.980" style="s2">in inquiry like truly curious like if</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.030" end="00:52:18.080" style="s2">you just force people to ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.980" end="00:52:20.150" style="s2">for a while their mind shifts into a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.080" end="00:52:23.210" style="s2">curiosity disposition then then when</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.150" end="00:52:26.109" style="s2">they enter and when they exit that right</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.210" end="00:52:28.970" style="s2">they&#39;re still curious and not dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.109" end="00:52:30.200" style="s2">the second piece is a rotten apple can</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.970" end="00:52:34.310" style="s2">spoil the whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.200" end="00:52:37.310" style="s2">it&#39;s you know most people are not very</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.310" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">well trained frankly on how to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.310" end="00:52:47.840" style="s2">be in real dialogue with other people</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:50.930" style="s2">how to listen how to be curious many</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.840" end="00:52:53.660" style="s2">people default to a certain even as I</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.930" end="00:52:55.880" style="s2">did in our call desire to express things</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.660" end="00:52:59.780" style="s2">that they have inside them because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.880" end="00:53:02.330" style="s2">done if it&#39;s really heard and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.780" end="00:53:04.369" style="s2">really just two solutions to that one is</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.330" end="00:53:05.420" style="s2">structural like the one I just gave in</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.369" end="00:53:06.890" style="s2">terms you could just have constraints</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.420" end="00:53:10.220" style="s2">and say ask questions first for the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.890" end="00:53:11.960" style="s2">first hour or have a facilitator who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.220" end="00:53:14.780" style="s2">moderating and managing the human</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.960" end="00:53:19.460" style="s2">dynamics that are going on or you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.780" end="00:53:22.210" style="s2">to have some kind of filter where people</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.460" end="00:53:24.670" style="s2">who just aren&#39;t capable of really</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.210" end="00:53:26.730" style="s2">participating in the culture things</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.670" end="00:53:30.869" style="s2">aren&#39;t there like there</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.730" end="00:53:32.970" style="s2">there they&#39;re not not empowered to</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.869" end="00:53:34.560" style="s2">disrupt and it&#39;s for real like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.970" end="00:53:37.950" style="s2">just it shows up constantly and any any</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.560" end="00:53:39.180" style="s2">effort to do this kind of thing meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.950" end="00:53:41.010" style="s2">things like even if you have even if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.180" end="00:53:42.780" style="s2">have meaningful facilitators it can</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.010" end="00:53:44.869" style="s2">still be challenging so I sent you two</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.780" end="00:53:47.130" style="s2">things on Facebook one of which is my</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.869" end="00:53:49.710" style="s2">documents on what I was talking about on</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.130" end="00:53:51.450" style="s2">a communication platform with game B</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.710" end="00:53:53.850" style="s2">specifically of like how it could work</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.450" end="00:53:56.130" style="s2">the other one is I actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.850" end="00:53:58.020" style="s2">youtube channel that I&#39;m using for what</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.130" end="00:54:00.270" style="s2">I&#39;m calling the idea Cafe which is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.020" end="00:54:04.170" style="s2">platform for having a collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.270" end="00:54:06.570" style="s2">conversation that at least in essence</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.170" end="00:54:08.100" style="s2">works because it&#39;s a YouTube channel so</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.570" end="00:54:09.720" style="s2">like we&#39;re doing it live and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.100" end="00:54:11.070" style="s2">lot of like vulnerability that goes with</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.720" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">that that isn&#39;t going to be accessible</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.070" end="00:54:15.150" style="s2">to everyone but the point will be and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:16.619" style="s2">we&#39;ll be using zoom or other existing</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.150" end="00:54:19.050" style="s2">technology so we don&#39;t have to recreate</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.619" end="00:54:20.850" style="s2">the wheel just like connecting people to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.050" end="00:54:25.950" style="s2">those zoom calls once we have our you</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.850" end="00:54:27.330" style="s2">know preliminary beta platform but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.950" end="00:54:29.369" style="s2">looking at the structure of one</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.330" end="00:54:31.800" style="s2">conversation so it&#39;s like three to five</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.369" end="00:54:33.000" style="s2">people you each take turns answering the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.800" end="00:54:35.460" style="s2">questions so one person isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.000" end="00:54:38.369" style="s2">monopolizing the time and even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.460" end="00:54:40.200" style="s2">you know coming from a space of anger if</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.369" end="00:54:42.450" style="s2">projected at the people there you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.200" end="00:54:44.160" style="s2">still like done at the end of five</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.450" end="00:54:46.470" style="s2">minutes and that&#39;s still an experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:48.450" style="s2">that the group has the other amazing</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.470" end="00:54:52.800" style="s2">aspect of breaking off into these</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.450" end="00:54:54.900" style="s2">smaller groups is that you can&#39;t derail</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.800" end="00:54:57.660" style="s2">the entire conversation you can only</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.900" end="00:55:00.450" style="s2">derail a tiny conversation that is P a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.660" end="00:55:02.520" style="s2">piece of the bigger hole so it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.450" end="00:55:05.850" style="s2">harder for one person to monopolize at</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.520" end="00:55:08.040" style="s2">all or one energy to take you know like</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.850" end="00:55:09.600" style="s2">even if you&#39;re going to monopolize the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.040" end="00:55:13.020" style="s2">conversation and not follow the rules</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.600" end="00:55:15.780" style="s2">and not listen for understanding you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.020" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">only reckon verse a ssin and yeah he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.780" end="00:55:19.290" style="s2">truly wrecking it when then that group</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:21.150" style="s2">gets to learn from that experience be</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.290" end="00:55:22.940" style="s2">like we don&#39;t like that how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.150" end="00:55:25.320" style="s2">mitigate against that in the future</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.940" end="00:55:27.030" style="s2">possibly asking the person who did it</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.320" end="00:55:28.380" style="s2">right what because I know I interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.030" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">people and sometimes monopolize the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.380" end="00:55:33.510" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s why I like defining</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:35.210" style="s2">like I know I have five minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.510" end="00:55:37.080" style="s2">answer the question that&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.210" end="00:55:39.150" style="s2">boundary that I am comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.080" end="00:55:40.380" style="s2">versus even if I&#39;m not done at the end</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.150" end="00:55:41.549" style="s2">of five minutes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.380" end="00:55:44.130" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s good there&#39;s a great because</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.549" end="00:55:46.349" style="s2">we&#39;re eight structural elements so and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.130" end="00:55:47.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a interesting as you say that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.349" end="00:55:50.430" style="s2">could my assumption my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.700" end="00:55:52.109" style="s2">you&#39;re proposing is there&#39;s an iterative</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.430" end="00:55:54.150" style="s2">learning process where as you go into</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.109" end="00:55:56.309" style="s2">I&#39;m part of a conversation it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.150" end="00:55:58.349" style="s2">conversation is destroyed the invitation</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.309" end="00:56:00.900" style="s2">is to say hey what&#39;s the feedback that</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.349" end="00:56:03.210" style="s2">you might have on how to improve this</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.900" end="00:56:04.499" style="s2">process so that I&#39;m not disempowered and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.210" end="00:56:06.989" style="s2">basically just say these guys I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.499" end="00:56:08.220" style="s2">out of here but actually man I really</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.989" end="00:56:10.380" style="s2">wanted to have a good conversation if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.220" end="00:56:14.519" style="s2">can find some way to solve it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.380" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">familiar with open space not I no open</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.519" end="00:56:19.799" style="s2">source I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know if in</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:24.150" style="s2">space so World Cafe is one process</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.799" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">there&#39;s as many maybe maybe 50 open</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.150" end="00:56:29.339" style="s2">space is another that&#39;s quite well</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:31.349" style="s2">understood and good and it&#39;s cross</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.339" end="00:56:32.609" style="s2">fertilization can be dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.349" end="00:56:34.619" style="s2">facilitation that might also be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.609" end="00:56:35.700" style="s2">and frankly some of the innovators like</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.619" end="00:56:37.710" style="s2">literally the people who invented these</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.700" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">processes are on that Facebook threads</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.710" end="00:56:44.940" style="s2">that I created for example an open space</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:48.119" style="s2">happens is pretty similar action there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.940" end="00:56:50.039" style="s2">a question and the phrase they say is</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.119" end="00:56:51.180" style="s2">whoever shows up or the ones who are</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.039" end="00:56:52.410" style="s2">supposed to be there there was an</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.180" end="00:56:54.630" style="s2">invitation here&#39;s a question here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.410" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">invitation show if you want that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.630" end="00:56:57.029" style="s2">really actually very helpful filter if</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:56:58.349" style="s2">it&#39;s not if it&#39;s in a compelling</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.029" end="00:57:01.410" style="s2">question you just don&#39;t show up cool</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.349" end="00:57:03.329" style="s2">then it and then people are spread out</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.410" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">into rooms like you sort of randomly</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.329" end="00:57:08.400" style="s2">move people into small group</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:11.579" style="s2">conversations and the rule of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.400" end="00:57:13.799" style="s2">conversation is vote with your feet so</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.579" end="00:57:15.690" style="s2">you are not in open space you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.799" end="00:57:17.489" style="s2">obligated to stay in the room you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.690" end="00:57:19.319" style="s2">leave the room and go back to the common</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.489" end="00:57:22.739" style="s2">area you can&#39;t go to another room you</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.319" end="00:57:25.049" style="s2">can go to the common area and so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.739" end="00:57:26.579" style="s2">know if I if I am in a station with five</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.049" end="00:57:28.589" style="s2">people one person is monopolizing the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.579" end="00:57:30.329" style="s2">conversation I can just leave and as it</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.589" end="00:57:32.460" style="s2">turns out social signaling is very</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.329" end="00:57:33.569" style="s2">powerful if I&#39;m in operating the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.460" end="00:57:35.160" style="s2">conversation literally everybody just</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.569" end="00:57:36.239" style="s2">gets up and leaves I kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.160" end="00:57:38.309" style="s2">learned something very deep and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.239" end="00:57:39.329" style="s2">fundamental I mean it you know figured</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.309" end="00:57:41.279" style="s2">out how to solve the problem but I know</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.329" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem and then those people</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.279" end="00:57:45.029" style="s2">can go back to the common area and once</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:46.739" style="s2">there&#39;s a critical mass of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.029" end="00:57:49.829" style="s2">common area they can form a new group</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.739" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">and the flow of people go in and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.829" end="00:57:54.270" style="s2">kind of say okay it&#39;s going to be 30</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">minutes in each room and people flow</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.270" end="00:57:57.930" style="s2">and you get this really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:58:00.750" style="s2">organic movement and over a period of</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.930" end="00:58:03.960" style="s2">time the question gets very very richly</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.750" end="00:58:06.330" style="s2">considered I know some people who are</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.960" end="00:58:07.380" style="s2">just flat-out experts in that dynamic if</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.330" end="00:58:10.050" style="s2">you&#39;d be interested in chatting with</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.380" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">them and I think they&#39;re pretty generous</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.050" end="00:58:14.430" style="s2">of spirit so they&#39;d be willing to share</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:16.260" style="s2">what they know absolutely interested in</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.430" end="00:58:18.810" style="s2">chatting with them I love that idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.260" end="00:58:21.030" style="s2">one of my friends Daniel introduced me a</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.810" end="00:58:22.770" style="s2">little bit like that in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.030" end="00:58:24.480" style="s2">space I think he called it circles which</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.770" end="00:58:27.120" style="s2">is not like circling that the game be</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.480" end="00:58:28.680" style="s2">talks about but I love that idea I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.120" end="00:58:30.600" style="s2">know how it would work on a platform</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.680" end="00:58:32.520" style="s2">where it&#39;s like the global the World</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.600" end="00:58:36.060" style="s2">Cafe I know more like having one</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.520" end="00:58:37.680" style="s2">question for a 24-hour period but</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.060" end="00:58:41.460" style="s2">playing with that and seeing what we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.680" end="00:58:44.850" style="s2">create together because the World Cafe</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.460" end="00:58:47.520" style="s2">could be done on Zoom and a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.850" end="00:58:48.750" style="s2">platform and then saying you know as I</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.520" end="00:58:50.340" style="s2">was thinking more breaking off into like</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.750" end="00:58:52.770" style="s2">the climate change group has a question</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.340" end="00:58:54.060" style="s2">for the day but having it so anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.770" end="00:58:55.950" style="s2">generate a question and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.060" end="00:58:57.600" style="s2">the people who are interested in it I</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.950" end="00:59:00.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know how that works with time</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.600" end="00:59:03.240" style="s2">zones as part of it is having a global</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.240" end="00:59:05.070" style="s2">conversation you&#39;re saying I&#39;m available</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.240" end="00:59:07.320" style="s2">at this time for this question but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.070" end="00:59:10.110" style="s2">you could create it like I have said for</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.320" end="00:59:11.730" style="s2">six different time slots and form it</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.110" end="00:59:13.020" style="s2">around that and so it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.730" end="00:59:15.090" style="s2">idea for the platform was it was going</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.020" end="00:59:16.590" style="s2">to be 24/7 but how do you get the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.090" end="00:59:18.120" style="s2">threshold of people there to make that</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.590" end="00:59:19.980" style="s2">interesting conversation so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.120" end="00:59:22.500" style="s2">breaking off into groups and then this</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.980" end="00:59:25.320" style="s2">idea showed up if like well that for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.500" end="00:59:27.810" style="s2">global population one of these time</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.320" end="00:59:29.400" style="s2">periods is gonna work for you and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.810" end="00:59:32.870" style="s2">know you have 48 hours to come on for</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.400" end="00:59:36.540" style="s2">one by the way I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.870" end="00:59:41.300" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a formal rule around</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.540" end="00:59:44.430" style="s2">what you did there and 24 24 to 6 shoot</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.300" end="00:59:46.620" style="s2">think of it maybe you know you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.430" end="00:59:49.260" style="s2">design of this sort it&#39;s useful to</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.620" end="00:59:51.420" style="s2">actually be able to do meta design just</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.260" end="00:59:54.030" style="s2">to have an understanding of what are the</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.420" end="00:59:57.769" style="s2">kinds of moves they can resolve category</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.030" end="01:00:01.529" style="s2">problems what is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.769" end="01:00:03.750" style="s2">nature does this a lot ah shoot and well</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.529" end="01:00:05.700" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.750" end="01:00:10.859" style="s2">about that like partitioning a an</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.700" end="01:00:14.490" style="s2">analogue space 24 hours into a set of</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.859" end="01:00:17.940" style="s2">smaller spaces that renormalize is you</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.490" end="01:00:21.150" style="s2">can get the criticality to hit in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.940" end="01:00:23.539" style="s2">in the slots yeah so I mean it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.150" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">me like the the key is just to have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.539" end="01:00:32.009" style="s2">learning begin to play find a way to put</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">people who are energized skillful people</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.009" end="01:00:35.160" style="s2">in to do it there&#39;s a lot of cool folks</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.839" end="01:00:38.279" style="s2">I did you know Joe Edelman steam and</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.160" end="01:00:40.650" style="s2">burn at Berlin no good heavens man</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.279" end="01:00:44.670" style="s2">they&#39;re amazing and crazy but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.650" end="01:00:46.140" style="s2">gonna do and he was rubber gee he was</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.670" end="01:00:47.970" style="s2">actually part of the original game be</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.140" end="01:00:49.319" style="s2">and went off into his clown world and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.970" end="01:00:52.759" style="s2">don&#39;t mean that in any sort of negative</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.319" end="01:00:55.920" style="s2">sense I mean I quit early actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.759" end="01:01:00.420" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a whole universe now of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.920" end="01:01:02.099" style="s2">games that they play in active play like</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.420" end="01:01:04.799" style="s2">one of them is to say it&#39;s like a values</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.099" end="01:01:07.589" style="s2">game game one is a game where you learn</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:08.990" style="s2">how learning cure values are like one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.589" end="01:01:12.480" style="s2">my by is to say tell the truth or</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.990" end="01:01:14.220" style="s2">respect other people and so that game</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.480" end="01:01:16.529" style="s2">kind of gets that surfaced the second</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.220" end="01:01:19.259" style="s2">game is an active play where for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.529" end="01:01:21.480" style="s2">period of time I had to consciously do</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.259" end="01:01:23.369" style="s2">the exact opposite of the things that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.480" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">thought were my explicit values so I</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.369" end="01:01:26.430" style="s2">have to lie just lie lie lie I have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:29.339" style="s2">be rude rude as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.430" end="01:01:30.630" style="s2">right and this thing happens where you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.339" end="01:01:32.279" style="s2">actually begin to realize oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.630" end="01:01:33.599" style="s2">that actually wasn&#39;t my value like my</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.279" end="01:01:36.599" style="s2">value is actually something deeper and</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.599" end="01:01:38.069" style="s2">slightly different but locked into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.599" end="01:01:41.339" style="s2">box I didn&#39;t think about it live like</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.069" end="01:01:42.359" style="s2">they did maybe 300 games and a very</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.339" end="01:01:45.509" style="s2">thoughtful about the notion of how a</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.359" end="01:01:48.059" style="s2">ludic behavior how playfulness opens up</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.509" end="01:01:50.430" style="s2">capacities actually having a</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.059" end="01:01:51.720" style="s2">conversation with two of them next week</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.430" end="01:01:54.029" style="s2">and you can imagine a</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.720" end="01:01:55.559" style="s2">cross-fertilization whereas the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.029" end="01:01:57.000" style="s2">conversation if two or three of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.559" end="01:01:58.200" style="s2">people from that group get involved in</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.000" end="01:01:59.849" style="s2">the creative process the creative</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.200" end="01:02:02.430" style="s2">collaboration of you&#39;re calling a World</p>

<p begin="01:02:15.650" end="01:02:20.850" style="s2">Vanessa my wife studied that whole area</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.870" end="01:02:23.820" style="s2">for a little while to get a handle on it</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.850" end="01:02:25.320" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re kmv players we met in that</p>

<p begin="01:03:01.200" end="01:03:07.620" style="s2">something that will be fun there will be</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.030" end="01:03:09.990" style="s2">I imagine that it has real potential and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.620" end="01:03:12.990" style="s2">even if if it if Peters out it will have</p>
