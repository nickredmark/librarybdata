<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:08.880" style="s2">today I&#39;m going to talk about one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.399" end="00:00:13.080" style="s2">touchy subjects in the modern world and</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.880" end="00:00:20.570" style="s2">that is the topic of gender and to help</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.080" end="00:00:23.900" style="s2">us with this very touchy subject I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.570" end="00:00:27.210" style="s2">one of the best writers about gender is</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.900" end="00:00:32.099" style="s2">Yvonne Ilic who wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.210" end="00:00:33.780" style="s2">gender in the 1980s and very soon after</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.099" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">writing this book he he disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:43.219" style="s2">completely he he left the public life</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">and one of the reasons for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.219" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">it was basically crucified for his</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">claims by the feminist establishment and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">his claims were that gender mattered</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">that gender was important and he pointed</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">out that in the nineteen century if</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">you&#39;d go to a farm you&#39;d see that all</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">the tools that were female were</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">completely designed in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">than the tools that were male in other</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">words gender in the in the history until</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">the 20th century was so extremely</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">polarized that it would be inconceivable</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">to think of the tasks of men and women</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">to be in any sense belonging to the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">sphere so it&#39;s no wonder that he was you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:37.560" style="s2">know so criticized</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:41.210" style="s2">I mean we&#39;ve greeted this breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.560" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">categories of genders has beingness</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.210" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">extraordinary emancipatory movement and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to take away from that but</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:02:01.850" style="s2">I think we were seeing today a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:02:01.850" style="s2">extreme collapse of categories which</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:08.039" style="s2">makes us want to go back and explore and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">rediscover what what gender is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.039" end="00:02:12.040" style="s2">I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">listening to this guy named Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:19.090" style="s2">pazzo and he was talking about how in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:21.640" style="s2">sports teams when you have the collapse</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.090" end="00:02:25.900" style="s2">of the categories of male and female in</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.640" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">sports teams the result is that the men</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.900" end="00:02:32.940" style="s2">dominate and that&#39;s because in most</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:36.670" style="s2">physical sports you know men are</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.940" end="00:02:40.690" style="s2">physically more stronger yeah physically</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.670" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">stronger and therefore if you collapse</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.690" end="00:02:45.790" style="s2">the boundary between male and female</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:54.970" style="s2">women get oppressed by their not having</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.790" end="00:02:58.810" style="s2">their own category so if you know women</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.970" end="00:03:02.379" style="s2">compete against each other and work with</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.810" end="00:03:04.180" style="s2">each other then you have female</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.379" end="00:03:06.519" style="s2">excellence rising to the top and we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.180" end="00:03:08.890" style="s2">appreciate that and if similarily if the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.519" end="00:03:10.540" style="s2">men you know compete and work with each</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.890" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">other you can have male excellence rise</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.540" end="00:03:16.540" style="s2">to the top and we can appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:18.760" style="s2">but in this very well-meaning desire to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.540" end="00:03:20.709" style="s2">collapse all all categories you collapse</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.760" end="00:03:25.989" style="s2">all the categories and the women end up</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.709" end="00:03:29.019" style="s2">being much more oppressed and bye-bye</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.989" end="00:03:32.590" style="s2">the so-called patriarchy then they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.019" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">before and I think this was even at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.590" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">next point it&#39;s this point is that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:43.060" style="s2">the industrial world when there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:53.319" style="s2">sort of non category this unisex</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.060" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">category it actually becomes a new form</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.319" end="00:03:56.859" style="s2">of oppression for women so</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:03:59.879" style="s2">complementarity means that the male and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.859" end="00:04:02.349" style="s2">female principle complement each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.879" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not at the in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.349" end="00:04:09.400" style="s2">eternal conflict which we see really</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">today yeah so that&#39;s all very nice and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.400" end="00:04:18.969" style="s2">good you might say but what do we do and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:21.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t all the games we&#39;ve made for women</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.969" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">important and of course I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.360" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">absolutely I mean you&#39;d have to be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">reactionary or you&#39;d have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:31.449" style="s2">somewhat malevolent person not not I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:34.180" style="s2">don&#39;t think want the best for all women</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.449" end="00:04:39.400" style="s2">but again you&#39;ve had this situation in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.180" end="00:04:42.100" style="s2">Sweden where the the the legal let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.400" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">categories of male and female genders</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.100" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">collapsed and you had a had even more</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:50.470" style="s2">extreme polarities result that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:51.990" style="s2">when you collapse the social categories</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.470" end="00:04:56.710" style="s2">of male and female</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.990" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">the deeper biological you know and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.710" end="00:05:01.930" style="s2">historical categories subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:08.889" style="s2">categories are man male and female</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.930" end="00:05:09.460" style="s2">remain and might even get to get get</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.889" end="00:05:10.840" style="s2">stronger</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.460" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">why do we might even become more</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.840" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">polarized so difference and what argue</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:21.639" style="s2">matters difference is important</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:26.740" style="s2">distinction is important to differences</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.639" end="00:05:30.669" style="s2">between us are important men and women</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.740" end="00:05:33.490" style="s2">are the same and different how are they</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.669" end="00:05:35.080" style="s2">the same I&#39;m not a social scientist but</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.490" end="00:05:38.860" style="s2">I think the research is pretty clear and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.080" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">then in this in this way that men and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.860" end="00:05:43.780" style="s2">women are just as smart as each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">and if you look on the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.780" end="00:05:48.700" style="s2">distributions you see that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:53.220" style="s2">more male Psychopaths you know and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.700" end="00:05:58.840" style="s2">more male geniuses as well unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.220" end="00:06:01.419" style="s2">nobody likes this but seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.840" end="00:06:03.910" style="s2">case and so what do we do okay so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.419" end="00:06:06.970" style="s2">obviously nobody is arguing that we well</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.910" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">some people are but a reasonable person</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.970" end="00:06:11.949" style="s2">would not argue that we go into this</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:15.370" style="s2">kind of regressive we go back into</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.949" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">history and where men were really men</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.370" end="00:06:18.940" style="s2">and women were really men also no just</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:20.949" style="s2">kidding</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.940" end="00:06:23.080" style="s2">where the men were men and women were</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.949" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">women and you know they lived in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.080" end="00:06:31.630" style="s2">sort of you know they had these fixed</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:34.180" style="s2">roles no one really wants that I studied</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.630" end="00:06:37.780" style="s2">I studied Zen and there was this in</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.180" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">Maxim and it goes something like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.780" end="00:06:42.300" style="s2">first there are mountains and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:44.620" style="s2">then there are no mountains and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.300" end="00:06:49.330" style="s2">then there are mountains and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.620" end="00:06:53.169" style="s2">again so mountains and rivers are the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.330" end="00:06:56.620" style="s2">male and the female principle right</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.169" end="00:06:59.560" style="s2">quite obviously that&#39;s one way to look</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.620" end="00:07:02.020" style="s2">at this formulation you could look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.560" end="00:07:06.030" style="s2">that in terms of male and female sex but</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.020" end="00:07:11.860" style="s2">you could also look at it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.030" end="00:07:14.440" style="s2">male and female tendencies or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.860" end="00:07:17.260" style="s2">receiving right which is the river the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.440" end="00:07:21.460" style="s2">river receives the earth the water</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.260" end="00:07:24.010" style="s2">receives the earth and the mountain the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.460" end="00:07:26.650" style="s2">mountain rises up out of the earth so</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.010" end="00:07:30.220" style="s2">they&#39;re very obvious male and female</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.650" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">symbolism there so yes in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.220" end="00:07:35.290" style="s2">of history men were men women were women</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:39.850" style="s2">and they both had very particular roles</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.290" end="00:07:41.560" style="s2">and then the postmodern age came along</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.850" end="00:07:50.620" style="s2">the modern and the postmodern age and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.560" end="00:07:53.710" style="s2">the Industrial Age and no men were not</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.620" end="00:07:56.050" style="s2">men anymore and women were not women</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.710" end="00:08:00.750" style="s2">anymore in other words these categories</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.050" end="00:08:04.360" style="s2">seemed insufficient and it seemed that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.750" end="00:08:07.780" style="s2">women and men both both wanted to cross</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.360" end="00:08:09.970" style="s2">over into the realm of the other which</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.780" end="00:08:10.900" style="s2">is a very interesting process if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.970" end="00:08:14.729" style="s2">could think of the male and the female</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.900" end="00:08:17.590" style="s2">principle you know beyond just merely</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.729" end="00:08:23.320" style="s2">the biological male and the biological</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.590" end="00:08:27.940" style="s2">female the synthesis and antithesis the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.320" end="00:08:33.070" style="s2">two different cosmic forces that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.940" end="00:08:36.310" style="s2">rubbing off each other and having this</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.070" end="00:08:40.360" style="s2">creative effect see because if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.310" end="00:08:44.020" style="s2">no polarity there&#39;s no spark there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.360" end="00:08:47.380" style="s2">child there&#39;s no creativity so there has</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.020" end="00:08:50.540" style="s2">to be polarity on the other hand if</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.380" end="00:08:52.910" style="s2">polarity gets too stuffy and uptight and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.540" end="00:08:56.440" style="s2">traditional the weight then the inertia</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.910" end="00:08:59.959" style="s2">gets such that the polarities collapse</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.440" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we&#39;re at right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.959" end="00:09:04.910" style="s2">you know largely in the culture is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:08.319" style="s2">the polarities have collapsed on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.910" end="00:09:11.029" style="s2">social level but on an unconscious or</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.319" end="00:09:13.639" style="s2">collective unconscious level or on a</p>

<p begin="00:09:13.639" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">subterranean levels you know of our who</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.190" end="00:09:19.069" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s still this male and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.069" end="00:09:27.649" style="s2">female dance going on and it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:32.990" style="s2">not a pretty dance particularly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.649" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">this can be quite almost violent but</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.990" end="00:09:39.079" style="s2">nevertheless is still going on there has</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.079" end="00:09:44.470" style="s2">integral age right so you have this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.959" end="00:09:49.639" style="s2">Ken Wilbur&#39;s formulation I and others</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.470" end="00:09:52.040" style="s2">you have the the modern age which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.639" end="00:09:57.350" style="s2">basically unisex right men anyway I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.040" end="00:09:59.690" style="s2">been doing the same job jobs then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.350" end="00:10:04.569" style="s2">have the postmodern age where you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.690" end="00:10:08.180" style="s2">almost a reversal you know of gender</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.569" end="00:10:12.130" style="s2">where men are meant to become very</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.180" end="00:10:16.339" style="s2">sensitive and maternal and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.130" end="00:10:18.440" style="s2">caregiving and all that and women are</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.339" end="00:10:21.500" style="s2">meant to be aggressive and assertive and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.440" end="00:10:28.760" style="s2">and compete in the male world and often</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.500" end="00:10:31.220" style="s2">out-compete them in and and all that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.760" end="00:10:33.439" style="s2">now we have you know and will will would</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.220" end="00:10:35.990" style="s2">say the next stage is the integral stage</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.439" end="00:10:38.899" style="s2">and obviously the integral stage would</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.990" end="00:10:44.870" style="s2">be when these repo Lera T&#39;s reassert</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.899" end="00:10:48.860" style="s2">themselves after after they&#39;ve collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.870" end="00:10:51.439" style="s2">and they&#39;ve learned the lesson of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.860" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">Apocalypse you could say because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.439" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">collapse of all categories is like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:11:00.860" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of an apocalypse it has its it</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:02.550" style="s2">has its great interest in benefits and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.860" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">fertile chaos</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.550" end="00:11:09.870" style="s2">I&#39;m not as critical as the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:15.720" style="s2">world this is perhaps Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.870" end="00:11:17.940" style="s2">or or others but but they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.720" end="00:11:20.760" style="s2">absolutely correct to point out that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.940" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">extreme dangers of a total apps collapse</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.760" end="00:11:27.690" style="s2">of category and the necessity for</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:29.910" style="s2">categories like gender to reassert</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.690" end="00:11:32.700" style="s2">themselves in fact they do reassert</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.910" end="00:11:35.160" style="s2">themselves this is Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.700" end="00:11:37.829" style="s2">example in Sweden there&#39;s more female</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.160" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">nurses and male engineers than ever</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.829" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">before and that&#39;s as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:49.079" style="s2">collapse of categories cuz you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:53.640" style="s2">nature is not this thing that we just</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.079" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">want to follow right well there also has</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.640" end="00:11:57.990" style="s2">to be a transcendental element to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:02.519" style="s2">experience you know nature and culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.990" end="00:12:04.430" style="s2">are always again it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.519" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">it&#39;s the symbolism of male and female</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.430" end="00:12:10.500" style="s2">even in and you know non-traditional</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.399" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">couples are gay couples you know you see</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.500" end="00:12:15.810" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s still there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:19.740" style="s2">a polarity going on there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.810" end="00:12:23.700" style="s2">dynamic there&#39;s still a receiver and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.740" end="00:12:27.390" style="s2">giver there&#39;s still this penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.700" end="00:12:31.370" style="s2">masculinity and this feminine</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.390" end="00:12:35.899" style="s2">receptivity there&#39;s also a fierce</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.370" end="00:12:39.750" style="s2">feminine archetype which tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.899" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">feared and not really represented in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.750" end="00:12:45.089" style="s2">culture except maybe in popular culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:48.029" style="s2">where it comes comes through but we</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.089" end="00:12:50.699" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have this you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.029" end="00:12:54.029" style="s2">I think feminists and don&#39;t don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.699" end="00:12:57.300" style="s2">to have this nice female archetype you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.029" end="00:13:01.350" style="s2">know because the female archetype can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.300" end="00:13:03.899" style="s2">ferocious as well just try to approach a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.350" end="00:13:07.589" style="s2">pregnant tiger you will have a taste of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.899" end="00:13:10.010" style="s2">the ferociousness of the female</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.589" end="00:13:10.010" style="s2">archetype</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.400" end="00:13:16.730" style="s2">so the beauty of these archetypes is</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.220" end="00:13:21.000" style="s2">that they have two sides they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.730" end="00:13:23.060" style="s2">monological so um I wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.000" end="00:13:26.279" style="s2">even illness because I think he</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.060" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">apparently he kind of brought this term</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.279" end="00:13:32.490" style="s2">gender into the discussion and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.670" end="00:13:35.670" style="s2">disappeared and then this term was taken</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.490" end="00:13:38.750" style="s2">over by the the post modernists so</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.670" end="00:13:45.029" style="s2">gender is always about oppression right</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.750" end="00:13:47.520" style="s2">okay which which it can be but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.029" end="00:13:49.950" style="s2">only one dimension of the story okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.520" end="00:13:51.630" style="s2">the other dimension of the story the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.950" end="00:13:55.740" style="s2">important dimension of the story is is</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.630" end="00:13:58.440" style="s2">its complementarity that the male and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.740" end="00:14:00.630" style="s2">female principles you know compliment</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.440" end="00:14:03.900" style="s2">each other so the mountain and the river</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.630" end="00:14:05.850" style="s2">are not two separate things I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.900" end="00:14:07.560" style="s2">listening to a Jewish mystic speak and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.850" end="00:14:09.570" style="s2">he said that in Jewish tradition the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.560" end="00:14:13.020" style="s2">Holy Spirit is considered too feminine</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.570" end="00:14:15.720" style="s2">and it says that in one of these you</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.020" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">know traditional texts like the Zohar it</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.720" end="00:14:23.130" style="s2">says if it&#39;s the woman principle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:24.750" style="s2">not present then the Holy thing then God</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.130" end="00:14:35.130" style="s2">is not present or the Holy Spirit is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.750" end="00:14:39.330" style="s2">present and so we don&#39;t want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.130" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">to polarity in that sense of the two</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.330" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">sexes being separate we want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">to polarity in the sense of the two</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:52.010" style="s2">sexes being interdependent and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:55.500" style="s2">interpenetrating and and creative and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.010" end="00:14:58.110" style="s2">renew that creative spark of polarity</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.500" end="00:15:02.760" style="s2">which gets lost when all categories are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.110" end="00:15:06.990" style="s2">flattened out there&#39;s no interest in</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.760" end="00:15:13.980" style="s2">being asexual or saying that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.990" end="00:15:19.880" style="s2">and polarity and difference and these</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.980" end="00:15:23.960" style="s2">traditional categories are not arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.880" end="00:15:26.420" style="s2">they&#39;re not socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.960" end="00:15:31.400" style="s2">were born into these categories and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.420" end="00:15:35.210" style="s2">we lose them and then they become</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.400" end="00:15:36.890" style="s2">valuable again I think that in my 20s I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.210" end="00:15:39.770" style="s2">didn&#39;t give a about masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.890" end="00:15:43.400" style="s2">what it meant you know I was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.770" end="00:15:47.830" style="s2">interested in being a person and I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.400" end="00:15:50.810" style="s2">very close to women and and I had this</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.830" end="00:15:53.720" style="s2">extreme love of women and I wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.810" end="00:15:57.160" style="s2">a woman almost I grew my hair long you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.720" end="00:16:01.280" style="s2">know there&#39;s this identification with</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.160" end="00:16:03.020" style="s2">the female sex and and then later on I I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.280" end="00:16:06.490" style="s2">realized that I that I was missing</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.020" end="00:16:13.130" style="s2">something that that that the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.490" end="00:16:14.960" style="s2">force is key is is important and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.130" end="00:16:18.670" style="s2">needed to read reintegrate that or I</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.960" end="00:16:24.590" style="s2">need to reintegrate that being a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.670" end="00:16:27.140" style="s2">postmodern feminist guy I need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.590" end="00:16:32.930" style="s2">to become highly you know assertive and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.140" end="00:16:36.110" style="s2">cutting in fierce in a masculine way not</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.930" end="00:16:38.870" style="s2">just kind and open and compassionate all</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.110" end="00:16:42.770" style="s2">those valuable stereotypical feminine</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.870" end="00:16:45.170" style="s2">characteristics so the cutting edge</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.770" end="00:16:46.820" style="s2">right as my friend David fuller says the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.170" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">cutting edge really is is is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.820" end="00:16:54.110" style="s2">rediscovery of polarity in this time you</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:56.050" style="s2">know something different in the 60s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.110" end="00:17:01.550" style="s2">sixties it was the rediscovery of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.050" end="00:17:09.170" style="s2">freedom from polarity now is the time</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.550" end="00:17:10.900" style="s2">for reintegration of polarity that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.170" end="00:17:14.290" style="s2">least that&#39;s what it seems like to me</p>
