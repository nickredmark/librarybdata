<p begin="00:00:09.960" end="00:00:13.889" style="s2">cooperative that supports all of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.490" end="00:00:15.929" style="s2">projects and humanity and our individual</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.889" end="00:00:19.980" style="s2">lives while working our individual</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">projects so we have some things on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.980" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">agenda today and i&#39;m gonna try to stay</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">muted when I&#39;m not talking chains other</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:34.980" style="s2">people will need to be unmuted and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:37.230" style="s2">talking where is the agenda so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.980" end="00:00:39.270" style="s2">team up one who is the one who found</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.230" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">that that seems like a cool option we</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.270" end="00:00:43.500" style="s2">definitely wanted a calendar that I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">just briefly looking at it for literally</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.500" end="00:00:55.110" style="s2">that&#39;s 30 seconds before we went live it</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">says for small teams I&#39;m not sure I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.110" end="00:01:09.810" style="s2">way too many things open this is usually</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">my issue okay I just wanted I just found</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.810" end="00:01:14.700" style="s2">it because of what I was gonna do but</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:16.470" style="s2">put all the board meetings and just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.700" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">sturdy round tables and anything else</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.470" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">that came up to the project group on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">calendar and also I thought it would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">a good idea because I said I forget when</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">things that happen in and they&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">the date and the links there and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:35.869" style="s2">added to like the welcome document and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:37.950" style="s2">document it that&#39;s in the files area and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.869" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">I had another idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:42.119" style="s2">don&#39;t nobody want me to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:44.189" style="s2">now but it&#39;s it&#39;s by the said small</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.119" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">teams and it&#39;s free forever which you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">kinda liked and it gives you two</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:51.479" style="s2">calendars but also I think other people</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:53.579" style="s2">could join up and then so they I can add</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.479" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">them to the calendar so they can add</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.579" end="00:01:59.119" style="s2">whatever stuff that the port on because</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.280" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">I thought that would be a better way</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">just so it&#39;s there so people can</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:05.930" style="s2">actually see in advance and then the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">second calendar could be stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.930" end="00:02:12.330" style="s2">happening in game be like the the glass</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">bead game and rule Omega and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.330" end="00:02:17.100" style="s2">that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:19.860" style="s2">could two people and you can just go</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.100" end="00:02:21.570" style="s2">enjoy I thought that if we put that on</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.860" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">the set maybe on the second calendar</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.570" end="00:02:25.740" style="s2">than you solution raisins and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">else you want and then after two</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.740" end="00:02:30.990" style="s2">calendars there so people have got a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.330" end="00:02:33.450" style="s2">choice and then maybe we could add you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.990" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">know then as I said things that I come</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.450" end="00:02:39.030" style="s2">across in game be they&#39;re going on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">regular basis and I can put them on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.030" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">calendars and then people can actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:45.810" style="s2">see in whether they want and as I said</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:49.160" style="s2">the links there and everything say so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.810" end="00:02:49.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.350" end="00:02:57.940" style="s2">and maybe also that second counter could</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.300" end="00:03:01.990" style="s2">be for things like you know other</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.940" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">project events like Adriel you know just</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.990" end="00:03:08.350" style="s2">for people that wanted to do the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:11.560" style="s2">wiki gonna see the wiki election join</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.350" end="00:03:13.330" style="s2">those meetings and then we were just</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:15.390" style="s2">talking about another kind of regular</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.330" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">weekly meeting that we don&#39;t want posted</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.390" end="00:03:19.660" style="s2">we don&#39;t want everyone posting all their</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:22.540" style="s2">specific events on their specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.660" end="00:03:24.489" style="s2">project and the main discussion feed but</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.540" end="00:03:26.920" style="s2">that might be a good place that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.489" end="00:03:29.140" style="s2">can connect to other projects and see</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.920" end="00:03:34.090" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and a separate calendar</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.140" end="00:03:37.060" style="s2">from the main one also I had to note</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.090" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">that idea of so like an experiment and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.060" end="00:03:41.890" style="s2">social cohesion is that what you call it</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:45.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s this thing called them</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.890" end="00:03:49.870" style="s2">they&#39;ve logo and from did this talk ages</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.400" end="00:03:52.209" style="s2">ago about developing triads not never</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.870" end="00:03:54.280" style="s2">forgetting that you&#39;re Batman and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.209" end="00:03:56.620" style="s2">it&#39;s so I was thinking of maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.280" end="00:03:58.540" style="s2">people posting about it in the group and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.620" end="00:04:00.820" style="s2">asking whether people wanted to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.540" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">part in this experiment where we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.820" end="00:04:07.870" style="s2">safer four weeks right the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:10.209" style="s2">conversation so if if people want to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.870" end="00:04:11.739" style="s2">it so they talk to three-peat so take</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.209" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">three people I would I would facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.739" end="00:04:17.709" style="s2">the first one and then let them go and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:21.070" style="s2">do whatever and then after that have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.709" end="00:04:23.290" style="s2">come back and see what you know what he</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.070" end="00:04:24.370" style="s2">felt whether they managed whether he got</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.290" end="00:04:27.160" style="s2">to know each other better</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.370" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">and then and take it from there and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.160" end="00:04:33.700" style="s2">do groups of three as an experiment in</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:36.910" style="s2">them social cohesion and getting to know</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.700" end="00:04:38.650" style="s2">each other better and maybe if I can get</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.910" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">someone with a with a project that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.650" end="00:04:44.229" style="s2">the go someone with ideas and someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:46.330" style="s2">who&#39;s looking for the project worked it</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.229" end="00:04:47.800" style="s2">will depends on them time zones and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:49.810" style="s2">things like that I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.800" end="00:04:52.300" style="s2">doing that and then that could go on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.810" end="00:04:54.310" style="s2">second calendar you know see you having</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.300" end="00:04:56.140" style="s2">chats reduce you know I mean and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.310" end="00:04:57.940" style="s2">that I think that would be actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.140" end="00:05:00.130" style="s2">quite quite Goods and think you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.940" end="00:05:02.830" style="s2">quite fun as well about so I need to let</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.130" end="00:05:03.849" style="s2">work on questions for the first one just</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.830" end="00:05:05.619" style="s2">to break the ice</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.849" end="00:05:07.539" style="s2">with everybody because I know people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.619" end="00:05:10.779" style="s2">quite apprehensive about talking to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.539" end="00:05:13.029" style="s2">people that they don&#39;t know so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.779" end="00:05:16.679" style="s2">maybe do a bit of that so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.029" end="00:05:16.679" style="s2">what you think about that as well I</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.249" end="00:05:21.879" style="s2">think that&#39;s an interesting idea I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.990" end="00:05:25.659" style="s2">that&#39;d be something worth sharing in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.879" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">main game B page to get an idea of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.659" end="00:05:29.529" style="s2">many people would be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:35.259" style="s2">participate before you put much energy</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.529" end="00:05:37.209" style="s2">into it and then we have another I guess</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.259" end="00:05:40.899" style="s2">there&#39;s another game be kind of video</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.209" end="00:05:42.009" style="s2">discussion group I don&#39;t remember but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.899" end="00:05:43.449" style="s2">think that&#39;s where you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.009" end="00:05:45.099" style="s2">record a video and post it in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.449" end="00:05:47.979" style="s2">discussion so that&#39;s did that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.099" end="00:05:51.550" style="s2">asynchronous as opposed to being at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.979" end="00:05:55.059" style="s2">same one am i right on that you mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.550" end="00:05:57.159" style="s2">game be conversations yeah yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.059" end="00:05:59.379" style="s2">conversations has basically become Brent</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.159" end="00:06:01.119" style="s2">Cooper&#39;s just posts his stuff his</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.379" end="00:06:03.399" style="s2">conversations there I haven&#39;t seen any</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.119" end="00:06:05.229" style="s2">other anyone else post anything there I</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.399" end="00:06:06.729" style="s2">haven&#39;t posted any of my conversations</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.229" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve had with like Raymond and such</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.729" end="00:06:11.099" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t be revitalized</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:12.759" style="s2">there it doesn&#39;t even have the game be</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.099" end="00:06:14.559" style="s2">Brian&#39;s name are like I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.759" end="00:06:18.339" style="s2">Richie and I think it was Nick who</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.559" end="00:06:19.719" style="s2">started it I have been yeah so it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.339" end="00:06:22.229" style="s2">like there&#39;s anything like that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.719" end="00:06:24.579" style="s2">talked a long time ago about creating a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.229" end="00:06:27.639" style="s2">system where people could just sign up</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.579" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">and it would kind of randomly put three</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.639" end="00:06:31.930" style="s2">people together and stuff but we never</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:35.079" style="s2">really built that but care if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.930" end="00:06:38.379" style="s2">little bit of time and energy a person</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.079" end="00:06:39.849" style="s2">can do that better than the system but</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.379" end="00:06:41.110" style="s2">we just didn&#39;t have time so where they</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.849" end="00:06:43.029" style="s2">were putting together a system together</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.110" end="00:06:44.889" style="s2">a bit but yeah I think that&#39;d be worth</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.029" end="00:06:46.749" style="s2">kind of just writing up what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.889" end="00:06:49.329" style="s2">do posting it the regular game B group</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.749" end="00:06:51.399" style="s2">and and seeing would participate I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.329" end="00:06:55.449" style="s2">probably be willing to participate in</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.449" end="00:06:59.379" style="s2">component in the project drew first</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.089" end="00:07:01.659" style="s2">because as I said there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.470" end="00:07:20.980" style="s2">time zone because you know as I said</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:24.430" style="s2">they could facilitate the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.980" end="00:07:26.200" style="s2">regardless because I don&#39;t have to go</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.250" end="00:08:19.540" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.580" end="00:08:23.710" style="s2">so yes join huh</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.540" end="00:08:25.240" style="s2">I have to say I watched the TED talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.710" end="00:08:27.340" style="s2">that you referred to about the Triads</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.240" end="00:08:29.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve liked his waking up Batman waking</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.340" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">up the idea people haven&#39;t seen it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.380" end="00:08:33.700" style="s2">that there&#39;s a Batman cartoon where</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">Batman Bruce Wayne is kidnapped and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.700" end="00:08:37.810" style="s2">waiting for Batman to come and save him</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:39.070" style="s2">and he doesn&#39;t realize that he&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.810" end="00:08:41.320" style="s2">that and so then he remembers he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:43.870" style="s2">Batman and the guys talked about how we</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.320" end="00:08:45.640" style="s2">all can remember where Batman right I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.870" end="00:08:47.530" style="s2">which I find a little weird cuz Batman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.640" end="00:08:49.300" style="s2">a billionaire like no we can&#39;t all be</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.530" end="00:08:51.160" style="s2">Bruce Wayne there&#39;s a reason he can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.300" end="00:08:53.020" style="s2">it without superpowers but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.160" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">time we all are about man and realizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.020" end="00:08:57.160" style="s2">that but I didn&#39;t think he made the case</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">for the Triad like he he didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.160" end="00:09:03.370" style="s2">like I don&#39;t like he wasn&#39;t like he</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:04.930" style="s2">didn&#39;t give evidence as to why three he</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.370" end="00:09:06.610" style="s2">was just like threes the number three&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.930" end="00:09:10.570" style="s2">a number accepting couples but you kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.610" end="00:09:11.980" style="s2">of add third relationships in all of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.570" end="00:09:16.060" style="s2">other relationships you haven&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.980" end="00:09:19.030" style="s2">relationship is its number one I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.060" end="00:09:20.530" style="s2">like I feel like Kevin Bray his micro</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:53.779" style="s2">think hey let&#39;s just play let&#39;s just try</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.230" end="00:09:55.370" style="s2">well as I said there&#39;s a lot of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.779" end="00:09:58.009" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.370" end="00:10:00.589" style="s2">evidence so what have you both three is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.009" end="00:10:02.839" style="s2">a magic number and it&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.589" end="00:10:04.550" style="s2">the song but it actually is you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.839" end="00:10:06.860" style="s2">mean cuz like everything you do is in</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.220" end="00:10:23.810" style="s2">schreeten and this is from marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.500" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">now that you love them people remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.810" end="00:10:30.500" style="s2">three things more than you&#39;ll remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:32.540" style="s2">four or five so M although I ate all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.500" end="00:10:35.209" style="s2">marketing stuff but I&#39;m just like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.540" end="00:10:38.060" style="s2">idea of three people coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.209" end="00:10:40.819" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the power of three you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.060" end="00:10:42.980" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of bizarre as well so</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.819" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">it&#39;s all kinds of motion with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.980" end="00:10:46.670" style="s2">microphone Authority and power the three</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:48.920" style="s2">triads</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.670" end="00:10:51.560" style="s2">yeah stuff like that there&#39;s all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.920" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">of motion mushed up I like I like mashed</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.560" end="00:10:58.550" style="s2">of things so it might be part of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:11:02.569" style="s2">wounding but there&#39;s also a real shadow</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.550" end="00:11:04.220" style="s2">side two triads like any little girls</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.569" end="00:11:05.720" style="s2">hanging out it&#39;s like you have three</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.220" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">girls it&#39;s going to descend into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.720" end="00:11:09.230" style="s2">because two of them and they exclude one</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:10.850" style="s2">and you don&#39;t I mean like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.230" end="00:11:13.850" style="s2">something that happens and try it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.850" end="00:11:16.730" style="s2">every movie and every like it&#39;s like yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.850" end="00:11:18.980" style="s2">Harry Potter and Hermione and and Ron</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.730" end="00:11:21.199" style="s2">but like really it Ron and Harry or</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.980" end="00:11:26.660" style="s2">Harry and Hermione and then Ron Hermione</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.199" end="00:11:28.100" style="s2">get married but like it&#39;s a like to just</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.660" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">say it needs to be three so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.100" end="00:11:31.370" style="s2">three like I think playing with three</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:32.810" style="s2">and then seeing does it did it work out</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.370" end="00:11:34.370" style="s2">right like did people show up</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.810" end="00:11:36.769" style="s2">consistently or did you end up with one</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.370" end="00:11:37.939" style="s2">person just showing up because or just</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.769" end="00:11:41.329" style="s2">two people throwing up and was that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.939" end="00:11:43.069" style="s2">awkward but start with three just maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.329" end="00:11:43.570" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t stick with three doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.069" end="00:11:48.940" style="s2">mean the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.570" end="00:11:53.050" style="s2">is broken happy by two more three is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.940" end="00:11:54.820" style="s2">lowest number which is not - and when</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.050" end="00:11:57.250" style="s2">you have four you have a group which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.820" end="00:12:00.130" style="s2">totally different dynamic but three is</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.250" end="00:12:05.380" style="s2">something like when the two people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.130" end="00:12:07.210" style="s2">just a dialogue and it&#39;s easy to lose</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.380" end="00:12:10.930" style="s2">perspective on whatever it is that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.210" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">know about this third it&#39;s a spectator</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.930" end="00:12:19.120" style="s2">only or observer all just it&#39;s uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:21.660" style="s2">mmm it grounds the whole thing and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:24.460" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely something about three</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.660" end="00:12:26.230" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve noticed that when I try to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.460" end="00:12:28.360" style="s2">sort of summarize and explain things the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.230" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">number three shows up a lot but I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.360" end="00:12:32.170" style="s2">it&#39;s also good not to be at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:33.700" style="s2">ideological loaded if it&#39;s - its - if</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.170" end="00:12:35.320" style="s2">it&#39;s five it&#39;s five and there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.700" end="00:12:37.480" style="s2">an upper limit like if it&#39;s seventeen</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.320" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">maybe trying to simplify a bit but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.480" end="00:12:42.370" style="s2">think yeah there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">saying like it just happens to show up a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.370" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">lot and that might be something you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:47.290" style="s2">notice verses because you notice that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.760" end="00:12:52.870" style="s2">now you&#39;re always shooting for three and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.290" end="00:12:54.760" style="s2">if it&#39;s not three or wrong I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.870" end="00:12:56.710" style="s2">I&#39;ll give it going and see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.760" end="00:12:59.560" style="s2">and that because as I said it it could</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.710" end="00:13:03.580" style="s2">be just just a shitshow a so if just</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.560" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">like I think I think it&#39;d be quite fun</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.580" end="00:13:07.960" style="s2">as well you know I mean and yeah I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:10.470" style="s2">give it I&#39;ll give it a shot and see</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.960" end="00:13:10.470" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.650" end="00:13:13.420" style="s2">awesome what was the other thing on our</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.820" end="00:13:15.850" style="s2">agenda</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.420" end="00:13:17.650" style="s2">oh the wiki I think it&#39;s also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.850" end="00:13:19.930" style="s2">fallen by the wayside in fact the people</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.650" end="00:13:21.430" style="s2">who were doing the wiki basically said</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.930" end="00:13:23.290" style="s2">that they were going to delete it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.430" end="00:13:25.240" style="s2">they there&#39;s something happening always</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.290" end="00:13:28.510" style="s2">like down the pipeline for it never</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.240" end="00:13:30.520" style="s2">right they just stood it back up and got</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.510" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">the security fixed so that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.520" end="00:13:35.410" style="s2">coming back up because it&#39;s now in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:39.550" style="s2">stable state that could go forward so</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.410" end="00:13:41.770" style="s2">they do have a projects page and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.550" end="00:13:45.550" style="s2">I just wanted to talk about did we want</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.770" end="00:13:48.580" style="s2">to do anything with that I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.550" end="00:13:54.100" style="s2">least we&#39;d want to add a link to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.580" end="00:13:56.290" style="s2">nack site and add a link to Kerry&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.100" end="00:13:58.570" style="s2">whenever you&#39;re ready carry with your</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.290" end="00:14:00.430" style="s2">Drupal site and then we could just say</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.570" end="00:14:02.620" style="s2">you know these are experimental lists</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.430" end="00:14:06.360" style="s2">and then you can also add yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.620" end="00:14:10.120" style="s2">the list below which is on the wiki site</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.360" end="00:14:12.430" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of like minimum I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.120" end="00:14:14.920" style="s2">suggest and I&#39;m happy to do that work</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.430" end="00:14:16.630" style="s2">it&#39;s not that much then the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.920" end="00:14:19.750" style="s2">is we could take a look at it because</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.630" end="00:14:22.120" style="s2">they&#39;d have it broken out I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.750" end="00:14:25.270" style="s2">systems where you force a sort on people</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.120" end="00:14:28.930" style="s2">and they&#39;re breaking up the projects by</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.270" end="00:14:30.370" style="s2">first by topic area which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.930" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">weird because projects often cover</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.370" end="00:14:36.760" style="s2">multiple topic areas and then then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.380" style="s2">list your project in the topic area so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.760" end="00:14:40.120" style="s2">don&#39;t know if anyone here who has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.380" end="00:14:43.240" style="s2">project like wiki election or meet with</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.120" end="00:14:44.680" style="s2">reason score or Mar - she&#39;s I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.240" end="00:14:47.290" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna be talking about your</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.680" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">project soon wants to duplicate it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.290" end="00:14:54.340" style="s2">all three places or what but yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:57.400" style="s2">just I just want to see what everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.340" end="00:15:00.610" style="s2">kind of thought about III was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.400" end="00:15:03.790" style="s2">them what I thought when I looked at it</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.610" end="00:15:05.890" style="s2">I thought okay so you&#39;ve got projects</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.790" end="00:15:08.440" style="s2">are kinds about then in game Bay and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.890" end="00:15:11.140" style="s2">maybe people have got their own projects</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.440" end="00:15:11.830" style="s2">and what I didn&#39;t want is to put stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.140" end="00:15:13.540" style="s2">up there</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.830" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">so I didn&#39;t know whether we could just</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.540" end="00:15:18.970" style="s2">keep it as a game B project group and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:21.820" style="s2">then maybe list the projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.970" end="00:15:23.500" style="s2">coming up within the group and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.820" end="00:15:26.440" style="s2">everyone was doing and all</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.500" end="00:15:28.090" style="s2">so the second thing was if you put a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.440" end="00:15:33.430" style="s2">project up there is someone gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.090" end="00:15:35.410" style="s2">along and say no that&#39;s no game anyway</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.430" end="00:15:38.860" style="s2">well what is game being they look well</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.410" end="00:15:40.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you know I mean and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.860" end="00:15:43.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t want people to put the stuff up</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.810" end="00:15:47.110" style="s2">there and then to be told oh that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.270" end="00:15:48.940" style="s2">game B you know I mean so and and like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.110" end="00:15:51.310" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t clear of what and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.940" end="00:15:53.980" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was worried about like oK</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.310" end="00:15:55.390" style="s2">we&#39;ve all met in the game B space and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.980" end="00:15:57.070" style="s2">we&#39;re all waiting on our own stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.390" end="00:15:59.500" style="s2">we&#39;re all collaborating together so</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.070" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of all been assimilated into</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.500" end="00:16:04.780" style="s2">the bog now you know I mean so and any</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:06.610" style="s2">ideas that do to like pop up like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.780" end="00:16:09.580" style="s2">stuff about the marriage counseling</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.610" end="00:16:11.800" style="s2">thing with wreaths and Alex that and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.580" end="00:16:14.770" style="s2">know I mean that that came and started</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.800" end="00:16:16.330" style="s2">growing legs when things grew like soon</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.770" end="00:16:18.070" style="s2">as I said if I put that up there and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.330" end="00:16:21.100" style="s2">then you might say oh no that&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.070" end="00:16:22.540" style="s2">game B you know I mean so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.100" end="00:16:24.700" style="s2">what I&#39;m worried about there people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.540" end="00:16:26.830" style="s2">gonna come along and and then where</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.700" end="00:16:28.990" style="s2">would you put things as you settled with</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.830" end="00:16:30.940" style="s2">the categories I was like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.990" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">kind of that and it&#39;s time to that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.940" end="00:16:39.160" style="s2">is it that which might be we might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:41.140" style="s2">able to talk to the wiki people and like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.160" end="00:16:43.390" style="s2">if we&#39;re taking on projects we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.140" end="00:16:45.820" style="s2">on projects right that we are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.390" end="00:16:47.589" style="s2">making which we do have a meeting about</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.820" end="00:16:48.580" style="s2">it like what is a game B project cuz</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.589" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">you&#39;re right there&#39;s ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.580" end="00:16:52.510" style="s2">consider a game B project that probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.620" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be wiki game B project right</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.510" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s when people come in and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.620" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">looking for a project they probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:16:57.820" style="s2">don&#39;t want to work on a marriage</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.250" end="00:17:06.069" style="s2">trying to and having almost more of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.920" end="00:17:07.420" style="s2">spreadsheet or sort of table like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.069" end="00:17:09.819" style="s2">know wiki election is dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.420" end="00:17:11.770" style="s2">politics and sense-making like having it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.819" end="00:17:13.089" style="s2">more that there are these categories and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.770" end="00:17:15.310" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with with all of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.089" end="00:17:17.890" style="s2">right like solution raising what</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.310" end="00:17:19.510" style="s2">category is that all of them because we</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.890" end="00:17:21.130" style="s2">could do a solution raising all of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.510" end="00:17:23.290" style="s2">but none of them at the same time since</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.130" end="00:17:26.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t a solution raising in it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.290" end="00:17:28.900" style="s2">not you donate like it&#39;s they are hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.350" end="00:17:30.610" style="s2">to categorize but with our various ones</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.900" end="00:17:31.990" style="s2">being able to figure out what we already</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.610" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">have on the table and how would we</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.990" end="00:17:36.310" style="s2">present that and how would we do a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:37.460" style="s2">criteria is a game B or not because</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.310" end="00:17:38.990" style="s2">that&#39;s we have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.460" end="00:17:40.039" style="s2">there are some projects I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.990" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">her game because they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.039" end="00:17:44.210" style="s2">potential or they don&#39;t have but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:49.190" style="s2">get to be the arbiter of that like what</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.210" end="00:17:51.110" style="s2">having a very like to me and game be</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.190" end="00:17:53.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like is it adjacent possible is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.110" end="00:17:55.399" style="s2">big future utopia those aren&#39;t good or</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.720" end="00:17:57.169" style="s2">bad it&#39;s just I want to know right i</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.399" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">want to know REMS he&#39;s common planet is</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.169" end="00:18:01.130" style="s2">big picture utopia and he&#39;s got stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:03.799" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna be working for the pipeline</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.130" end="00:18:07.490" style="s2">to get there right but like I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.799" end="00:18:09.649" style="s2">know do we make our stuff fit into</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.490" end="00:18:10.010" style="s2">there&#39;s in which case we got to figure</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.649" end="00:18:13.039" style="s2">that out</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.010" end="00:18:15.409" style="s2">or is it does that become ours and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:17.299" style="s2">got to figure out how to do the projects</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.409" end="00:18:20.090" style="s2">I mean we can&#39;t decide that because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.299" end="00:18:23.419" style="s2">don&#39;t have wiki right so I mean it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.090" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">open wiki so anyone can sign up and make</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.419" end="00:18:28.909" style="s2">changes and I and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:32.179" style="s2">the intent of the project they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.909" end="00:18:34.520" style="s2">they haven&#39;t put approvals needed in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.179" end="00:18:36.470" style="s2">system so I think their their idea is</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.520" end="00:18:40.580" style="s2">you come you know it&#39;s a community built</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.470" end="00:18:42.740" style="s2">thing all right I don&#39;t know I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.580" end="00:18:45.470" style="s2">completely reformat these pages because</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.740" end="00:18:53.330" style="s2">I really think that this user experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.470" end="00:18:54.919" style="s2">is pretty horrific so I might reach out</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.330" end="00:18:56.809" style="s2">to them on the site and say hey can I</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.919" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">try like redesigning this page and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.809" end="00:19:01.399" style="s2">explaining why I think I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:02.899" style="s2">having to to click through to different</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.399" end="00:19:04.760" style="s2">things and then just seeing a name of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.899" end="00:19:06.529" style="s2">project and having no idea what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.760" end="00:19:08.360" style="s2">about until I click through it and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.529" end="00:19:14.059" style="s2">having to back up three pages to find</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.360" end="00:19:16.130" style="s2">the next so yes so we could discuss yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.059" end="00:19:17.929" style="s2">so yeah so I would say that if we want</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.130" end="00:19:19.700" style="s2">to participate in this and we just go in</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.929" end="00:19:22.220" style="s2">the game be wiki and say hey we had some</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.700" end="00:19:24.020" style="s2">other ideas on how to improve this how</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.220" end="00:19:25.640" style="s2">to put all content in and then we each</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.020" end="00:19:29.000" style="s2">need to decide whether we want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.640" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">maintain our content and you know four</p>

<p begin="00:19:36.529" end="00:19:41.929" style="s2">we don&#39;t need the next site of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.570" end="00:19:43.820" style="s2">the next sites a lot you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.929" end="00:19:46.100" style="s2">lot better a lot of ways we haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.820" end="00:19:48.049" style="s2">what Kerry&#39;s doing on the other side so</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.100" end="00:19:50.340" style="s2">just just so we know what everything&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.220" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">say hey you know we&#39;d like to take this</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.600" end="00:19:58.890" style="s2">page over deal want us to coordinate</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.890" end="00:20:02.100" style="s2">make changes yell tell us we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.539" end="00:20:03.750" style="s2">it it depends on how much they care</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.100" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">about it if they&#39;re going to do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.750" end="00:20:09.029" style="s2">whole wiki I think I&#39;d be happy to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:10.950" style="s2">someone take over a section of the site</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.029" end="00:20:13.529" style="s2">so they can focus on the overall thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.950" end="00:20:16.460" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know for a fact that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.529" end="00:20:20.520" style="s2">they like so good we could just ask oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.460" end="00:20:21.870" style="s2">yeah Facebook page post and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.520" end="00:20:24.210" style="s2">taking it over then we can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.870" end="00:20:26.039" style="s2">what is the best user experience for</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.210" end="00:20:27.270" style="s2">people coming in like well people want</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.039" end="00:20:29.700" style="s2">to find a project they want to know</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.270" end="00:20:31.020" style="s2">who&#39;s who to contact who do like it they</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.700" end="00:20:32.820" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go through like you said</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.020" end="00:20:35.940" style="s2">all of that I just looked at it got</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.820" end="00:20:38.010" style="s2">terrific like that because because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.940" end="00:20:39.630" style="s2">not even you can&#39;t like it is if we had</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:41.190" style="s2">stuff under all of those categories and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.630" end="00:20:43.140" style="s2">you clicked on agriculture and there was</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.190" end="00:20:45.299" style="s2">20 different projects but there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.140" end="00:20:48.260" style="s2">why did you click on transition B and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.299" end="00:20:50.669" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing and so knowing and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.260" end="00:20:53.010" style="s2">there&#39;s many different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.669" end="00:20:55.169" style="s2">categorize it that isn&#39;t quite working</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.010" end="00:20:56.580" style="s2">and it makes sense we&#39;re in the projects</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.169" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">right where we&#39;re dealing with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.580" end="00:21:01.950" style="s2">stuff with our own with our projects but</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:03.510" style="s2">also with oh is this a game B project is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.950" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">it how do we criteria that how do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.510" end="00:21:08.549" style="s2">which categories are this that although</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:10.770" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be not an easy thing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.549" end="00:21:13.830" style="s2">will be a good thing for projects to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.770" end="00:21:14.909" style="s2">through this and it&#39;ll yeah I think it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.830" end="00:21:16.860" style="s2">feeds back into it</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.909" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">both are individual projects and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.860" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">Omni when together tech and we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:24.419" style="s2">need to pare that out for our own like</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:26.220" style="s2">like for the neck side and for the and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.419" end="00:21:28.740" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve come sat down and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.220" end="00:21:31.860" style="s2">wrote out what our suggestions are like</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.740" end="00:21:33.299" style="s2">I think one is you know the if the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.860" end="00:21:36.029" style="s2">person&#39;s gonna be represented they need</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.299" end="00:21:38.070" style="s2">to be active in the game B community I</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.029" end="00:21:40.470" style="s2">don&#39;t think we should be adding projects</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.070" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">that are or if we are it should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.470" end="00:21:45.299" style="s2">closely designated like here are</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:48.450" style="s2">projects that no one&#39;s in game be doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.299" end="00:21:50.520" style="s2">it but it fits the game B things but</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.450" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">then who&#39;s gonna maintain that listing</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.520" end="00:21:54.210" style="s2">right and so I think it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:56.039" style="s2">clear these are the ones because people</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.210" end="00:21:57.419" style="s2">are participating this computer these</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.039" end="00:21:59.390" style="s2">these are the ones we think are</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.419" end="00:22:01.890" style="s2">interesting and you may want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.390" end="00:22:04.560" style="s2">which is fine to have all those but</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.890" end="00:22:07.290" style="s2">someone needs to agree to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.560" end="00:22:08.820" style="s2">yeah if we want to add those we may also</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.290" end="00:22:10.770" style="s2">want to reach out to the people involved</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.820" end="00:22:12.210" style="s2">in that project to make sure that a we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.770" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">know who to reach out to so we can put</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.210" end="00:22:16.920" style="s2">on there but also say hey we&#39;re a part</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:18.630" style="s2">of this kick community that might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.920" end="00:22:21.000" style="s2">able to provide you with some people to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.630" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">work with you if you want to get that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.000" end="00:22:25.590" style="s2">please you know join us here here&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:27.090" style="s2">of the level of participation that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.590" end="00:22:29.400" style="s2">need to do even if it&#39;s just joining a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.090" end="00:22:32.700" style="s2">group and watching a page to be clear I</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.400" end="00:22:35.130" style="s2">don&#39;t think we should include this but</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.700" end="00:22:37.380" style="s2">if someone wants to I would say well</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.130" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">then you need to maintain it you need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.380" end="00:22:40.050" style="s2">do all the right stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:41.700" style="s2">yeah I guess I&#39;m kind of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.050" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">bridging that gap like I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.700" end="00:22:45.180" style="s2">that we should either but if we hear</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">about our project that sounds cool maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.180" end="00:22:52.680" style="s2">do a bit of outreach quite often for</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">that um as I said I&#39;m a bit wary of so</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.680" end="00:22:56.970" style="s2">like putting projects on a list or I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:23:00.510" style="s2">got no contact with and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.970" end="00:23:03.300" style="s2">whether or what information they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.510" end="00:23:05.160" style="s2">going on and I don&#39;t know what stage the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.300" end="00:23:07.530" style="s2">project is at because like some people</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.160" end="00:23:09.270" style="s2">just and would you put people&#39;s ideas up</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.530" end="00:23:11.730" style="s2">there as well would you you know if</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.270" end="00:23:14.700" style="s2">someone&#39;s working on an idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.730" end="00:23:16.200" style="s2">working towards and it&#39;s you know and to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.700" end="00:23:18.270" style="s2">do in bits and pieces would you have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.200" end="00:23:20.310" style="s2">different stage of what though</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.270" end="00:23:24.300" style="s2">what status the project was then like</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.310" end="00:23:25.950" style="s2">idea qualen development that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.300" end="00:23:27.180" style="s2">I mean so it&#39;s at the different</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.950" end="00:23:29.850" style="s2">categories because that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.180" end="00:23:32.130" style="s2">going to ask you for what I&#39;m designing</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.850" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">and what I&#39;m putting together from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.130" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">information I&#39;ve took the categories and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:38.040" style="s2">everything that&#39;s off the NOC site but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:41.270" style="s2">was just wondering whether you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.040" end="00:23:45.240" style="s2">whether it was an idea whether it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.270" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">you know in planning development um</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.240" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">already up and running you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:51.240" style="s2">because that&#39;s you know that&#39;s not know</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:53.100" style="s2">clear and as I said if you&#39;ve got people</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.240" end="00:23:54.690" style="s2">who yet haven&#39;t spoke to you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.100" end="00:23:57.000" style="s2">what stage that are you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.690" end="00:23:58.590" style="s2">info that they want made public you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.000" end="00:24:00.210" style="s2">you don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re ready so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.590" end="00:24:02.700" style="s2">I think so they having some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.210" end="00:24:04.470" style="s2">conversation with them to find out what</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.700" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">it is or even if they&#39;re actually still</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.470" end="00:24:08.940" style="s2">doing it or they&#39;ve given up or you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:11.430" style="s2">I mean also the collaborating with</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.940" end="00:24:14.430" style="s2">somebody else you know I mean so I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.430" end="00:24:16.940" style="s2">that would be good to know yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.430" end="00:24:20.900" style="s2">my thought is I do worry about them</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.940" end="00:24:23.240" style="s2">of work for all this so a rule that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.900" end="00:24:26.990" style="s2">kind of like or a guideline is that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.240" end="00:24:28.820" style="s2">person whose wants to put the project in</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.990" end="00:24:31.010" style="s2">the directory needs to put it in there</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.820" end="00:24:32.920" style="s2">and they need to maintain it and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.010" end="00:24:35.390" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be incumbent on anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.920" end="00:24:37.190" style="s2">and then I&#39;d almost like to have it to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.390" end="00:24:39.350" style="s2">where you know if there&#39;s no updates in</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.190" end="00:24:41.300" style="s2">like six months or a year it just falls</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.350" end="00:24:45.890" style="s2">off into the old category and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.300" end="00:24:48.380" style="s2">further down not in the main list that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.890" end="00:24:50.210" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to have in a system I</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.380" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know if anyone else wants</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.210" end="00:24:55.340" style="s2">different stuff I think and this is I</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:57.350" style="s2">think what you just said added to and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.340" end="00:24:59.840" style="s2">that because there&#39;s the people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.350" end="00:25:01.370" style="s2">created game Bjorn consider very game B</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.840" end="00:25:03.650" style="s2">and they&#39;ve left and they&#39;d have their</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.370" end="00:25:07.070" style="s2">own going on right Eric Weinstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.650" end="00:25:09.350" style="s2">doing Unity 2020 Jordan Hall has CBM</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.070" end="00:25:10.700" style="s2">those to be our game B projects but</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.350" end="00:25:12.650" style="s2">they&#39;re not under the game B umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.700" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">and the people who are interested in one</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.650" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">would be interested in the other then</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:18.500" style="s2">there&#39;s people in game be participating</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:20.570" style="s2">in game B who have their own projects</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.500" end="00:25:22.970" style="s2">that aren&#39;t game B but very game be like</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.570" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">the stoah and rebel wisdom and future</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.970" end="00:25:28.010" style="s2">thinkers that have them like but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:29.180" style="s2">still very broad the some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.010" end="00:25:32.120" style="s2">broadcast and some of them are right</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.180" end="00:25:34.100" style="s2">they also have their own clubs and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.120" end="00:25:37.160" style="s2">to participate in and how much money</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.100" end="00:25:39.110" style="s2">they are and how what like I want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.160" end="00:25:41.570" style="s2">know what that information is before I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.110" end="00:25:43.430" style="s2">get involved and who to contact to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.570" end="00:25:45.650" style="s2">but if they are not updating it right if</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.430" end="00:25:48.380" style="s2">David fuller isn&#39;t coming and updating</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.650" end="00:25:49.820" style="s2">the rebel wisdom one and Mike and UV</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.380" end="00:25:52.670" style="s2">aren&#39;t coming in and you know doing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.820" end="00:25:55.430" style="s2">future thinkers that&#39;s us doing work to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.670" end="00:25:56.900" style="s2">get them more people it&#39;s not like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.430" end="00:25:59.060" style="s2">gonna be the opposite and people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.900" end="00:26:01.340" style="s2">gonna find us through them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.060" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">know I mean go to other things at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.340" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">same time those are things that I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:09.500" style="s2">maybe people are going to be interested</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:11.270" style="s2">in but so I like the idea of only having</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.500" end="00:26:12.710" style="s2">things that there are game B people in</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.270" end="00:26:13.820" style="s2">who wanted to put them in which case we</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.710" end="00:26:15.350" style="s2">might get rebel with them we might get</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.820" end="00:26:20.630" style="s2">future thinkers because they might put</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.350" end="00:26:22.430" style="s2">them in there right but yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.630" end="00:26:24.920" style="s2">and we have the you know and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.430" end="00:26:27.260" style="s2">game B wiki that are lists like perfect</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.920" end="00:26:28.850" style="s2">periphery similar things already in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.260" end="00:26:32.500" style="s2">list somewhere and there&#39;s game being</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.850" end="00:26:37.429" style="s2">news what is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.500" end="00:26:40.429" style="s2">nick is doing anyway so yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.429" end="00:26:45.380" style="s2">couple like information depots for game</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.429" end="00:26:46.580" style="s2">be and can be ish but yeah but I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.380" end="00:26:49.220" style="s2">we do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:50.929" style="s2">I think projects like for people that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.220" end="00:26:52.490" style="s2">are and then having some way to sort and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.929" end="00:26:55.309" style="s2">filter and find what you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.490" end="00:26:57.049" style="s2">participate in would be helpful which</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.309" end="00:27:01.880" style="s2">was what we&#39;ve kind of built a knack and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.049" end="00:27:03.500" style="s2">stuff so I&#39;m happy going to the site now</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.880" end="00:27:05.059" style="s2">I would just go ahead I&#39;m just gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.500" end="00:27:07.159" style="s2">and make a change and put a link to our</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.059" end="00:27:09.220" style="s2">necks it--and Kerry do you want a link</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.159" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">to your site yet or is it not there yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.220" end="00:27:15.500" style="s2">I&#39;m not quite there yeah as I said I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:18.440" style="s2">just got a I said this week it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.500" end="00:27:20.630" style="s2">been like so los been wrong with this</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.440" end="00:27:22.669" style="s2">week it just everything just kind of up</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.630" end="00:27:25.789" style="s2">in the air for a bit a bit you know so</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.669" end="00:27:28.400" style="s2">I&#39;m a beast I&#39;m starting again on Monday</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.789" end="00:27:31.309" style="s2">and because as I said everything&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.400" end="00:27:33.409" style="s2">quite pear-shaped it away so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.309" end="00:27:36.020" style="s2">gonna give yourself a few days off from</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.409" end="00:27:40.070" style="s2">meself for them see how it goes from</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.020" end="00:27:42.799" style="s2">there and Monday more focused and less</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.070" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">crap and then I could just start the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.799" end="00:27:47.090" style="s2">conversation with them in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">working space to say hey we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.090" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">projects if y&#39;all want us to like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:56.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know the word manage this page and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:59.539" style="s2">group of pages and facilitate that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.360" end="00:28:00.770" style="s2">we&#39;re happy to consider putting in an</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.539" end="00:28:02.360" style="s2">umbrella I don&#39;t want to make a promise</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.770" end="00:28:04.130" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna do it because because</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.360" end="00:28:08.840" style="s2">we may choose Kerry&#39;s page we made</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.130" end="00:28:11.510" style="s2">choose a neck separate you may do all</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.840" end="00:28:14.200" style="s2">the above but I think just putting the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.510" end="00:28:17.900" style="s2">links and then saying hey how much how</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.200" end="00:28:19.850" style="s2">find out from them how possessive they</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.900" end="00:28:23.179" style="s2">are of that page and if they&#39;re not then</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.850" end="00:28:26.840" style="s2">we can brainstorm some more so I can do</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.179" end="00:28:29.000" style="s2">all that the other risk of us doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.840" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">anything on that is that the wiki has</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.000" end="00:28:35.000" style="s2">been cancelled so many times that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:36.919" style="s2">like and then rebooted and stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.000" end="00:28:38.419" style="s2">it&#39;s like well if we put that work in it</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.919" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">and it gets rebooted again does that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.419" end="00:28:43.340" style="s2">work still there or does it just go by</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:45.049" style="s2">the wayside all together where is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.340" end="00:28:47.929" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like there&#39;s a possum</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.049" end="00:28:49.879" style="s2">doing the knack or the Drupal one and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.929" end="00:28:52.070" style="s2">then linking to it from there right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.879" end="00:28:55.159" style="s2">if they&#39;re up and running hey we have we</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.070" end="00:28:58.009" style="s2">have of this all covered and doing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.159" end="00:29:01.399" style="s2">yeah it may be taking that whole page</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.009" end="00:29:02.809" style="s2">down and just putting a link to neck and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.399" end="00:29:05.239" style="s2">say hey if you want to know about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.809" end="00:29:08.299" style="s2">projects here&#39;s how you get to I</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.239" end="00:29:12.289" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t I would I don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.299" end="00:29:14.149" style="s2">would like if we did that but yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.289" end="00:29:15.830" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s definitely possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.149" end="00:29:17.419" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good point we need to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.830" end="00:29:20.950" style="s2">sure we don&#39;t put a lot of effort into</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.419" end="00:29:23.450" style="s2">something that may not be long term</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.950" end="00:29:26.539" style="s2">that&#39;s the information overlap match</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.450" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">between the wiki and the wiki which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.539" end="00:29:37.100" style="s2">by the way deserves a better graphics</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:38.419" style="s2">and user interface it&#39;s not very are you</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.100" end="00:29:40.759" style="s2">talking about you don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.419" end="00:29:42.769" style="s2">specific one or just Wikimedia in</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.759" end="00:29:45.139" style="s2">general because it&#39;s all good sports</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.769" end="00:29:46.909" style="s2">Wikimedia it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.139" end="00:29:49.820" style="s2">custom-built site they just through wiki</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.909" end="00:29:53.869" style="s2">yeah yeah there are plugins that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.820" end="00:29:56.299" style="s2">help but they have a very strict concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.869" end="00:29:58.039" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t like the the UI it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.299" end="00:30:01.100" style="s2">more like we just need to tell them to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.039" end="00:30:04.609" style="s2">go with a different tech okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.100" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">that&#39;s also possibility but I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.609" end="00:30:11.389" style="s2">there is a lot of information between</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:16.100" style="s2">the wiki and that big Google document</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.389" end="00:30:18.830" style="s2">about baby which is big and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.100" end="00:30:21.830" style="s2">read to them both so I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.830" end="00:30:23.749" style="s2">ask if you have an idea how similar they</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.830" end="00:30:29.149" style="s2">are if they contain the same information</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.749" end="00:30:31.220" style="s2">or as it&#39;s like I don&#39;t recall</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.149" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">I remember that Google Doc there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.220" end="00:30:40.009" style="s2">the the dark there&#39;s they&#39;re still like</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:42.859" style="s2">five or six Reis resources like this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.009" end="00:30:46.609" style="s2">sure they all overlap to some extent but</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.859" end="00:30:52.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how much and people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.609" end="00:30:53.749" style="s2">reluctant to consolidate so so yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.340" end="00:30:56.749" style="s2">was your thought on that if they overlap</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.749" end="00:30:59.179" style="s2">a lot did we want to suggest finishing</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.749" end="00:31:02.700" style="s2">or just consolation</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.179" end="00:31:07.590" style="s2">which is I always suggest consolidation</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.700" end="00:31:11.640" style="s2">but given how difficult it is even to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.590" end="00:31:15.000" style="s2">fine maybe as a finger and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.640" end="00:31:19.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it should not be even defined as</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.000" end="00:31:24.059" style="s2">people say and I was thinking for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.559" end="00:31:29.880" style="s2">past 20 minutes about why this is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.059" end="00:31:34.140" style="s2">and what crossed my mind is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.880" end="00:31:37.230" style="s2">that&#39;s similar to what how you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.140" end="00:31:40.770" style="s2">explain for example riding a bicycle to</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.230" end="00:31:43.940" style="s2">someone who cannot write and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.770" end="00:31:50.900" style="s2">that there is something similar here</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.940" end="00:31:55.290" style="s2">like like we can ride bicycles right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.900" end="00:31:58.890" style="s2">we kind of have shared understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.290" end="00:32:03.179" style="s2">what it is and how it feels and what it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.890" end="00:32:06.260" style="s2">does it&#39;s on the other hand difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.179" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">explain to someone who cannot do it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.260" end="00:32:12.929" style="s2">what makes it more interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:16.470" style="s2">bicycles are just a subcategory of all</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.929" end="00:32:23.669" style="s2">things that can be that you can write on</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.470" end="00:32:27.870" style="s2">so if the general population of game B</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.669" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">is based on Facebook right they write</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.870" end="00:32:33.660" style="s2">bicycles and then someone comes in who</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:38.490" style="s2">rice and monocycle or something even</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.660" end="00:32:42.570" style="s2">like weirder than the discussion if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.490" end="00:32:47.700" style="s2">going to be or not it&#39;s got really</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.570" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">tricky I&#39;m not sure if I make myself</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.700" end="00:32:57.450" style="s2">clear but it&#39;s just it&#39;s weird that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:33:00.750" style="s2">difficult to explain and define</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.450" end="00:33:03.419" style="s2">something that yeah something like this</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:05.730" style="s2">and a lot of people don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.419" end="00:33:07.950" style="s2">should define it harshly because as you</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.730" end="00:33:09.809" style="s2">said because it&#39;s like riding a bike and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.950" end="00:33:11.870" style="s2">part of that&#39;s just your subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.809" end="00:33:15.289" style="s2">brain learning</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.870" end="00:33:16.460" style="s2">although I think there&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.289" end="00:33:17.750" style="s2">she could know about riding bike that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.460" end="00:33:19.460" style="s2">would make the learning experience a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.750" end="00:33:20.690" style="s2">easier if people would tell you like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.460" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">faster you&#39;re going the easier it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.690" end="00:33:25.669" style="s2">because the centripetal force and people</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:26.870" style="s2">don&#39;t explain that to kids and then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.669" end="00:33:31.460" style="s2">end up going slow and falling off a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.870" end="00:33:36.740" style="s2">little but yeah so people don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.460" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">define game B and so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.740" end="00:33:44.029" style="s2">reason why these kind of things have</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:48.289" style="s2">difficulty and they don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.029" end="00:33:49.909" style="s2">canonical definition so they want you</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.289" end="00:33:52.940" style="s2">know these these multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.909" end="00:33:54.590" style="s2">views and stuff and they want to be some</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.940" end="00:34:00.010" style="s2">extent hard I think Jubilees talked</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.590" end="00:34:06.409" style="s2">about that effort is part of the value</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.010" end="00:34:08.750" style="s2">but it breaks my Aussie d-brane yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.409" end="00:34:10.940" style="s2">think when we had the previous meeting</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.750" end="00:34:13.190" style="s2">on sort of what is a game B project you</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.940" end="00:34:16.220" style="s2">sort of had some ideas but it might just</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.190" end="00:34:18.169" style="s2">end up being only being defined by what</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.220" end="00:34:20.089" style="s2">it&#39;s not and we you know might sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.169" end="00:34:21.830" style="s2">have the blanket statement on hey will</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.089" end="00:34:23.450" style="s2">it almost anything in but we always</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.830" end="00:34:26.450" style="s2">reserve the right as a group to say oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.450" end="00:34:28.190" style="s2">no go away right like there might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.450" end="00:34:30.109" style="s2">certain things out of the gate like hey</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.190" end="00:34:32.570" style="s2">if your project is advocating any sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.109" end="00:34:34.580" style="s2">of genocide no you don&#39;t you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.570" end="00:34:36.379" style="s2">come in and that may sound silly but you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.580" end="00:34:39.950" style="s2">know some of the conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.379" end="00:34:41.089" style="s2">we&#39;ve had happen in the game B group you</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.950" end="00:34:43.399" style="s2">may not have thought that you had to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.089" end="00:34:47.300" style="s2">have a rule around that but turns out</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.399" end="00:34:48.740" style="s2">that you do so it may just be a list of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.300" end="00:34:50.780" style="s2">things that it isn&#39;t that might be an</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.740" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">easier way to appease the people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.780" end="00:34:54.740" style="s2">don&#39;t want to define it or just be sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:56.510" style="s2">of open and say hey this is more under</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.740" end="00:34:59.630" style="s2">the together tech umbrella we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.510" end="00:35:02.270" style="s2">you know a group of people&#39;s idea about</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.630" end="00:35:04.760" style="s2">one thing that game B could be so we</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.270" end="00:35:07.250" style="s2">aren&#39;t defining game B but we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.760" end="00:35:11.270" style="s2">operating a game big group of projects</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.250" end="00:35:13.010" style="s2">that you disagree with are you know what</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.270" end="00:35:15.260" style="s2">we say it can be project is that then</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.010" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">come join us and have a conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.260" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">whole point is that it&#39;s not just me or</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:21.020" style="s2">just Jubilee or just Bentley saying what</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:22.250" style="s2">is or isn&#39;t it&#39;s right now you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.020" end="00:35:25.510" style="s2">five of us and then hopefully it&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.250" end="00:35:25.510" style="s2">of us and hopefully it&#39;s a hundred of us</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.580" end="00:35:30.380" style="s2">what is and what isn&#39;t and we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.460" end="00:35:32.330" style="s2">saying as a part of game B but it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.380" end="00:35:34.580" style="s2">of game be adjacent it&#39;s one you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.330" end="00:35:37.730" style="s2">trial run at game B which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.580" end="00:35:39.790" style="s2">hard to be a game B project so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.730" end="00:35:42.230" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of being a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.790" end="00:35:43.970" style="s2">community and gay audience but also</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.230" end="00:35:45.710" style="s2">being open and saying hey if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.970" end="00:35:47.960" style="s2">disagree with what we&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.710" end="00:35:49.580" style="s2">that&#39;s fine you can start your own or</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.960" end="00:35:59.780" style="s2">you can join us in try to you know add</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.580" end="00:36:02.330" style="s2">in your opinion and see who agrees one</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.780" end="00:36:04.070" style="s2">of the thing just not so much in game B</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.330" end="00:36:05.450" style="s2">itself but one of the meta projects that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.070" end="00:36:08.870" style="s2">keeps coming up in the solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.450" end="00:36:10.400" style="s2">is um the guilt fraps like that we need</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.870" end="00:36:12.530" style="s2">to know what&#39;s going on in tech and how</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.400" end="00:36:14.570" style="s2">and what you know what I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.530" end="00:36:16.670" style="s2">use and what&#39;s in the making and when is</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.570" end="00:36:18.530" style="s2">it going to be available and one for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.670" end="00:36:21.980" style="s2">greater in fact mark just posted it</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.530" end="00:36:24.410" style="s2">right something under greater like what</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.980" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">to buy is it game B ish right if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.410" end="00:36:27.800" style="s2">buying deodorant what&#39;s the most game B</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:31.010" style="s2">deodorants I can buy or something along</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.800" end="00:36:32.830" style="s2">those lines one of the other things the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.010" end="00:36:35.450" style="s2">third thing which I&#39;m getting is like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.830" end="00:36:38.900" style="s2">dragon&#39;s den for game B projects right</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.450" end="00:36:41.660" style="s2">we&#39;re not just because we&#39;ve no funding</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.900" end="00:36:44.750" style="s2">to give so it&#39;s literally billionaires</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.660" end="00:36:48.050" style="s2">they were like yes but to actually like</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.750" end="00:36:50.810" style="s2">have criteria of like is this possible</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.050" end="00:36:52.340" style="s2">what the like MVP what is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.810" end="00:36:53.510" style="s2">we could do right now or is it something</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.340" end="00:36:56.150" style="s2">that needs like a resource-based economy</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.510" end="00:36:58.850" style="s2">you need to have basically the whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.150" end="00:37:00.500" style="s2">planet on board like partly to put it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.850" end="00:37:04.130" style="s2">those categories not to say it&#39;s good or</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.500" end="00:37:06.200" style="s2">bad and then how did you that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.130" end="00:37:07.790" style="s2">that&#39;s not broadcast only five people</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.200" end="00:37:09.860" style="s2">get to decide whether your project is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.790" end="00:37:11.540" style="s2">good enough because and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.860" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">conversation that I&#39;d had this last week</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.540" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">it was like okay maybe I don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:18.470" style="s2">the thing in this project but does</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:20.210" style="s2">anyone has anyone contacted you and been</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.470" end="00:37:22.820" style="s2">like oh my god I want to get involved or</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.210" end="00:37:24.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a similar idea because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.820" end="00:37:26.390" style="s2">ideas that come up again and again in</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.260" end="00:37:28.190" style="s2">game B right should somebody create a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.390" end="00:37:31.340" style="s2">social media platform that would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.190" end="00:37:33.470" style="s2">awesome like it&#39;s like but it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.340" end="00:37:35.660" style="s2">know because it is it&#39;s clearly an idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.470" end="00:37:37.130" style="s2">that&#39;s needed but whatever we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.660" end="00:37:38.210" style="s2">isn&#39;t quite working to get it out into</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.130" end="00:37:38.920" style="s2">the world right because it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.210" end="00:37:40.089" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.920" end="00:37:42.039" style="s2">to people who think they have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.089" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">concept how do we bring them together</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.039" end="00:37:45.789" style="s2">and work through what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:49.660" style="s2">there&#39;s people who have one-off projects</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.789" end="00:37:51.670" style="s2">that are really amazing ideas and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.660" end="00:37:53.140" style="s2">don&#39;t like I don&#39;t even know what that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.670" end="00:37:55.720" style="s2">would look like but something along the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.140" end="00:37:56.980" style="s2">lines of a Dragon&#39;s Den hey is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.720" end="00:37:58.809" style="s2">financially where are you getting your</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.980" end="00:38:00.700" style="s2">financing from there&#39;s a lot of them are</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.809" end="00:38:02.230" style="s2">just like wait is this sustainable is</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.700" end="00:38:03.579" style="s2">this actually which doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.230" end="00:38:05.549" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean to be necessarily if</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.579" end="00:38:07.869" style="s2">there&#39;s ideas I have that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.549" end="00:38:10.210" style="s2">charity people are gonna give money to</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.869" end="00:38:13.180" style="s2">it you hope in it but anyway having</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.210" end="00:38:15.279" style="s2">criteria than saying yes you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.180" end="00:38:19.059" style="s2">yeah even sustainability though as far</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.279" end="00:38:20.200" style="s2">as something people will donate to just</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.059" end="00:38:24.339" style="s2">kind of throw that out there it does</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.200" end="00:38:27.430" style="s2">need some input it could just be</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.339" end="00:38:29.200" style="s2">volunteering or donations yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.430" end="00:38:31.390" style="s2">thinking of it I was throwing out the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.200" end="00:38:33.670" style="s2">idea what if we had that except it was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.390" end="00:38:35.619" style="s2">bunch of light software Debs that would</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.670" end="00:38:38.170" style="s2">volunteer their time assuming it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.619" end="00:38:40.420" style="s2">tack solution right that would that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.170" end="00:38:42.220" style="s2">would do like we did have your you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.420" end="00:38:45.220" style="s2">not quite ten thousand people but a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.220" end="00:38:47.410" style="s2">group a dozen or so of volunteers that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.220" end="00:38:48.730" style="s2">would marketing and or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.410" end="00:38:50.740" style="s2">thing we need and then they would be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.730" end="00:38:52.539" style="s2">drag instead thing where we have two or</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.740" end="00:38:54.220" style="s2">three people come in with their ideas we</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.539" end="00:38:57.819" style="s2">give them feedback and say okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.220" end="00:39:00.670" style="s2">it&#39;s ready for this group to throw fire</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.499" end="00:42:05.289" style="s2">then see what what we can maybe do</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.950" end="00:42:06.670" style="s2">because I&#39;m fed off of people say well</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.289" end="00:42:09.310" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to tick the boxes</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.070" end="00:42:23.620" style="s2">need to know what&#39;s what what&#39;s accepted</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.650" end="00:42:25.420" style="s2">what standards and that be able to turn</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.620" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">into right okay that&#39;s the standard</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.420" end="00:42:31.420" style="s2"> we&#39;ve got something better over</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">here you know a man stops oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.420" end="00:42:34.420" style="s2">it&#39;s part of creating game B is like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:36.760" style="s2">have to work within game a as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.420" end="00:42:39.610" style="s2">because you just earned it which mine</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.760" end="00:42:40.780" style="s2">because something like I&#39;ve got a game a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.610" end="00:42:41.980" style="s2">project that I&#39;ve kind of stopped</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.780" end="00:42:43.900" style="s2">working on because I didn&#39;t find it that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.980" end="00:42:45.490" style="s2">interesting and it didn&#39;t match my skill</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.900" end="00:42:47.800" style="s2">sets but I still think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.490" end="00:42:50.860" style="s2">possibility there but part of me like</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.800" end="00:42:53.320" style="s2">wants to find a spot to sort of put it</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.860" end="00:42:58.120" style="s2">into like the together tech type thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.320" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">to help fund projects like that so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.120" end="00:43:01.180" style="s2">think that might be interesting if there</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:03.160" style="s2">is a way to say like hey here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.180" end="00:43:04.780" style="s2">obvious game B projects and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.160" end="00:43:07.180" style="s2">projects that in their nature are kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.780" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">of game a but trying to be done in as</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.180" end="00:43:12.220" style="s2">game B way as possible and where the end</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:14.200" style="s2">result is any profits go back into these</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.220" end="00:43:16.360" style="s2">projects to help fun right so like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.200" end="00:43:18.910" style="s2">got multiple income streams so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.360" end="00:43:23.530" style="s2">stable in a game a sense but for game D</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.910" end="00:43:29.190" style="s2">purposes yeah and I think our Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.530" end="00:43:29.190" style="s2">calls kind of I mean it was based off I</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:33.790" style="s2">just forgot the word that you asked your</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.840" end="00:43:36.100" style="s2">mind mastermind yeah based off the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.790" end="00:43:38.320" style="s2">mastermind concept and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.100" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">mean we&#39;re not experts in finance and</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.320" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">legal but I could tell you unless you</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:45.490" style="s2">have you know a hundred or a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:47.530" style="s2">customers you shouldn&#39;t be considered</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.490" end="00:43:50.140" style="s2">about legal you shouldn&#39;t be creating an</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.530" end="00:43:51.910" style="s2">LLC or whatever it is like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.140" end="00:43:53.710" style="s2">a lot of people do that stuff way too</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.910" end="00:43:56.260" style="s2">early they get business cards and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.710" end="00:43:58.350" style="s2">get do the legal stuff and it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.260" end="00:44:01.210" style="s2">got to know whether your idea works</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.350" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">before you even bother with that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.210" end="00:44:03.850" style="s2">will say on that note the weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:06.730" style="s2">exception is something like to</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.850" end="00:44:09.220" style="s2">Kickstarter or because you could you you</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.730" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">you can go from zero customers to 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.220" end="00:44:13.000" style="s2">customers and if you don&#39;t incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">first you have to claim that as personal</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.000" end="00:44:18.760" style="s2">income and then yeah that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:20.500" style="s2">reason why I incorporated wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.760" end="00:44:23.080" style="s2">and now I kind of wish</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.500" end="00:44:24.610" style="s2">I didn&#39;t but only because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.080" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">Kickstarter didn&#39;t take off if it did I</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.610" end="00:44:30.010" style="s2">want him clad I did so what someone is</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:32.740" style="s2">in in Canada in the US it&#39;s not a huge</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.010" end="00:44:34.510" style="s2">tax difference okay I mean if I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.740" end="00:44:37.480" style="s2">a personal business I can still write</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.510" end="00:44:39.010" style="s2">everything off without incorporating so</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.480" end="00:44:40.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s not a huge difference</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.010" end="00:44:41.890" style="s2">the only thing is if you have partners</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.360" end="00:44:43.870" style="s2">and you want to make sure that you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.890" end="00:44:46.540" style="s2">equity then you have to do all that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.870" end="00:44:48.700" style="s2">but still it&#39;d be better to write</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.540" end="00:44:50.350" style="s2">something down on a napkin and legalize</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.700" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">it later unless you&#39;re investing money</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.350" end="00:44:55.210" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re just doing volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re just doing sweat equity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.210" end="00:44:59.620" style="s2">the legal stuff is just overkill and/or</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:01.600" style="s2">distraction until you know the idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.620" end="00:45:03.760" style="s2">works and then if you did a kickstart</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.600" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">and I got real popular although these</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.760" end="00:45:06.250" style="s2">days it&#39;s hard to get a popular</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:07.960" style="s2">Kickstarter without doing a couple</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.250" end="00:45:11.890" style="s2">months of marketing before yeah which</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.960" end="00:45:13.600" style="s2">yeah looking back I did my Kickstarter</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.260" end="00:45:30.910" style="s2">not like what is my personal vision of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.080" end="00:45:33.340" style="s2">what I think is the best project but</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.910" end="00:45:35.980" style="s2">actually like what are the game B</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.340" end="00:45:38.110" style="s2">projects not just projects but including</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.530" end="00:45:45.970" style="s2">best place to go is ie that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.840" end="00:45:47.140" style="s2">send new people right like when people</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.910" end="00:45:52.230" style="s2">and possibly just I mean a price</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.140" end="00:45:55.390" style="s2">comparison at a time can be comparison</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.230" end="00:45:57.460" style="s2">and under the umbrella also if we had</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.390" end="00:45:59.290" style="s2">the best option for game B that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.460" end="00:46:01.540" style="s2">gonna actually create game B what is it</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.290" end="00:46:03.460" style="s2">and is it like we have money to fund but</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.540" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">people who do have money to fund and</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.460" end="00:46:08.200" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for something it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">as a group being all of game B was like</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.200" end="00:46:12.690" style="s2">this is the one we think is the most has</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:16.090" style="s2">the most potential like I really like um</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.690" end="00:46:19.600" style="s2">for manufacturing Wow cube spawn I can</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.090" end="00:46:23.740" style="s2">remember his name at the moment James um</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.600" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">that but that&#39;s it&#39;s so much money right</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.740" end="00:46:28.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same as as funding the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">smaller projects like he doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.120" end="00:46:31.210" style="s2">that much money his project needs money</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">right whereas he&#39;s like I can live off</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.210" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">of nothing but his project costs a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:36.530" style="s2">there&#39;s projects that are the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:38.990" style="s2">of that they cost so very little and</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.530" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">have have them intact I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.990" end="00:46:45.349" style="s2">actually be able to like all of Gabey</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:46.609" style="s2">asks is the dragon dead right people put</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.349" end="00:46:48.800" style="s2">up their project and we ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.609" end="00:46:50.569" style="s2">and then say hey which one is the best</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.800" end="00:46:53.150" style="s2">one which one are we sponsoring this one</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.569" end="00:46:56.390" style="s2">right to say that if you if we had money</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.150" end="00:47:00.050" style="s2">here&#39;s who we would forgive into without</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.390" end="00:47:02.690" style="s2">and then also that also then the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.050" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">read says these are the people who also</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.690" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">should give your time to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:08.540" style="s2">write that we&#39;re endorsing its person</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.079" end="00:47:11.780" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for say to say that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.540" end="00:47:14.900" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s a completely side project</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.780" end="00:47:16.099" style="s2">you&#39;ve done a solution raising on I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.900" end="00:47:16.250" style="s2">just trying to think about what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.099" end="00:47:18.200" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.250" end="00:47:21.650" style="s2">it seems to think that there was</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.200" end="00:47:24.680" style="s2">something we did kind of like well I</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.650" end="00:47:26.059" style="s2">guess we did what would manifest game B</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.680" end="00:47:27.740" style="s2">or something there was one where we did</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.059" end="00:47:29.030" style="s2">something like that but maybe it would</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.740" end="00:47:33.710" style="s2">be interesting to have that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.030" end="00:47:37.339" style="s2">as as a solution raising or idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.710" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">what you know what project do we think</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.339" end="00:47:44.750" style="s2">would accelerate this manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:46.819" style="s2">game being projects and honestly to me I</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.750" end="00:47:49.220" style="s2">think it would be that thing were you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.819" end="00:47:51.170" style="s2">saying oh I&#39;m coming in how do I get</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.220" end="00:47:53.569" style="s2">educate how do I do that personal work</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.170" end="00:47:56.020" style="s2">so I&#39;d like to see an application that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.569" end="00:47:57.950" style="s2">guides people that helps them do</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.020" end="00:47:59.569" style="s2">self-assessment test to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.950" end="00:48:01.700" style="s2">things they need to work on the most and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.569" end="00:48:03.740" style="s2">then point them to the free and the cost</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.700" end="00:48:06.829" style="s2">resources and help them choose it out</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.740" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">and had that be community curated so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.829" end="00:48:11.240" style="s2">could go on there and so anyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:13.400" style="s2">community could go on there and make</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.240" end="00:48:15.829" style="s2">either write an algorithm that says</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.400" end="00:48:18.680" style="s2">here&#39;s the education resources I want or</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.829" end="00:48:22.549" style="s2">put in resources and links and build</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.680" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">curriculum that I think would be the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.549" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">most effective tool and that&#39;s my second</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:30.859" style="s2">one after reason score but I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:32.780" style="s2">work if other people really say oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.859" end="00:48:35.000" style="s2">that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.780" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">then I&#39;d be happy to you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.000" end="00:48:39.410" style="s2">collaborate with some people on that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:41.180" style="s2">think that&#39;s more anything does personal</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.410" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">development encompass that I could do a</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.180" end="00:48:44.660" style="s2">solution raising on personal development</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:46.069" style="s2">and that piece of it and especially in</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.660" end="00:48:47.360" style="s2">game V I don&#39;t know they don&#39;t come to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.069" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">that conclusion but</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.360" end="00:48:52.250" style="s2">that is yeah yeah yeah yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:53.540" style="s2">definitely one about personal</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.250" end="00:48:55.460" style="s2">development I think par that will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.540" end="00:48:58.460" style="s2">come on is is there any tools that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.460" end="00:48:59.900" style="s2">can do to grease that personal</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.460" end="00:49:01.460" style="s2">development make it tore people fall</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.900" end="00:49:04.220" style="s2">into the pit of success rather than</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.460" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">confusion I someone ironically did one</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.220" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">on like self-help industry but with</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:12.790" style="s2">self-help industry people not Gabey</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:14.900" style="s2">people and under the self-help umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.790" end="00:49:16.940" style="s2">most of people are who in there also</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.900" end="00:49:18.470" style="s2">want jobs in that same arena so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.940" end="00:49:20.090" style="s2">really hard for them to picture getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.470" end="00:49:27.470" style="s2">rid of those jobs like I&#39;m like how do</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.090" end="00:49:28.940" style="s2">we have coaching without a coach I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.470" end="00:49:31.840" style="s2">sorry I want to put you out of a job but</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.940" end="00:49:37.370" style="s2">it&#39;s for the betterment of humanity oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.840" end="00:49:39.230" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean I would think that they</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.370" end="00:49:41.120" style="s2">that they would best spin their well</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.230" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">people always need individual one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.120" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">coaching but to make it less necessary</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:47.360" style="s2">and the things you know they should have</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:48.890" style="s2">resources they could go to learn on</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.360" end="00:49:51.260" style="s2">their own and then have the coach help</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.890" end="00:49:53.000" style="s2">them focus that right so the coaching</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.260" end="00:49:54.680" style="s2">and I think really honestly this the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.000" end="00:49:56.420" style="s2">where education goes in general is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.680" end="00:49:58.310" style="s2">teacher shouldn&#39;t be lecturing you</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.420" end="00:50:00.200" style="s2">should be watching the best video about</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.310" end="00:50:01.880" style="s2">that topic or over the five best videos</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.200" end="00:50:04.670" style="s2">in the whole world and then the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.880" end="00:50:06.080" style="s2">comes in and and answers questions and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.670" end="00:50:07.400" style="s2">helps you through that cognitive thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.080" end="00:50:09.020" style="s2">or if it wasn&#39;t explained well well</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.400" end="00:50:11.030" style="s2">here&#39;s a resource that&#39;s more visual</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.020" end="00:50:14.120" style="s2">you&#39;re more of a visual learner that</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.030" end="00:50:15.650" style="s2">sort of thing which that&#39;s all in my</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.120" end="00:50:17.150" style="s2">idea the same tool whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.650" end="00:50:18.950" style="s2">completely self-directed or something</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.150" end="00:50:20.750" style="s2">used in schools and then something also</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.950" end="00:50:23.270" style="s2">Tory can kind of track your learning and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.750" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">just like in video games where they have</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.270" end="00:50:27.230" style="s2">the lesson tree you know once you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:28.490" style="s2">algebra they can go to trigonometry and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.230" end="00:50:30.560" style="s2">stuff like that you can check them off</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.490" end="00:50:31.910" style="s2">and and you can show other people trees</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.560" end="00:50:34.010" style="s2">and that&#39;d be great because then if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.910" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">need someone that knows how to do social</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.010" end="00:50:38.840" style="s2">media I could just do a search and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:43.610" style="s2">people that have gone through the social</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.840" end="00:50:44.840" style="s2">media courses would pop up anyways so</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.610" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea I&#39;ve been rumbling</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.840" end="00:50:48.110" style="s2">around the background it&#39;s very similar</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:51.170" style="s2">or similar people been talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.110" end="00:50:54.320" style="s2">same thing didn&#39;t the education one the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.170" end="00:50:56.810" style="s2">first solution raising my maturity there</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.320" end="00:51:01.340" style="s2">was a podcast recently I think on level</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.810" end="00:51:05.000" style="s2">wisdom including ju-yeol and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.340" end="00:51:08.450" style="s2">he said something I need to listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.000" end="00:51:12.560" style="s2">again but it was something about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.450" end="00:51:16.540" style="s2">hammer of Thor mean that one tool that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.560" end="00:51:20.300" style="s2">only that no one can basically lift up</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.540" end="00:51:23.420" style="s2">but there is one person who can and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.300" end="00:51:28.570" style="s2">the idea was that everyone has its own</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.420" end="00:51:32.470" style="s2">like hammer and the only thing that only</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.570" end="00:51:37.570" style="s2">they can do and discovering that</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.470" end="00:51:44.900" style="s2">potential and that not destiny maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.570" end="00:51:46.480" style="s2">yeah discovering that who who I am</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.900" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">it sounded like something like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.480" end="00:51:53.030" style="s2">discovering my own orbit and yeah being</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:55.790" style="s2">able to find that that hammer that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.030" end="00:52:00.200" style="s2">belongs to me and only I am able to lift</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.790" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">it up and use it that&#39;s that sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.200" end="00:52:07.370" style="s2">like lucky what you said ah it&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:13.940" style="s2">application or a tool that helps people</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.370" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">to find the place yeah yeah I wind it</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.940" end="00:52:17.990" style="s2">the idea there only being one or only</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:19.250" style="s2">one person can pick it up but I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.990" end="00:52:20.900" style="s2">there&#39;s like hammers lying everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.250" end="00:52:23.750" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot foam that no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.900" end="00:52:25.580" style="s2">picking up and some people can pick up</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.750" end="00:52:27.710" style="s2">pick up that hammer better and more</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.580" end="00:52:30.350" style="s2">easily than other people so it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.710" end="00:52:31.910" style="s2">an efficiency thing but I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.350" end="00:52:33.890" style="s2">times when people say by one way like</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.910" end="00:52:36.290" style="s2">this is the one love of my life this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.890" end="00:52:39.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like no there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.290" end="00:52:42.440" style="s2">them some are easier let&#39;s find the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.350" end="00:52:44.510" style="s2">efficient for you and in it and it can</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.440" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">change and you know in another year you</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.510" end="00:52:48.170" style="s2">may grow and there may be some other way</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:50.450" style="s2">that you can really help the society but</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.170" end="00:52:53.810" style="s2">yeah I think a tool that says how can we</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.450" end="00:52:57.050" style="s2">take this one person and a m&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.810" end="00:52:59.360" style="s2">society the most efficient way and just</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.050" end="00:53:01.250" style="s2">make the world better for everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.360" end="00:53:03.470" style="s2">then if we did that for a large number</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.250" end="00:53:05.000" style="s2">of people or made a resources for</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.470" end="00:53:08.660" style="s2">everyone to where they can be their most</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.000" end="00:53:12.590" style="s2">efficient and happiest that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.660" end="00:53:14.750" style="s2">amazing be together attack right there</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.590" end="00:53:17.960" style="s2">look at that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.750" end="00:53:19.819" style="s2">my five questions of like Who am I for</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.960" end="00:53:21.740" style="s2">my people what is my purpose what do I</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.819" end="00:53:23.660" style="s2">need and then what am I willing to let</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.740" end="00:53:25.369" style="s2">go of I don&#39;t it does not feel my</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.660" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">umbrella but like something like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.369" end="00:53:26.930" style="s2">where it&#39;s like you wanna know who you</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:28.339" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.930" end="00:53:30.230" style="s2">follow this path you want to know who</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.339" end="00:53:32.119" style="s2">your people are use these tools you want</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.230" end="00:53:35.030" style="s2">to know and where and then creating the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.119" end="00:53:36.109" style="s2">tool that does all of those things your</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.030" end="00:53:39.740" style="s2">hammer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.109" end="00:53:42.589" style="s2">we&#39;re circling around that idea together</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.740" end="00:53:46.940" style="s2">if you wants to know who are call me at</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.589" end="00:53:48.260" style="s2">4:00 a.m. in the morning well you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.940" end="00:53:53.660" style="s2">probably tell us where to go if it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.000" end="00:54:03.490" style="s2">surgery but that&#39;s a different story</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.910" end="00:54:08.599" style="s2">agenda which was just I mean this might</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.130" end="00:54:09.050" style="s2">be a better thing to do eight for two</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.599" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">weeks</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.050" end="00:54:14.690" style="s2">once we may be played with the calendar</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:16.579" style="s2">piece is we talked about doing every</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.290" end="00:54:26.780" style="s2">Aussies and New Zealanders can you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.950" end="00:54:28.220" style="s2">come in and do it when it&#39;s not except</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.780" end="00:54:30.980" style="s2">she said this at 9 a.m. this one is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.220" end="00:54:32.900" style="s2">little more do a hole for them even</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.980" end="00:54:36.020" style="s2">though it&#39;s ridiculously early like 9</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.900" end="00:54:38.089" style="s2">a.m. is a ridiculous time so um just</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.020" end="00:54:39.650" style="s2">wanted to reap ring it up if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.089" end="00:54:42.829" style="s2">would be open to doing the 2 p.m. one I</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.650" end="00:54:45.980" style="s2">know I&#39;m not as on 2 p.m. as I can be in</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.829" end="00:54:48.369" style="s2">the morning but yeah I mean that would</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.980" end="00:54:52.609" style="s2">hopefully be on the weekend but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.369" end="00:54:54.260" style="s2">yeah Oh God I&#39;m happy moving one or two</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.609" end="00:54:59.869" style="s2">that way I&#39;d like to double-check make</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.260" end="00:55:02.450" style="s2">sure someone will show up so we can just</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.869" end="00:55:05.690" style="s2">ask also in the project space right like</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.450" end="00:55:08.210" style="s2">if we handed it to be like an 11 12 1 to</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.690" end="00:55:11.050" style="s2">5 hours later the normal who would show</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.210" end="00:55:13.220" style="s2">up for that on a regular basis who would</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.050" end="00:55:16.460" style="s2">calendar told does that have some sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.220" end="00:55:18.710" style="s2">of a sign up it&#39;s got him yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.460" end="00:55:20.450" style="s2">cannot see as I said you can just look</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.710" end="00:55:23.359" style="s2">at it or you can actually sign up and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.450" end="00:55:25.550" style="s2">then ads but it&#39;s also a poor work the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.359" end="00:55:28.190" style="s2">water set off I&#39;ve got all the different</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.550" end="00:55:28.549" style="s2">time zones on it because it didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.190" end="00:55:30.769" style="s2">to just</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.549" end="00:55:32.929" style="s2">so like just for the pond so I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.769" end="00:55:35.059" style="s2">whatever you sign up it will show you in</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.929" end="00:55:44.209" style="s2">your country what time that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.059" end="00:55:48.049" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s okay in projects yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.209" end="00:55:49.689" style="s2">will do um yeah so that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.049" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">meaning so like the viscosity</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.689" end="00:55:55.880" style="s2">roundtables always same time and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:58.670" style="s2">board meetings every other with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.880" end="00:56:02.329" style="s2">cuffs and the links are always the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.670" end="00:56:04.609" style="s2">links for every single one of them but</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.329" end="00:56:05.599" style="s2">no new link for every single one of them</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.609" end="00:56:07.910" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.599" end="00:56:10.789" style="s2">oh it&#39;s a new link so so would you want</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.910" end="00:56:13.609" style="s2">me to just pour this is what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.789" end="00:56:15.679" style="s2">this is what time and because if someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.609" end="00:56:19.099" style="s2">what looks a like if you wanted to send</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.679" end="00:56:22.819" style="s2">the calendar to Kylie dice and she just</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.099" end="00:56:25.670" style="s2">looks at the calendar and how would we</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.819" end="00:56:28.670" style="s2">tell her which way you know you said the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.670" end="00:56:31.339" style="s2">different links every time if dude up a</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.670" end="00:56:34.939" style="s2">same link is it only chance of getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.339" end="00:56:37.189" style="s2">the same link for them or just so I can</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.939" end="00:56:39.170" style="s2">use my zoom but then we&#39;d be using my</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.189" end="00:56:41.479" style="s2">zoom we wouldn&#39;t be live and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.170" end="00:56:43.219" style="s2">of the point of the round tables and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.479" end="00:56:44.630" style="s2">these theoretically people are watching</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.219" end="00:56:48.289" style="s2">and know that we exist and come be part</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.630" end="00:56:51.170" style="s2">of it but I still feel I&#39;m gonna put it</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.289" end="00:56:55.689" style="s2">on my to do this I do have a paid zoom</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.170" end="00:56:58.789" style="s2">account and it does allow sharing</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.689" end="00:57:00.920" style="s2">streaming to Facebook and YouTube I</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.789" end="00:57:03.799" style="s2">think I haven&#39;t done it yet but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.920" end="00:57:05.449" style="s2">it&#39;s on the option the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.799" end="00:57:07.630" style="s2">having a consistent link posted on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.449" end="00:57:10.279" style="s2">internet is that you will get</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.630" end="00:57:13.609" style="s2">thirteen-year-olds right okay ugly</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.279" end="00:57:16.429" style="s2">things on there so there&#39;s that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.609" end="00:57:18.319" style="s2">know a good solution on that except you</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.429" end="00:57:21.289" style="s2">could they have the waiting room and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.319" end="00:57:22.699" style="s2">could only let in people that yeah cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.289" end="00:57:26.059" style="s2">was just wondering so that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.699" end="00:57:27.400" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t on Facebook maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.059" end="00:57:30.019" style="s2">know I mean they might want to come in</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.400" end="00:57:32.539" style="s2">join or whatever of this they have no</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.019" end="00:57:34.519" style="s2">time for whatever and if you send in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.539" end="00:57:37.579" style="s2">milling to the calendar they&#39;re wanting</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.519" end="00:57:39.799" style="s2">to know when the links going off and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.579" end="00:57:42.049" style="s2">link goes up a few days in the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.799" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">group you know I mean so I&#39;m just trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.049" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.470" end="00:57:51.220" style="s2">I&#39;m having trouble finding the link in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.720" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">Facebook every yeah yeah doesn&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.220" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if do you believe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:02.900" style="s2">putting the link somewhere and then Kari</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:05.900" style="s2">can put it in the calendar or if someone</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.900" end="00:58:07.940" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t mind maintaining the events I</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.900" end="00:58:10.370" style="s2">know for Jubilee it&#39;s a pain to create</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.940" end="00:58:11.750" style="s2">an event instead of a post but then you</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.370" end="00:58:13.310" style="s2">could always just hit the events thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.750" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">and but then we&#39;re still maintaining a</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.310" end="00:58:15.860" style="s2">few calendars right when we create</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:18.110" style="s2">stream yard</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.860" end="00:58:19.700" style="s2">it creates the posting and so then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.110" end="00:58:21.890" style="s2">you have to like also then create an</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.700" end="00:58:24.400" style="s2">event and every of every one would have</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.890" end="00:58:28.010" style="s2">a double I would have the event</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:30.860" style="s2">broadcast and so it&#39;s just for that or</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.010" end="00:58:34.280" style="s2">we actually go live to Facebook right</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.860" end="00:58:36.890" style="s2">it&#39;s even more weird than with like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.280" end="00:58:39.560" style="s2">solution it&#39;s easier for people to find</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.890" end="00:58:41.750" style="s2">events yeah it should be nice yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.560" end="00:58:44.630" style="s2">wonder if you could create a link to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.750" end="00:58:45.830" style="s2">Facebook search before I might play</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.630" end="00:58:48.820" style="s2">around and see if I can figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.830" end="00:58:52.910" style="s2">link that&#39;ll always pull up the latest</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.820" end="00:58:54.320" style="s2">one mm-hmm we could post that link</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.910" end="00:58:56.420" style="s2">everywhere and then it would take them</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.320" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">it would search Facebook for that I know</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.420" end="00:58:59.390" style="s2">the Facebook search sucks I&#39;ll play</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:02.270" style="s2">round see if I can figure out a way to</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.390" end="00:59:03.980" style="s2">do that yes the other option we talked</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.270" end="00:59:06.200" style="s2">about before Brett and I didn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.980" end="00:59:08.660" style="s2">research it is something like a bitly</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.200" end="00:59:10.940" style="s2">which bitly does not have this but where</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.660" end="00:59:12.590" style="s2">we have the same URL but we change the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.940" end="00:59:13.850" style="s2">backend right so every week we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.590" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">putting our new stream yard but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.850" end="00:59:19.220" style="s2">following the same length every week we</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:21.890" style="s2">are doing the backend changing it out</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.220" end="00:59:23.600" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if that exists Italy</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.890" end="00:59:25.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have it at least I sound like</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.600" end="00:59:27.470" style="s2">that would have the same problem as just</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.010" end="00:59:29.270" style="s2">having the static link where if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.470" end="00:59:29.720" style="s2">you know if a 13 year old or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.270" end="00:59:32.390" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.720" end="00:59:36.080" style="s2">mm-hmm with nefarious purposes wanted to</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.779" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">that you know like how do we coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.160" end="01:01:30.769" style="s2">this I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:32.119" style="s2">might help if we get the calendar tool</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.769" end="01:01:33.469" style="s2">online we might be able to put the links</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.119" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">there and then just say go there and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.469" end="01:01:38.359" style="s2">can you can see that stuff which that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:40.160" style="s2">something that like if the natural took</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.359" end="01:01:42.229" style="s2">off that&#39;s something that was built in</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.160" end="01:01:43.809" style="s2">its people who were RSVP to the event</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.229" end="01:01:45.619" style="s2">could see the URL people who weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.809" end="01:01:47.689" style="s2">couldn&#39;t so you could see what time it</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.619" end="01:01:51.499" style="s2">was but only once you&#39;d signed up for it</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.689" end="01:01:53.449" style="s2">you could actually see the the link but</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.499" end="01:01:56.059" style="s2">that&#39;s harder to set up and manage with</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.449" end="01:01:58.099" style="s2">neck so I mean if this calendar tool is</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.059" end="01:01:59.660" style="s2">easier to use for that that might be a</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.099" end="01:02:01.339" style="s2">better way to do to to approach a</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.660" end="01:02:04.369" style="s2">calendar tool looks like they charge</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.339" end="01:02:07.939" style="s2">they have their scaled pricing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.369" end="01:02:09.690" style="s2">not per person so it is like 20 bucks a</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.939" end="01:02:12.870" style="s2">month but overall and some</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.690" end="01:02:15.000" style="s2">something maybe like a second to your</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.870" end="01:02:17.610" style="s2">one but they offer free for three months</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.000" end="01:02:19.140" style="s2">if we&#39;re wanting to use that right now</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.610" end="01:02:20.460" style="s2">we can use the free one until we figure</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.140" end="01:02:22.440" style="s2">out what a lot of you for it but if it</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.460" end="01:02:24.780" style="s2">is the thing that encompasses everything</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.440" end="01:02:26.690" style="s2">we need to get people to our stuff then</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.780" end="01:02:30.960" style="s2">20 bucks a month seems like an okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.690" end="01:02:33.710" style="s2">totally alright goodbye YouTube and</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.960" end="01:02:33.710" style="s2">Facebook see you tomorrow morning</p>
