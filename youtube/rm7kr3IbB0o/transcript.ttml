<p begin="00:00:01.599" end="00:00:04.799" style="s2">rebel wisdom released a video a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.080" end="00:00:07.279" style="s2">days ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.799" end="00:00:08.080" style="s2">called the council god and in it they</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.279" end="00:00:09.679" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.080" end="00:00:11.360" style="s2">this idea that council culture is</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.679" end="00:00:13.679" style="s2">looking to cancel everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.360" end="00:00:14.719" style="s2">you everyone doesn&#39;t matter how woke you</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.679" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">are because there&#39;s gonna be a tiny bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.719" end="00:00:18.400" style="s2">of you that&#39;s not woke that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:20.080" style="s2">doing is we&#39;re reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.400" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">our shadow and other people and trying</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.080" end="00:00:22.880" style="s2">to cancel it when of course you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s in you</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.880" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">it&#39;s everywhere it&#39;s like literally</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">trying to cancel your shadow</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:31.359" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it so in the comments of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:33.680" style="s2">their video someone mentioned how</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.359" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">this canceled god reminds them of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.680" end="00:00:38.800" style="s2">nothing from the neverending story</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">and so i got to thinking there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:43.040" style="s2">reason i&#39;m bringing that up</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">i got to thinking about what does the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.040" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">opposite of cancel culture look like</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">what does creation culture look like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">culture where everyone can try</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:56.239" style="s2">and everyone succeeds to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:58.000" style="s2">they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">and they keep they keep improving their</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.000" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">ideas keep improving</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:03.199" style="s2">that is what creation culture gives us</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">and so i went for this walk and i had</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.199" end="00:01:06.320" style="s2">the thought of the never ending story in</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:09.200" style="s2">my head and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.320" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">this scene at the end when sebastian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.200" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">reading the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:12.880" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t know he&#39;s part of the story</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:15.280" style="s2">he&#39;s just watching the heroes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.880" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">heroines and watching the story unfold</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.280" end="00:01:19.840" style="s2">and the empress is begging for someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">to to do the thing those stories about</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">and she&#39;s crying out you know sebastian</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:25.040" style="s2">say my name and he&#39;s like i can i have</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">to keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.040" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">both feet on the floor i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">acknowledge that this this book</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">isn&#39;t just a book it&#39;s something real</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">and so when he finally gives in and gels</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">his mother&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:38.479" style="s2">out of the window he&#39;s then transported</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">to fantasia</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.479" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">where the empress is sitting with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">last ember of fantasia</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">and he thinks everything&#39;s lost because</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">he failed there&#39;s only one little tiny</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">speck left</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">and she</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">just says you just need to wish fantasia</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">back like just make wish after wish</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">after wish and that will build fantasia</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">and so he brings back the planes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">betray you and and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">our tech and wishes to to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">in the sky on balco and and attack his</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">bullies</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">and this fantasy just being created and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">that to me is creation culture not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">attacking of the bullies and not one</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">person having all the power but</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">realizing you have the power you also</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">have an ember</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">and the more we all have the nothing we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">all the shadow side we all have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">ember which one are you going to focus</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">envision a world wink your wishes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">that is creation culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">what else creation culture is to me is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:33.519" style="s2">the opposite of cancel culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">so in council culture it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">broadcast media</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">even though it&#39;s more distributed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to get a youtube channel</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">with millions of subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">and so therefore anyone could kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">have that happen unlike when someone had</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">to discover you and how that happened</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">for you to become famous you can become</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">youtube famous which actually can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">famous than hollywood famous and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">in that in that it&#39;s become broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like one person</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">and millions of followers which leaves</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">you more susceptible to the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">being canceled</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">as the influencer it&#39;s also i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">videos on all these topics</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">the difference between oxytocin and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">dopamine that being an influencer is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">attracting dopamine all about getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">people to like you and oxytocin&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">about giving love</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like right you don&#39;t feel oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:19.280" style="s2">people love you you feel it when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">love other people</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.280" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">and so a culture of interconnection that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">is that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">distributed where we feel connected</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">where you know you cannot fail</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">not because you can&#39;t get your idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:31.760" style="s2">wrong or you&#39;re not going to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">but you know you&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">canceled over it you know there&#39;s a road</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">to redemption you know that the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve surrounded yourself with will see</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">you for you and everything you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">and allow you to redeem yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a system of redemption</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">that the very big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:48.879" style="s2">council culture which is not voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">right you don&#39;t get to choose to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.879" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">canceled</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">everyone else is and we didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">together decide on the rules for council</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">it&#39;s like did the right people see you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">at the wrong time doing the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">then you&#39;re canceled forever</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s very few roads to redemption</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">to come back</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">so what would creation culture look like</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">have a world where anyone feels that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">they can create something there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">saying that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">or a question the coaches ask which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">like if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">knew you couldn&#39;t fail what would you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">try what would you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">write down jump off a building and fly</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">let me keep i knew i couldn&#39;t fail i</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">can&#39;t fall i&#39;m doing some</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">mystical crap but the truth is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">okay well what does failure mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:31.759" style="s2">is it financial failure isn&#39;t starving</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">to death and not having a roof over your</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.759" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">head is it social failure and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">alone and isolated</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:39.199" style="s2">and together we can solve both of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">things so that no one has to worry</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.199" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">about cancel cancellation equaling death</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">because they don&#39;t worry they can&#39;t feed</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">their family in a roof over their head</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t mean social death either</p>
