<p begin="00:00:11.040" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">been handed down but it also seems that</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.320" end="00:00:17.490" style="s2">there is almost another perspective</p>

<p begin="00:00:17.490" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">time which is an attack on the very</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.590" end="00:00:26.250" style="s2">concept of gender itself people who are</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">knowledgeable about the questions of sex</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.250" end="00:00:33.030" style="s2">and gender as they intersect evolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:34.980" style="s2">are to my knowledge without exception</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.030" end="00:00:37.290" style="s2">interested in being compassionate and</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.059" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">we are not interested in is allowing a</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.100" end="00:00:54.140" style="s2">naive desire to make everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">perfectly identical overwrite the actual</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.140" end="00:01:00.570" style="s2">rules of biology and there are places</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">where this matters a great deal the fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.570" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">that a person may identify as a woman</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">does not necessarily negate the athletic</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:12.990" style="s2">capacity that they have inherited as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:16.790" style="s2">man should we allow people simply by</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.990" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">identifying as women to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.790" end="00:01:22.860" style="s2">women&#39;s sports including fighting should</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.090" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">we allow you after you&#39;ve been convicted</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.860" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">of a crime to identify as a woman and go</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:27.930" style="s2">to a woman&#39;s prison I mean does that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:29.009" style="s2">make sense from the point of view of</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">questions and one thing that concerns me</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:43.250" style="s2">a great deal is it seems to me that a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:46.170" style="s2">great many people get some early</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.250" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">unpleasant experience with science they</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.170" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">decide that they are not scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.090" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">minded which is a tragedy in and of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:55.530" style="s2">itself and they walk away from science</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">and then they start solving problems in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.530" end="00:02:00.210" style="s2">their mind with how the world should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">structured and they do so in an a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">scientific way then they announced their</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">solution having realized well the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">problem can be solved if we simply allow</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">you to tell us whether you&#39;re a man or a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:14.090" style="s2">woman</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">and the result is they have some</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.090" end="00:02:20.220" style="s2">incredibly arbitrary set of cascading</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">effects that stretch off into biology</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.220" end="00:02:24.360" style="s2">classes they stretch off into the law</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:30.110" style="s2">they stretch off into the rules of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.360" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">civilization and these people have no a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.110" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">they have no sense that they have caused</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:37.410" style="s2">a serious problem that the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:38.730" style="s2">solution looked simple to them was only</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.410" end="00:02:40.590" style="s2">the result of the fact that they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.730" end="00:02:43.050" style="s2">looking at an artificially small piece</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.590" end="00:02:44.970" style="s2">of the puzzle and by trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.050" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">that one small piece and letting the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.970" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">chips fall where they may with respect</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">to the rest of the the issue they have</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:56.120" style="s2">made a much worse problem than we had it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">is not difficult to make society</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.120" end="00:03:02.810" style="s2">compassionate to those whose gender is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.430" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">not one of the two most common genders</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.810" end="00:03:09.330" style="s2">it is very difficult to write a solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:11.489" style="s2">that solves every problem all the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.330" end="00:03:13.500" style="s2">with no ambiguity we are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.489" end="00:03:17.160" style="s2">to deal with the fact that if you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.500" end="00:03:19.049" style="s2">born in one sex and you decide at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.160" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">gender level to transition to the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.049" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">sex there are certain things that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:26.070" style="s2">not going to be altered and from then on</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">you are going to be in this third</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.070" end="00:03:29.489" style="s2">category you are going to be somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:31.260" style="s2">who has transitioned rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.489" end="00:03:34.709" style="s2">somebody who has completely jumped the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.260" end="00:03:35.850" style="s2">gap and do you think that there are two</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.709" end="00:03:39.000" style="s2">forces at work here</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.850" end="00:03:42.269" style="s2">because usually with with with most</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.000" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">trans people they they are either a man</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.269" end="00:03:45.180" style="s2">who wants to transition to being a woman</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:48.570" style="s2">or all the nuance to transition to being</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.180" end="00:03:50.430" style="s2">a man but there is also this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.570" end="00:03:52.380" style="s2">seems to me there&#39;s this third force of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.430" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">an attack on the concept of gender</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.380" end="00:03:56.070" style="s2">itself do you think that this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">the same phenomena or do you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.070" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">something different well I have some</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">experience with this evergreen had quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">a number of trans students and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:11.670" style="s2">trans faculty and so although I had</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:13.440" style="s2">never encountered a trans person prior</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.670" end="00:04:15.870" style="s2">to coming to Evergreen by the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.440" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">Heather and I left it had been a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.870" end="00:04:22.680" style="s2">regular experience and it became normal</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:23.190" style="s2">enough in my experience none of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.680" end="00:04:25.170" style="s2">trans be</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.190" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">people I was interacting with were</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.170" end="00:04:30.690" style="s2">aggressively interested in rewriting the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:34.620" style="s2">laws of logic or telling biologists what</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.690" end="00:04:37.410" style="s2">to think they did want to be treated</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.620" end="00:04:40.590" style="s2">with respect and decency and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.410" end="00:04:44.670" style="s2">responded when you did so my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.590" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">that the attack on gender which seems to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.670" end="00:04:50.310" style="s2">focus on trans people is not primarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.650" style="s2">being driven by trans people it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.310" end="00:04:58.470" style="s2">driven by other people who have an</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.650" end="00:05:01.020" style="s2">agenda and trans is the excuse for</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.470" end="00:05:05.130" style="s2">bullying those of us who would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.020" end="00:05:07.560" style="s2">actually biology Trump&#39;s these other</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.130" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">considerations you cannot overwrite the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.560" end="00:05:13.020" style="s2">biology you can make allowances for</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.640" style="s2">deciding to identify this way or that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.020" end="00:05:17.310" style="s2">way but the biology will remain what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.640" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">is so what is that force if that is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.310" end="00:05:26.040" style="s2">different agenda what is that agenda the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:29.790" style="s2">agenda has to do with gaining the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.040" end="00:05:32.130" style="s2">to hard-code solutions into the rules of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.790" end="00:05:34.500" style="s2">civilization without inviting comment</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.130" end="00:05:37.950" style="s2">from experts in relevance which is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.500" end="00:05:40.140" style="s2">balancing pure and simple I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.950" end="00:05:42.840" style="s2">is a power thing I cannot say for sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.140" end="00:05:45.660" style="s2">if it is pure and simple I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.840" end="00:05:47.970" style="s2">how this runs in the mind of people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.660" end="00:05:49.980" style="s2">are pushing this perspective but I do</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.970" end="00:05:53.340" style="s2">believe that whether they understand or</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.980" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">not that their objective is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.340" end="00:05:58.710" style="s2">accumulate power and wield it in their</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:00.630" style="s2">own self-interest that that is in effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.710" end="00:06:03.270" style="s2">what it&#39;s taking place take the trans</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.630" end="00:06:05.550" style="s2">issue as a really good example we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.270" end="00:06:07.560" style="s2">trans people who want to be known by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.550" end="00:06:09.270" style="s2">other gender they want to transition men</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.560" end="00:06:12.180" style="s2">transition to women all in transition to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.270" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2">men but then there&#39;s this also this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.180" end="00:06:15.450" style="s2">sense of a different fourth which is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.800" end="00:06:18.870" style="s2">attack on the whole concept of gender</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.450" end="00:06:21.330" style="s2">itself do you see the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.870" end="00:06:23.430" style="s2">there are these there&#39;s almost two</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.330" end="00:06:25.740" style="s2">different perspectives and two different</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.430" end="00:06:28.140" style="s2">forces at work I would say there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.740" end="00:06:32.100" style="s2">definitely those two and and many more</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.140" end="00:06:33.470" style="s2">as well and but that framing at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.100" end="00:06:40.520" style="s2">those two is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.470" end="00:06:46.690" style="s2">apt for sure and among those who want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.520" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">transition to the other gender there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.690" end="00:06:53.990" style="s2">there are many good kind heart and smart</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.380" end="00:06:56.330" style="s2">people who are in this what must be</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.990" end="00:06:58.580" style="s2">completely miserable position of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.330" end="00:06:59.870" style="s2">that they were and some people who use</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.580" end="00:07:02.150" style="s2">this language of being born in the wrong</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.150" end="00:07:08.930" style="s2">language but you know need to transition</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.970" end="00:07:11.750" style="s2">in order to feel whole and for those</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.930" end="00:07:13.700" style="s2">people we we owe them a society our</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.700" end="00:07:19.640" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t run afoul of what else we</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.920" end="00:07:21.490" style="s2">know to be true and there are a whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.640" end="00:07:24.020" style="s2">lot of other people who seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.490" end="00:07:27.320" style="s2">claiming that but actually seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.020" end="00:07:30.350" style="s2">gaming the system and looking to either</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.320" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">just disrupt things or make some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.350" end="00:07:37.310" style="s2">personal profit so there&#39;s there was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:40.250" style="s2">problem with some number of the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.310" end="00:07:41.960" style="s2">who claim to be trans</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.250" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">who actually look like they are not</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.960" end="00:07:50.870" style="s2">really playing in good faith at all as</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:56.780" style="s2">for the other so all these people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.870" end="00:08:00.860" style="s2">are claiming their 84 genders and using</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.780" end="00:08:03.080" style="s2">as evidence that I can&#39;t even remember</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.860" end="00:08:08.330" style="s2">what you know two or three cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.080" end="00:08:13.130" style="s2">names for a third gender this is more</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.330" end="00:08:16.780" style="s2">baffling actually and it&#39;s it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.130" end="00:08:21.530" style="s2">more sort of standard authoritarian left</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.780" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">stuff where they come up some something</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.530" end="00:08:25.610" style="s2">has been generated that actually has no</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:29.540" style="s2">relationship with reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.610" end="00:08:31.880" style="s2">and some very small fringe group is just</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.540" end="00:08:33.080" style="s2">claiming you know what it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.880" end="00:08:35.300" style="s2">chant you know gender isn&#39;t a thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.080" end="00:08:36.469" style="s2">which is then forced a number of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.300" end="00:08:37.940" style="s2">good people who didn&#39;t even want to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.469" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">talking about this to say well you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.940" end="00:08:42.400" style="s2">what gender is just a made-up thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:46.170" style="s2">anyway we&#39;re only talking about sex and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.400" end="00:08:51.240" style="s2">I would say you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.170" end="00:08:54.089" style="s2">is real and in animals it is very close</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.240" end="00:08:57.990" style="s2">to a binary what kind of gamete do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.089" end="00:09:00.149" style="s2">produce is it small and mobile and has</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.990" end="00:09:03.959" style="s2">almost no muscle cell machinery</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.149" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">whatsoever then your male and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.959" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">large and has all the cytoplasm</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">including the mitochondria and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.190" style="s2">really move much than your female</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.320" style="s2">there&#39;s new research out I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.190" end="00:09:16.410" style="s2">actually just this week providing</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.320" end="00:09:19.110" style="s2">evidence yet again that actually yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.410" end="00:09:21.329" style="s2">male brains and female brains have</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.110" end="00:09:22.890" style="s2">differences now that there isn&#39;t a ton</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.329" end="00:09:24.510" style="s2">of overlap we&#39;re not talking about male</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.890" end="00:09:26.279" style="s2">brains over here they all look like this</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.510" end="00:09:27.630" style="s2">only and evarin female brains over here</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.279" end="00:09:29.339" style="s2">they all look like this only and ever</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.630" end="00:09:31.320" style="s2">these are popular these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.339" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">distributions widely overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.320" end="00:09:35.550" style="s2">distributions but on average you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:39.720" style="s2">tell researchers who do this work can</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.550" end="00:09:43.350" style="s2">tell the difference so what is gender in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.720" end="00:09:47.760" style="s2">non-human biology we would call it sex</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.350" end="00:09:50.910" style="s2">roll so you have sex roles in sex</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:54.360" style="s2">switching we fish where they do entirely</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.910" end="00:09:56.790" style="s2">female stuff until if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.360" end="00:09:59.370" style="s2">dominant female and the male in your</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.790" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">group dies maybe if you&#39;re of the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.370" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">species you can switch and become a male</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:05.310" style="s2">and you actually become a male like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:07.800" style="s2">start producing sperm instead of eggs</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.310" end="00:10:09.690" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got testes and you&#39;ve got all</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.800" end="00:10:11.190" style="s2">the male coloration and further when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.690" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">start behaving like a male</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.190" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">so the behaving like a male part that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:17.670" style="s2">the sex role that&#39;s what we would call</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:20.459" style="s2">gender so no gender isn&#39;t a human</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.670" end="00:10:22.050" style="s2">construct it&#39;s not it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.459" end="00:10:26.269" style="s2">that we created just for us it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.050" end="00:10:29.000" style="s2">behavior that goes along with all of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.269" end="00:10:31.890" style="s2">foundational anatomical physiological</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.000" end="00:10:34.860" style="s2">chromosomal genetic you know stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.890" end="00:10:37.410" style="s2">they came before is it much more fluid</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.860" end="00:10:39.810" style="s2">is it much more variable is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.410" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">especially in modern times with modern</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.810" end="00:10:45.899" style="s2">economies are some of the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:48.750" style="s2">expectations of gender roles outdated</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.899" end="00:10:51.810" style="s2">unnecessary and frankly you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.750" end="00:10:54.290" style="s2">somewhat alarming yes for sure we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.810" end="00:10:57.110" style="s2">throw a bunch of those out but</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.290" end="00:11:00.300" style="s2">pretending that they aren&#39;t based on</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.110" end="00:11:03.630" style="s2">millions of years of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.300" end="00:11:06.780" style="s2">is batshit crazy it&#39;s nuts</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.630" end="00:11:08.610" style="s2">so yeah the the people who are saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.780" end="00:11:10.620" style="s2">there&#39;s 84 genders Jenner isn&#39;t there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.610" end="00:11:12.270" style="s2">no relationship and gender and sex of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.620" end="00:11:14.910" style="s2">course there is and of course there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.270" end="00:11:16.890" style="s2">84 genders and are there as many ways to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.910" end="00:11:19.530" style="s2">express gender as there are humans on</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.890" end="00:11:22.020" style="s2">the planet yes I thought I would sign up</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.530" end="00:11:23.220" style="s2">for but then that&#39;s not useful all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.020" end="00:11:25.460" style="s2">that&#39;s not useful as a category</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.220" end="00:11:28.470" style="s2">categories are about generalization and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.460" end="00:11:30.840" style="s2">categories always have in biology</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.470" end="00:11:32.130" style="s2">categories have fuzzy boundaries they</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.840" end="00:11:34.830" style="s2">just do that doesn&#39;t render the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.130" end="00:11:36.270" style="s2">categories untrue or meaningless fuzzy</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.830" end="00:11:39.150" style="s2">boundaries being able to point to like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.270" end="00:11:41.220" style="s2">intersects and therefore claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.150" end="00:11:43.290" style="s2">male and female aren&#39;t real things no</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.220" end="00:11:46.680" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s just fuzzy boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.290" end="00:11:49.710" style="s2">because I guess the fear on the left is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.680" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">that if you accept the reality of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.710" end="00:11:54.210" style="s2">binary then you&#39;re accepting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:56.100" style="s2">fixed gender roles you&#39;re or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.210" end="00:11:57.840" style="s2">accepting that that tends to be where</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.100" end="00:11:59.850" style="s2">the conversation breaks down they they</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.840" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">hear that and they think yeah you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.850" end="00:12:02.520" style="s2">to keep me barefoot you want to keep me</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:04.020" style="s2">barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen if</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.520" end="00:12:05.970" style="s2">you&#39;re good if you&#39;re gonna claim that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.020" end="00:12:07.110" style="s2">male and female are real then I know</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.970" end="00:12:11.550" style="s2">what happens next</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.110" end="00:12:12.870" style="s2">and we frankly we see this in the a word</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.550" end="00:12:16.230" style="s2">with an unfortunate history in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.870" end="00:12:19.320" style="s2">context but the hysterical reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.230" end="00:12:21.030" style="s2">Jordan Peterson who is not a misogynist</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.320" end="00:12:22.800" style="s2">and he&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.030" end="00:12:26.760" style="s2">traditionalist but not really that much</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.800" end="00:12:27.750" style="s2">actually and and he&#39;s new he&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.760" end="00:12:30.210" style="s2">not sexist</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.750" end="00:12:33.630" style="s2">there&#39;s just no universe in which that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.210" end="00:12:39.210" style="s2">that is true and yet what he is is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.630" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">unflinching in in claiming in in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.210" end="00:12:43.500" style="s2">looking at the biology and saying yep</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:45.780" style="s2">male and female are real and what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.500" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">male and female traditional roles were</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.780" end="00:12:51.810" style="s2">built on those realities I would say</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:53.610" style="s2">that we can do better than the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.810" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">archetypes and we can you can look</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.610" end="00:12:58.770" style="s2">forward abandoned some of the old myths</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">that we don&#39;t need anymore and that may</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.770" end="00:13:06.410" style="s2">actually be harmful and have even more</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:10.410" style="s2">even more flexible norms around what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.410" end="00:13:12.370" style="s2">what&#39;s acceptable for for male and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.410" end="00:13:16.930" style="s2">female but</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.370" end="00:13:19.540" style="s2">pretend that I mean I&#39;ve said this</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.930" end="00:13:21.250" style="s2">before but I&#39;m sure in this context if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.540" end="00:13:24.310" style="s2">were growing up right now the way I grew</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.250" end="00:13:26.410" style="s2">up I would be someone who&#39;d be labeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.310" end="00:13:28.210" style="s2">me trans because I was a tomboy I was an</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.410" end="00:13:31.180" style="s2">out-and-out tomboy who far preferred</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.210" end="00:13:33.970" style="s2">dirt to dresses and math to spending</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.180" end="00:13:36.250" style="s2">time of museums and oh well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.970" end="00:13:38.470" style="s2">that&#39;s gendered like since when is math</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.250" end="00:13:41.140" style="s2">a male thing that&#39;s not okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.470" end="00:13:43.270" style="s2">yes more men end up choosing</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.140" end="00:13:46.060" style="s2">mathematically intensive careers and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.270" end="00:13:48.460" style="s2">that that is true but you&#39;re now going</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.060" end="00:13:50.920" style="s2">to say that if I as a woman you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.460" end="00:13:53.500" style="s2">from this largely overlapping population</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.920" end="00:13:54.610" style="s2">of interests over in math space because</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.500" end="00:13:56.770" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in math I&#39;m there for</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.610" end="00:13:59.860" style="s2">acting male that&#39;s actually regressive</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.770" end="00:14:01.000" style="s2">and sexist and and backwards and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.860" end="00:14:04.089" style="s2">why I said you&#39;re the authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:06.010" style="s2">leftists are actually the bigots you</p>

<p begin="00:16:48.790" end="00:16:57.420" style="s2">there is an aspect of game theory which</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.630" end="00:17:22.540" style="s2">I think it has to do with the difference</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.700" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">they will say nothing and allow the</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.100" style="s2">they can&#39;t live with cowardice as an</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.900" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">explanation so they will then</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.100" end="00:18:22.419" style="s2">rationalize that the explanation that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:24.429" style="s2">they have allowed to take hold is</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.460" end="00:18:32.250" style="s2">colleges and universities and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.289" end="00:18:35.890" style="s2">are seeing it in a great many places</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.250" end="00:18:37.900" style="s2">including the tech sector people are too</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.890" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">afraid to speak up and having been</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.900" end="00:18:42.340" style="s2">unable to speak up they start lying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:46.150" style="s2">themselves in order to make it feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.340" end="00:18:48.400" style="s2">better and that is causing fiction to</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.929" end="00:19:03.130" style="s2">make of the term patriarchy because it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.450" end="00:19:05.970" style="s2">can easily turn into a conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.130" end="00:19:09.010" style="s2">but also is there not some truth in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.970" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">we have been running society along that</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:17.380" style="s2">time patriarchy is a myth that is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.549" end="00:19:19.539" style="s2">the same thing as saying that there is</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:41.380" style="s2">half their time in female form so at the</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.380" end="00:19:45.940" style="s2">they are ignorant of whether they will</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.209" end="00:22:52.839" style="s2">or the excesses of the left well I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.989" end="00:22:55.999" style="s2">this is actually something of a bum rap</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.339" end="00:23:26.929" style="s2">to pretend that gender is an invention</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.440" end="00:23:31.329" style="s2">of men who wish to oppress women I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.809" end="00:23:49.069" style="s2">elucidate why those arguments are</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.699" end="00:23:51.469" style="s2">incorrect and help people see the</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.919" end="00:23:58.969" style="s2">falls more on one side than the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.929" end="00:24:01.789" style="s2">that&#39;s a result of the fact that that</p>
