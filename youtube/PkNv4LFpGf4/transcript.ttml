<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">that is so against what a university is</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">about so against it I was not taking</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">sides I was presenting both arguments so</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">the thing is about this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:19.030" style="s2">if you&#39;re presenting something like this</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:20.980" style="s2">it you have to think about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.030" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">teaching climate that you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.980" end="00:02:28.690" style="s2">and this is actually these arguments are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:31.150" style="s2">counter to the Canadian Human Rights</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.690" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">Code ever since I know that you talked</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:39.750" style="s2">c16 ever since this past it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">discriminatory to be targeting someone</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:47.620" style="s2">expression so bringing something like</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.010" end="00:02:49.000" style="s2">that up and class not critically and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.620" end="00:02:50.980" style="s2">understand that you&#39;re trying to like it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.000" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2">was critical why I introduced it</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.980" end="00:02:55.930" style="s2">critically how so like I said like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">said I it was in the spirit of debate</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.930" end="00:03:01.240" style="s2">okay in the spirit of the debate is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:03.550" style="s2">slightly different than being like okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.240" end="00:03:05.709" style="s2">this is this is like a problematic idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.550" end="00:03:07.990" style="s2">that we won make me wanna unpack but</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.709" end="00:03:09.820" style="s2">that&#39;s taking sides it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.990" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">taking sides for me to be like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.820" end="00:03:12.700" style="s2">at this guy like everything that comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:15.850" style="s2">out his mouth is BS but we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.700" end="00:03:17.739" style="s2">watch anyway okay so I understand the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.850" end="00:03:21.130" style="s2">position they are coming from and your</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.739" end="00:03:25.180" style="s2">positionality but the reality is that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.130" end="00:03:27.400" style="s2">has created a toxic climate or some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.180" end="00:03:31.239" style="s2">the students hey you know how many it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.400" end="00:03:35.380" style="s2">great oh how many okay one yeah it might</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.239" end="00:03:37.510" style="s2">be I know I have no concept of of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.380" end="00:03:38.860" style="s2">how many people complain like what their</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.510" end="00:03:41.860" style="s2">complaint was you haven&#39;t showed me the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.860" end="00:03:43.570" style="s2">complaint yes I understand that this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.860" end="00:03:46.360" style="s2">upsetting but there&#39;s also confidential</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.570" end="00:03:48.820" style="s2">at comfy and confidentiality matters the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.360" end="00:03:50.950" style="s2">number of people special yes although</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.820" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">the university apologized publicly for</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.950" end="00:03:53.739" style="s2">its treatment of Shepard as did rambu</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:55.750" style="s2">Khanna</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.739" end="00:03:58.540" style="s2">it is not clear at all that the powers</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.750" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">that be so to speak learned their lesson</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.540" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">and the mistreatment of Shepard not only</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:06.940" style="s2">continued but arguably intensified so</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:08.500" style="s2">she decided to press her case legally</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.940" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">and presented a statement of claim</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.500" end="00:04:13.299" style="s2">against the three and wilfred laurier</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:16.359" style="s2">early in the second week of June it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.299" end="00:04:18.040" style="s2">lists in painful detail the many ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.359" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">that this situation was mishandled</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.040" end="00:04:23.979" style="s2">during and after the initial Inquisition</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:26.650" style="s2">I also discussed the situation with</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.979" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">Howard Levitt Sheppard&#39;s lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.650" end="00:04:30.100" style="s2">I decided that wilfred laurier had</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:32.020" style="s2">learned very little from its public</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.100" end="00:04:34.840" style="s2">embarrassment and that Sheppard&#39;s claims</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.020" end="00:04:37.030" style="s2">were valid justifiable and necessary</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.840" end="00:04:39.610" style="s2">including her statement that her future</p>

<p begin="00:04:39.610" end="00:04:44.620" style="s2">improbable to say the least I&#39;ve been on</p>

<p begin="00:04:44.620" end="00:04:48.430" style="s2">that even than the slightest whiff of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.630" end="00:04:52.330" style="s2">scandal is enough to disqualify a</p>

<p begin="00:04:52.330" end="00:04:56.919" style="s2">decide to read and post the entirety of</p>
