<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">a problem instead in some way like</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">unifies</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">um everything i worry about in</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">philosophy um</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">which is the problem of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">know that you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">um and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.760" style="s2">i asked peter to do this special</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">organization where we would spend</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.760" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">some time just talking about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll talk about some solutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">that i&#39;ve come up with to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">but i&#39;m as interested in the problem as</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">i am in the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">okay the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">like it&#39;s clear that people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">sometimes wrong about stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">we encounter all the time people have</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">false beliefs they&#39;re wrong um</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">so like that&#39;s probably happened to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">right you&#39;ve probably been wrong in fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">you can probably think back</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">on a time when you&#39;re like oh i was</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">wrong about that um so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">a condition that a human being can be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">is to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">but you can&#39;t know you&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">condition you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">experience it right because like you</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">know suppose i&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">about like the weather outside so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">suppose that i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">it&#39;s warm out but it&#39;s actually cold out</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">right it&#39;s like well i don&#39;t think i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s warm out and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">think i&#39;m right about it&#39;s being worn</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">right um now i could go and check right</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">and then i like put my hand down i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:01.439" style="s2">like oh it&#39;s cold and like the second</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">that i correct that that very instant</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">like i</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">like as i feel the cold i&#39;m like oh now</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">i think it&#39;s cold</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m not wrong anymore right um</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">so it&#39;s like i can&#39;t catch myself being</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:14.239" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">um because as soon as i</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.239" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">realize i&#39;m wrong i have the new belief</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">and i&#39;m not wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">right so as soon as i realize i&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">about the weather i i now have what i</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:26.960" style="s2">take to be the correct belief about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">weather</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">one way that philosophers think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">this problem is</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">uh something called moore&#39;s paradox</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">right uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">and moore&#39;s paradox um it&#39;s kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">that you know um</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">you can someone can believe something</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">and that belief can be false right</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">and um so it can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">like you know suppose mike who&#39;s next to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">me on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">zoom is mike believes falsely</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">um that it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">cold right now in chicago okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">can be true</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">and like i can believe it right and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">can say it</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">but there&#39;s one person who can&#39;t say it</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s mike</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">mike can&#39;t say oh it you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s um uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">it&#39;s cold right now in chicago but i</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">right or you know i believe that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">it&#39;s warm out in chicago though it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">i can say that about mike but mike can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">say that about himself even though it</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">can be true</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">so there are true sentences like facts</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">about the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">that are unassertible by</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">certain people namely the people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">they&#39;re about right so that&#39;s what morse</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">and morse fredox is kind of a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">expressing this problem about knowing</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">that you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like there are these unassertible</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">sentences right</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">you can also think of them as</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">unbelievable sentences like i</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">you know mike also can&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">relevant belief he can&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">it&#39;s warm in chicago but i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">that he can&#39;t have that belief</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">right because if he thinks it&#39;s warm in</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">chicago he has that belief okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:10.160" style="s2">but sort of more broadly you know a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.160" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">because you might you know i tried to i</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:15.120" style="s2">tried to impress this paradox on my 16</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.120" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">so what so there are some sentences you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">can&#39;t assert you know whoever promised</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">you you were going to be able to assert</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">all the through sentences um</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">one way to think about it is just to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">think about how much we identify</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">the people around us and these are both</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">people we&#39;re close to but almost kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">maybe like public figures or</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">intellectuals or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">in terms of like the stuff we think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">them as being wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">like there&#39;s a way in which someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:46.400" style="s2">errors almost like define the shape of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">their point of view from your</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">perspective so when you think of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">he&#39;s the person who emphasizes this a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">little too much or like</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">she you know kind of gets this wrong um</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">and and even with people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">close to you can probably pick out</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">you know it&#39;s almost like you pick out</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">their point of view by thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">about what it is that they get a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">but now it&#39;s like oh i can&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">about myself like i can&#39;t pick myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">um so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s disturbing um</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">and um it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">uh it&#39;s like i&#39;m kind of alienated</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">from myself in this way like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">else can</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">know the distinctive character of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">agnes is wrong about except</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:34.319" style="s2">me i can&#39;t know that it&#39;s like i can</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">never know myself and so to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.319" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">like very</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">upsetting um and you know i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:42.639" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">a lot of um</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.639" end="00:07:48.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of talk and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">um let&#39;s almost like bluster that</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.319" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">happens because people can&#39;t deal with</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">this fact and they think that they can</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">solve the problem through a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">um metacognitive detachment like</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">well okay you know you should just you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">should be humble</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">you should um you should always know</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">that you could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t be too certain you should</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:10.840" style="s2">be sort of skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">um don&#39;t be so sure of yourself don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.840" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">overconfident</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">um uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">and like none of that none of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">attempt to take a step back from one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">point of view actually gives you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">the thing that i&#39;m disturbed that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:34.959" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">um which is it&#39;s almost like all of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.959" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">stuff all of that language that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">employ about being skeptical and being</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">distant and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">you know um it&#39;s like uh an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">distance ourselves from our own</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">errors rather than to acknowledge them</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">um it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">do you know this there&#39;s this game where</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">people put their hands like this</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">and you know you would put your hands to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">mind and we push we try to push each</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">other over</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">right and there&#39;s this idea of like um</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">uh i think of the skeptical or</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">non-dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">or self-critical people as the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">who are like really good at pulling</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">their hands away so they never fall over</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh yeah just be really good at</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">detaching just like don&#39;t think anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">you think</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">um and then you&#39;re sort of like safe but</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">that&#39;s like to me that&#39;s like the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">direction it&#39;s not that we should try to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">be safe from being wrong it&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:25.519" style="s2">want to know we want to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">wrong and then know that we&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.519" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">um and like know what we&#39;re wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">concretely like i&#39;m wrong about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the thought i want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">have like is it impossible for me to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">have that thought is am i just</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">tragically faded to never have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">thing that i really want to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">that&#39;s the question so i thought we</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">could start and just talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:42.959" style="s2">question and then i&#39;ll try and talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">about some</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">answers so i&#39;m interested to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">responses and maybe solutions</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">the chat</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">um let&#39;s start us off with rain</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">hi i&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here i was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.440" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">couple minutes</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">late so i have the first question</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">apparently and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">gonna dive in um a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">a ship that&#39;s um on a course</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">is always pointed the wrong direction</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">mm-hmm you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a moment there&#39;s a fraction</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">of a moment where it&#39;s pointed the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">but then it&#39;s the wrong direction so</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">there&#39;s always this course correction</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">um and similarly from an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">cognitive standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">you know if i go to reach for something</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">i&#39;m in a continual embodied feedback</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">loop with my environment</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">in order to constantly course correct so</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not based on</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.800" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">on some kind of static propositions</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">about the world that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">might be right or wrong it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:56.399" style="s2">constant state of wrongness that&#39;s being</p>

<p begin="00:10:56.399" end="00:11:00.320" style="s2">so if one were to generalize that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.320" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">um that could that&#39;s broader than just</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:06.800" style="s2">ships and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">um reaching movements how</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.800" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">does uh the problem that you stated fit</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:13.279" style="s2">in with this kind of view</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">good um so let me give like two</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.279" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">responses so the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">um um anyway i&#39;m not complaining</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">that we&#39;re wrong like i i think we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">wrong about a lot of stuff all the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:25.519" style="s2">and i&#39;m not even trying to solve that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.720" end="00:11:26.880" style="s2">problem you might</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.519" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">you might worry someone might object to</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.880" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">me like why don&#39;t you solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">instead why aren&#39;t you trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">and it&#39;s like no forget about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">problem i&#39;m okay with being wrong i just</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">want to know that i&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">okay so in effect that your point your</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">thought that like well we&#39;re always a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">little bit off like i&#39;m fine with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">but i want to be able to know it</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">i want to be able to be self-aware in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">that moment of going the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing i want you to tell me</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">how i can get um the other thing i want</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">to say is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">you know when i was talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">various hand-wavy metacognitive detached</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">skeptical etc responses to this problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">are essentially ways of telling me like</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">um just stop asserting anything and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">you won&#39;t be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">um uh one of them is like oh everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:08.880" style="s2">always wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">like um there&#39;s another paradox in</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">philosophy called the preface</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">paradox where philosophers will start or</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">not just philosophers would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:16.079" style="s2">start off their book by saying i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s something in this book i&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.079" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">about right</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">that for me that&#39;s like humility on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">cheap you know tell me what you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">about i want to know that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">um so the idea like that i can know in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">general sense that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">wrong about lots of stuff that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">good enough for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">um uh i want to be able to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.839" style="s2">concretely</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">of the specific things that i&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.839" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">you have a follow-up ring</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">no thanks all right uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">heather you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">you could ask it but i will definitely</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:04.399" style="s2">do it um i</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">am wondering what moore&#39;s law says about</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.399" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">um or what</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">comes out of moore&#39;s law in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">just cultivating humility</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">in general as an antidote to that um and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">what i</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">you know whatever you have to say about</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">that i&#39;d love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:24.000" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">humility sadly um humility&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">solution to moore&#39;s paradox um you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">get out of it no matter how humble you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">um i suppose except if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">avoided having any beliefs um</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t have any beliefs then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have any false beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">so um but um</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">uh so then there wouldn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">um on the other hand you still wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">be able to say like there would still be</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:55.519" style="s2">another a truth about you that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">couldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.519" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t sit like there&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">some like</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">uh suppose i were the person with no</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.639" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">beliefs okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">so you guys could say um it&#39;s cold</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">outside but agnes doesn&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">but i can&#39;t say it i don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">beliefs but i also can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">this thing i&#39;m still wrong like because</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">i don&#39;t have this true belief that i</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:20.079" style="s2">should have</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:21.760" style="s2">right so really i can&#39;t you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">around worst paradox even by having no</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.760" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">beliefs because there&#39;s still going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">be these unassertible sentences</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">right that are true about you um about</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">the beliefs that you lack the true</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">beliefs that you lack</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.800" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">um uh and i guess more generally i feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">a little bit like humility goes in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:41.279" style="s2">um uh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">that a lot of what people mean by</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.279" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">humility takes you in the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">direction from the direction i want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">like that&#39;s why i gave that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.639" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">metaphor of pushing the person over</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">like i want to i want to be pushed over</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:54.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to be like really good at</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.839" style="s2">pulling my hands away</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">um so and a lot of the like advice that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.839" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">would lead you to like humility</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">would be ways to avoid error right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">so what i want to say is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">okay yeah great maybe that&#39;s good if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">really want to avoid error if you really</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">care a lot about that but like</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">thing i care about is like being able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">know my errors</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">um and that&#39;s i i think that could also</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">go by the name of humility it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">different kind of humility and so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:25.519" style="s2">like it&#39;s sort of worth distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">two kinds of humility right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.519" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">kind of humility that&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">sort of invulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">where you kind of detach and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">think things so that you won&#39;t be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">um and as i say you&#39;re still not going</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">to avoid certain version of morse</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">paradox</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">but i&#39;m looking for the kind of humility</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:42.720" style="s2">where you don&#39;t detach where you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">commit and you think things and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">wrong and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.000" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">all right um and just</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">stop me ignis if you want to pivot to</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">the second part because we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">bunch of questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">okay uh david north you&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:04.079" style="s2">oh is his mic is not connected okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.079" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">uh read it i wonder what agnes thinks</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">about this issue and the socratic method</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">for an argument sometimes you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">suspend your personal beliefs for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">sake of argument</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">for myself this often means making</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">assertions i think are false but still</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">in the context of the argument if agnes</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">is right about the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">how is the suspension which is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">for argument even possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">yeah good um</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure that what we do when we</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">argue is suspend judgment so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">gets to i&#39;ll talk more about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">socratic</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">part in the second half because that</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">sort of gets to the solution</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">um but like we use this phrase</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">suspension</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">a lot um um</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">like there&#39;s a thing that i do</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">say okay say i&#39;m teaching hume right</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">hume&#39;s a philosopher i don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">with him about a lot of stuff um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">why i picked him</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">um but when i&#39;m teaching hume i try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">become human and like i try to become</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">persuaded by hume and i&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">like you know like i&#39;m i&#39;m trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">the way someone sees it who doesn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">causal connections as like really being</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:17.919" style="s2">there as being in things and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">just a bunch of things following one</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.919" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">another and i&#39;m like i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">trying to inhabit that point and it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">like have i suspended</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">um my my standard beliefs about</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:29.520" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">i&#39;m not even sure what they are like</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.520" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">now i&#39;m hume for a bit um and i in a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">i really believe those things for like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">little while anyways</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">um so i guess i&#39;m less sure that what</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">happens in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">is that we like suspend anything um</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">um maybe um the backdrop here is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">um i think that our beliefs are not very</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:55.200" style="s2">stable</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">and we have an illusion of a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.200" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">belief stability than is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">that is than what is in fact present and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">um there you don&#39;t need to do that much</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">suspending you&#39;re just flip-flopping all</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">right and so i can just be hume for a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">little while because my views about</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">causation aren&#39;t very like well fixed</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">um and so i guess i&#39;m inclined to think</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">what happens in philosophy is more like</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">wavering and also more like sincere</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">belief than like the suspension of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">um uh and why do i think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:28.559" style="s2">well this gets it something that will</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">take us like maybe i may i might not</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.559" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">have time to get into but i think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">of the questions that we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">especially in socratic dialogues right</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">so david referred to surprise dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:41.039" style="s2">questions about justice uh you know what</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">it is to be a good person</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.039" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">what kind of life i want to live</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:50.160" style="s2">those questions are too important to us</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">to suspend judgment on like we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.160" end="00:18:54.799" style="s2">can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">um and that&#39;s actually characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.799" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">a lot of philosophical questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:01.760" style="s2">uh so we we jump to conclusions on those</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">immediately um uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:11.200" style="s2">um uh and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.200" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">that with those questions suspension of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">judgment is an option i can talk more</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:17.039" style="s2">about that but that&#39;s like a that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">a big territory</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.039" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">that i maybe want to wait and see if</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">other people ask about because i would</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">go on at length</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">there&#39;s some cool questions uh rob hart</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">let me scroll back and find it does</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">morris paradox have space for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">unconscious or</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">sort of half conscious intuition that i</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">sometimes feel that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:39.440" style="s2">wrong about something i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">it is yet but like i just know that in</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.440" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">the back of my head something&#39;s calling</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">the alarm and saying you&#39;re wrong check</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">your first principles</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">yeah good um so like</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">um i think one of the ways that we often</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">try to get out of contradictions is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.840" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">sort of like to create a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">distinction or division right um in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">self even right so you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">well i believe p but like a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">there&#39;s like a little voice or a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">like another person</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">um i think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">there&#39;s like kind of like as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">theoretical or conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">question i really wonder to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">those moves make sense like</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">they we verbally we verbally invoke them</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">so as to not be asserting a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:37.039" style="s2">contradiction right so as to not be like</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">i believe this but i don&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.039" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">um and so we&#39;re like a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t believe it right</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">but if we take like the word unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">literally say</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">like freud&#39;s unconscious is unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">right you&#39;re not supposed to be you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:49.280" style="s2">not supposed to be able to like hear</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">what it says</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">so okay we don&#39;t mean unconscious we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">mean i kind of think this thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">also don&#39;t think at the same time um</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">and so like there&#39;s this question what</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.240" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">like what is that and i do</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">think that if you could if you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">come up with a really good theory of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">a really good account of what it would</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">mean to doubt the very thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">um i think that would be the beginnings</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">of a real response</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">um but there&#39;s but you need to do more</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">work than just to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">well there&#39;s this other voice because</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like like one way i could hear</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.960" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">voices is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">i could be like this is weird i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">hearing voices right like</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:30.480" style="s2">like someone else&#39;s voices are in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">head and that&#39;s not what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">about you&#39;re talking about hearing your</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">own voice right you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">like no this is me</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">saying that this is a mistake right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">so like i&#39;m saying it&#39;s not a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">and i&#39;m saying it is a mistake and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:42.799" style="s2">one me</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">right speaking with two voices um</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.799" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">so like one way to hear that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">vacillation right</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like i think it&#39;s right and then a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">second later like no wait a minute and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">then another second later yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">right so temporal vacillation is one way</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">like get the logic clean there but if</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">you have temporal vacillation you</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">haven&#39;t solved my problem right because</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like you always think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">at any given moment it&#39;s just that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">keep changing your mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">and so what you need in order to really</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">get a grip on the problem is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">that simultaneously you could have this</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">it would be your voice it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:16.400" style="s2">you know it wouldn&#39;t be like i&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">voices right</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:27.120" style="s2">your voice um uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">and um and you would</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.120" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">you know you would take it seriously but</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:33.360" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t represent</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">sort of you know your like main view</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.360" end="00:22:38.799" style="s2">right so i i guess what yeah what i want</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">to say is like that&#39;s that&#39;s promising</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.799" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">maybe you could get it to work</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">um that would be the kind of thing like</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what we mean by a solution is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">there&#39;s two good questions i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">flag uh ryan you got a question on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">i&#39;ll post it below for you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">okay yourself yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">i mean this doesn&#39;t solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">but if you kind of expand to collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:13.919" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">do you minimize the problem because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.919" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">chance of me and you both being right is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">wrong as less than the chance of just</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">myself being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">so i think that uh if</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">a lot of people agree with me</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">about some proposition</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">then um the chances</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">that then it&#39;s reasonable especially if</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like an empirical proposition</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">then like it&#39;s reasonable for me to</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">we&#39;re probably correct or something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:03.919" style="s2">that like that it&#39;s unlikely that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:04.960" style="s2">wrong about that one on the other hand i</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.919" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">still might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.960" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">right a lot of people can agree and be</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">wrong and then it would be like extra</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">so that kind of um uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">but like that doesn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">i suppose it doesn&#39;t really help because</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">what what that might help you with is</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">um you know identifying zones of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">relative safety</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">like i&#39;m relatively safe on this one</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">because a lot of people agree with me</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">but suppose i want to know what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">wrong about right</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">well maybe i should gravitate towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">the the ones where a few people agree</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">with me</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">but i have that i have views that few</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">people agree with me about</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">and i think those views are true i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">i&#39;m right about those things</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t have those views if i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">think they were true right</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">so um it&#39;s not like i can go over to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">where my view isn&#39;t shared by many</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">people and be like oh that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">wrong about because if i thought i was</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">wrong about that i would just change my</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:01.840" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">and so you know i feel like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">about like um collective you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">the group agreement is really more like</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">in the domain of that kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:12.960" style="s2">metacognitive take a step back and be</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.400" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">like oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.960" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">if i&#39;m wrong about anything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">probably one of these ones that few</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">people agree with me about</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">by contrast with one of these ones that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:21.039" style="s2">a lot of people agree with me about but</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i&#39;m wrong about any of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.039" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">if i did i wouldn&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">cool um aj you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">um hey jake yeah so hi</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">um so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">kind of still sympathetic to your 16</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:47.520" style="s2">year old&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">initial reaction that you reported at</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.520" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">um like i&#39;m i&#39;m still having like a hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">time seeing why we should</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:57.039" style="s2">be so worried about this like it it</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">seems to me like</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.039" end="00:26:03.760" style="s2">you can accept the considerations</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">that give rise to this situation that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.760" end="00:26:06.640" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">know that we&#39;re wrong while we&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.640" end="00:26:10.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">still like be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.720" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">like okay i was wrong right up to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">very instant where i</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">realized that i used to be wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">that seems like enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">to be able to like um</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">enable us to engage in like practices of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:32.320" style="s2">and so on um and like i think you raised</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">a worry</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.320" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">um towards the beginning of your like</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">initial remarks</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">about self-knowledge um</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">but i guess i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s um like it&#39;s hard for me to feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.279" style="s2">force of that like like i think the um</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">the like</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.279" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">identifying other people by their errors</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">is sort of a disordered practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">that is bad like like i do it too but</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">um i i think it&#39;s like probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">fortunate that we don&#39;t like identify</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">ourselves in that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">um so like yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">i would be interested you could maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">just like say a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">to like rebut um</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">like quietest like arguments for not</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">worrying about the issue yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">good i&#39;m not sure i&#39;ll have enough to</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">satisfy you but</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">so one thing is like</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">um i guess it&#39;s like being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">is one of the fundamental human</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">and yet i don&#39;t get to undergo it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">like um like you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">sort of arguably like the the the main</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">kind of like um</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">what makes a person a person is that she</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">has a power to represent the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">right so we have each of us has this</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">like picture of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">the world like that we take around with</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">us everywhere we go</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">um like if you didn&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">people have that that everyone has in</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.960" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">their head a kind of map of reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">right you would not understand people</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">because that&#39;s like a really deep fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">about people</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">um but all of us are</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">you know mismapping reality in a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">of different ways right</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">and those distortions like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">the distortions in my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">those are just as much a part of me as</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">the perspective itself and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">they they um they are what like</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">um make my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">um kind of distinctive and individual i</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">don&#39;t mean they&#39;re the only thing they</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:52.480" style="s2">make an individual right but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.480" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">um they they there&#39;s a reason why they</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">serve to individuate</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">me to other people and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">this map that i have of the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">like it has these proper it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">me in some sense it has these properties</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">that i&#39;m not able to like be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m you know it&#39;s like a part of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">life is going unlived by me</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">um and i i want to agree with you aj</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">even if that part of my life always went</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">unlived by me</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">i could still engage in practices of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">correction and stuff like to improve the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">map</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:35.279" style="s2">right so i don&#39;t want to insist</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">that um being able to be aware of being</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">wrong is somehow essential to going</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">right to coming to go right</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">um it might be for some questions i</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">think it is but but for many questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:47.120" style="s2">it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">so but i just have like an independent</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.120" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">desire to sort of know this</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">um and so i guess i think like</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">you know the identifying people by their</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">errors it isn&#39;t just like we&#39;re negative</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">and we like to be critical of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">it&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">um the process of individuation right</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">like if you just saw</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">the map of reality as being identical to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:10.240" style="s2">reality that wouldn&#39;t individuate anyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">right um everyone has their own bit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.240" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">it and that&#39;s like that&#39;s what makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">them distinctive and yet for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:16.559" style="s2">i like conflate in some way my map of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:17.039" style="s2">reality with reality it&#39;s like so i</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.559" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.039" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">see myself um so it&#39;s that kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">the kind of self-knowledge i guess that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">i&#39;m looking for that i think is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">and important</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">um and i think of it as intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:32.559" style="s2">valuable</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">and you know you might think um</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.559" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">maybe maybe an analogy might be like</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">there are certain pains of loss the loss</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">of a loved one</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:48.799" style="s2">the end of a relationship right where</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">you feel this hurt of losing something</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.799" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">that was valuable to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:54.240" style="s2">and you might not want to not feel that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.240" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">you like feeling that feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">you&#39;re missing this thing that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">good and valuable to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">is like really important human</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">experience right</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">um you wouldn&#39;t take a pill to make</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">your the pain of mourning go away</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">under circumcision certainly as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:15.360" style="s2">might but you wouldn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">necessarily take it right</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.360" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">experience that you it&#39;s part of what it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">is to be you that that loss is really</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">happening and you want</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">to have like the kind of awareness part</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.519" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">to yourself and so i&#39;m saying i want</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">that with being wrong i want the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">awareness part</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">um and um you know so it&#39;s like i feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">like i&#39;m being forced to take that pill</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">the pill where i don&#39;t feel it and even</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">if it would be painful i would want it</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">um maybe we should go up should we what</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">do you think peter should we take maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">one more question and then go on to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">second part</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">uh yeah um i i have a question that kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">uh could piggyback what aj just said um</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:57.919" style="s2">about like how seeing it may not be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.919" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">um so that whole kind of like problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">that this is just a given</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">of human you know existence and then we</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">have to rely on</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">corrective mechanisms like the socratic</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.600" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">method um</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">to kind of divide the epistemic labor um</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">but also kind of like what we do here in</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">stowe we engage in all these kind of we</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">space intersubjective practices so</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">what&#39;s your thoughts on the extension of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">the sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">in order to respond to this issue yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">so that that really does get to my</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">um solutions so i&#39;ll quickly</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">give you my old solution which i still</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">think is</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">you can solve this problem in more than</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:40.159" style="s2">one way right um</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:42.559" style="s2">so uh and then i&#39;ll give you the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">solution i&#39;m working on now so my first</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.559" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">book is called aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s about like the process of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">trying to become a better person</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">but better in some concrete way like</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">better at appreciating classical music</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.799" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">a better parent or a better student or</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">um you know um</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">um yeah better at like a sport right</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">um so you know but specifically where</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">part of what it means to become better</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">is to more</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">fully grasp the domain of value</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">that is that you know that domain right</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">like really coming to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">what it is for something to be well done</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">in the domain of say</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">sports or something like that okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">the book is about that process and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">what i argue is that when you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:37.120" style="s2">underway</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">like and you&#39;re sort of coming to</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">appreciate it more and more</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">then you kind of know that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">fully appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">right you you can see that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:49.840" style="s2">missing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.559" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">and so and some of the way that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.840" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">shows up</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">is you feel kind of bad about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">um you know you&#39;re you&#39;re like listening</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:57.919" style="s2">to classical music but you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">getting distracted every like three</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.919" end="00:34:01.919" style="s2">minutes because it&#39;s kind of boring</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">and you but you&#39;re like yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">not boring</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">actually i&#39;m the one who&#39;s screwed up</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.360" end="00:34:10.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not appreciating it like</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">i&#39;m failing to grasp the value that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.000" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">really there</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">i think that is a way of realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">it&#39;s not a mistake and belief exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not a super great solution</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">um but it is uh um</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">uh it&#39;s the absence of a belief right</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a belief i should have</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">that i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">um about the value of this thing so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">not that i have a false belief exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s that i fail to have a true one</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">and i can tell that i fail to have it i</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">can tell i&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">something and part of how i can tell i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">missing it is just my sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">that i&#39;m moving myself forward into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">future in which i will have a better</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">grasp</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2">okay that&#39;s like my first book was about</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">this problem only i didn&#39;t put it this</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.280" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">but now i&#39;m interested in and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of diacronic</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a way of saying let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">spread the agent through time and she</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">can look sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">she can look from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">the present into the future and say then</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">in the future i&#39;m gonna fully know</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">and so by thinking in that way she can</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">think to herself in the present i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">fully there&#39;s something wrong with me</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">now i can tell i can feel it</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">she can even feel kind of shame and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">embarrassment um</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:22.640" style="s2">in not getting it right okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">one that&#39;s one way i think we can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.640" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">aware of being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">it&#39;s through aspiration the way i&#39;m and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">i&#39;m happy to entertain questions on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">if you guys have questions thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">but the way i&#39;m interested in right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">it has to do with the socratic method</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">so i think that one way to see the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">socratic method</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:41.440" style="s2">is that like before this presentation i</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">was sitting here in my office and i was</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">thinking through these thoughts right</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">and i was doing it by myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m like oh yeah this is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">persuasive this is a good point you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">talking to myself right</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">uh i&#39;m i am we all are</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:57.040" style="s2">amazing orators of ourselves like when</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">we speak to ourselves we are so easily</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">persuaded</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">right so i&#39;m like oh this is good</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">thinking that i&#39;m doing right</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">um socrates says in the theaters</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">and actually also same similar line jobs</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.880" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">in this office</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">that thinking is like a conversation one</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">has with oneself</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">but like it&#39;s like a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s like just</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">claps every time after you say</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">everything like yeah great</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">and i think that like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">right now what i&#39;m trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">persuade you right so i&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">persuade me anymore</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">um i have a much harder target like i</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">have to convince you guys</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">right that um what right</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">well that you&#39;re doing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">thinking with me right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">like um you&#39;re playing the role of me</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:47.680" style="s2">in the conversation i had with myself</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">right i&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.680" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">taken that slot but speaking to myself</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not speaking to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">and um i think what that means is like</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">together so the subject of the thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">both of us but suppose you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">persuaded</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s me being wrong and i can</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">tell i&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">because you&#39;re not persuaded and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">like no that doesn&#39;t seem right</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:14.320" style="s2">to me and i try another argument right</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">and this gets back to like david&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.320" end="00:37:17.440" style="s2">question about the sort of socratic</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">um and um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">you know um whatever it is that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">trying to persuade you of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.240" style="s2">at that moment i think it even if maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">before i didn&#39;t right um and</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">i am pushing that line i&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">adopting that view for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">argument or something i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">i&#39;m pushing it as hard as i can i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">doing everything i can to think the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:46.079" style="s2">thoughts that i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:46.079" style="s2">and you&#39;re pushing back</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">and that i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">you know you&#39;re arguing against me and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">being unpersuaded by what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">is a way for me to know that i&#39;m wrong i</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">won&#39;t say anything more than that for</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">now because i want to hear your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">about that and i can flush it out in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">thomas uh cleveland you got a question</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.440" end="00:38:17.680" style="s2">yeah you said um that if the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">other person fails to be persuaded that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">means you know you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">isn&#39;t it possible that the other person</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">is wrong and you are right</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">or did i misunderstand you good</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">um there are two different reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.480" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">they might be unpersuaded</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">one um</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:45.359" style="s2">they might be deliberately like not</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:47.119" style="s2">listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.359" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">they might have like bad motives they</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.119" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">might write so sometimes you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">to someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">and you think the reason i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">persuading them</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">is just that like they came into this</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">like they literally had plugs in their</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">ears right they&#39;re not hearing anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">i&#39;m saying or whatever so there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">cases like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.520" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">those are quite rare um uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.760" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">you know and um</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">as long as that&#39;s not happening</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">if i know anything i should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.560" style="s2">teach it to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.560" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">you came into this maybe you were wrong</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">right but if i&#39;m if i if i have</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:26.560" style="s2">knowledge i should be able to give it to</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.560" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">so if i don&#39;t if i can&#39;t give it to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">um even though you&#39;re participating</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">you&#39;re cooperating you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.599" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">and you&#39;re just like no i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:38.960" style="s2">convinced here&#39;s a problem whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.280" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">then that&#39;s on me then that means i</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what i thought i knew</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that my view is false so</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">like um maybe what you&#39;re bringing out</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:48.800" style="s2">here right</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t follow that the view that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.800" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">trying to argue to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">is false but it does follow that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">um if you know something you can teach</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">so um i do think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:05.839" style="s2">um you know we get we at least get that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">far in like</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.839" end="00:40:09.280" style="s2">falling short there&#39;s a great moment in</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">the leki</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">lekies where socrates says has just</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:15.520" style="s2">refuted</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.440" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">leki&#39;s definition of courage as</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.520" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">endurance</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">and he&#39;s about to move on but he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">yeah and maybe courage is endurance</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">let&#39;s move on</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re like wait you just refuted</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">that and he&#39;s like socrates like yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">refuted it</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">what that means is that i showed that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">leki&#39;s didn&#39;t know that but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">mean courage can&#39;t it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">false</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">it just means that leki&#39;s wasn&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">teach it to us</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:38.480" style="s2">right so yeah that&#39;s a fair point that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:41.920" style="s2">all all that i&#39;m doing is experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">my own</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">inability to teach you something</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">just as a second point i&#39;m remain</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.839" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">unpersuaded</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">because it seems possible to me that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">let&#39;s assume that you&#39;re right about</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the best assumption uh and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:06.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">there are defects of nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">or if you want to be more specific there</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">are opinion</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">alternative opinions the person you are</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">is attached to in such a way that no</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">amount of speaking</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">will suffice even if the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">as given are the correct arguments</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">um so i mean you were you were</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">recognizing that as a possibility but it</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">just seems to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:35.119" style="s2">a very live possibility that isn&#39;t due</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">to your failure</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.119" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">i agree so i here&#39;s a way that socrates</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">talks about this he says</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">someone can be a mirror to someone else</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">so when i&#39;m trying to explain something</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">to you you can be a mirror to me</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">and when you&#39;re a mirror it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">let me see these things about myself</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">that otherwise i can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">right and that&#39;s the problem that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">dealing with is that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">facts about myself about my own</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">perspective that i can&#39;t get into view</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like trying to look at my own eyes</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">well i could do it if i had a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">right and you could be the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">but you might be like a super cloudy</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:11.839" style="s2">mirror or like a really crummy mirror</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">because you&#39;re so like obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.839" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">whatever points you had coming into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">conversation and with</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">saying them that you don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">allow me to see myself</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">and i think socrates prided himself on</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:25.599" style="s2">being an awesome mirror right he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the one thing i can do</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.599" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">is be the mirror and i think that he</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">thought of philosophical conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">really as people being able to serve as</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:36.960" style="s2">mirrors for one another and philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">are super good at this like if you give</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.960" end="00:42:40.319" style="s2">a talk in a philosophy department</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">all of the questions are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.319" end="00:42:43.520" style="s2">like here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.920" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">that one thing you said is inconsistent</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.520" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2">with that other thing you said i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">keep myself out of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:49.680" style="s2">right that&#39;s being a mirror so i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">that um whether or not i can have this</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:57.599" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">with someone else is a function</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.599" end="00:43:04.000" style="s2">of how good a mirror they can be and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:05.520" style="s2">you know part of the story here is we</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.000" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">want to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.520" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">really good mirrors to other people um</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">and this is why i think for instance</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">like just in thinking in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">contemporary culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">debate is very unsocratic so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">you have two people and each of them has</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">opinions</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">that&#39;s one too many sets of opinions</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:26.560" style="s2">nobody&#39;s going to be anybody&#39;s mirror in</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">that situation right</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.560" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">what you need is like a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">there&#39;s only one set of opinions</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s um that&#39;s sort of what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">by like there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">one bit of thinking that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">put in two bodies but there&#39;s one bit of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">thinking um</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s never going to take the form</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">of a debate so debate in some way is</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">un-philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">by this way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">all right um john you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna meet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">john bae</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">okay i will read it on his behalf</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">um in a context of a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">constantly changing</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">uh in all levels of micro environments</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">to macro environments</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">planets etc right or wrong is fluid</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">that has been said even if we are right</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">in the next second we might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">next in the next</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">i think there are things that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.319" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">change uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">slavery is wrong it was always wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not fluid</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">um uh mathematical facts have always</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">been true</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:55.839" style="s2">so there&#39;s like a set of facts that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">fluid that change</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.839" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">um empirical facts right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">i think that um with respect to those</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">facts</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">um if we want to know how things stand</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:12.079" style="s2">we have to um go check so if i do</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">like is it cold or where i&#39;m at well i</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">have to go check something</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">interesting about that go check is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">i can suspend judgment there right</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">so i can be like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">let me check and then i&#39;ll get back to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">you right and i can spend this time</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">not knowing um</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">and so i think the world of like flux</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">and change</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">is also the world that we are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">suspending judgment about but then there</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.800" end="00:45:45.440" style="s2">are things like moral judgments</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">right like um is something just or</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.440" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">unjust</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">um where we are very quick in jumping to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s not because we&#39;re somehow</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">arrogant or overconfident in those</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s because those questions are urgent</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">to us in a way where we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">live even a minute without the answer</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">we&#39;re i think kind of literally living</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">on the answer the answer is part of how</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">we live and so we need the answer to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">there so we can live</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">um and i think moral questions are like</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.800" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t think those things fluctuate but</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">we fluctuate</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">because we cut we give reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">immediate answers</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">but there isn&#39;t a lot of stability in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">how we answer and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:33.280" style="s2">though we&#39;re always giving an answer the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:34.720" style="s2">answer kind of shifts and changes i</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.280" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">noticed this you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.720" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">the first time i really noticed this</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">actually was when my oldest son</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">was like little and i would read him</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">children&#39;s books and like the moral</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">of the one book would be like</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">um be who you are and it&#39;s fine if</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">you&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:52.800" style="s2">um and don&#39;t conform to what other</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">people expect of you and like the moral</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.800" end="00:46:55.680" style="s2">of the next book is like sharing is</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">caring and like</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.680" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">rainbow fish gives a little one of his</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">colors to all the other fish so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">everybody can have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">little rainbow color on their thing like</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">versus elmer the elephant who keeps all</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">the rainbow to himself and he&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">to be just</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.319" end="00:47:09.839" style="s2">like loved for being different right</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like these two books are telling my</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.839" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">child contradictory things</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">so some of that fluctuation that we see</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">in how we respond to the world some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:19.520" style="s2">it is that the world is fluctuating and</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the empirical stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">other fluctuation is like we&#39;re screwed</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">up we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">stable moral compass to guide us</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">uh and those sorts of mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">i think are ones that we should try to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">stop making um</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">um because it&#39;s not true that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">contradictory moral claims</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">are both correct it&#39;s just that like we</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">have a hard time getting our bearing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:44.559" style="s2">so we&#39;re not giving consistent responses</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.559" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">what i want to say is that i think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">you know there are very different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">of fluctuations</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">and some of them reflect defects in us</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:47:58.720" style="s2">and some of them don&#39;t and the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">reflect defects in us</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.720" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">are precisely going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:07.440" style="s2">you know defects where we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.319" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">taking ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.440" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">to know something to be able to give to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">really have a thought through answer to</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:13.599" style="s2">something where we don&#39;t have a thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">through answer we just have like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.599" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">reflexive quick response</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">cool uh stefan uh do you want to read</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">uh sure all right so</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">basically i&#39;m wondering you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.319" style="s2">these different versions of us the today</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">me the right now me</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.319" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">and then there&#39;s that person yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">or yesteryear</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">and often that person before</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">makes a commitment for me to execute</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">if i don&#39;t execute who&#39;s the wrong one</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">the one who fails to execute or the one</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">who fails to anticipate that</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">you know i might not be in the mood or i</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">might not have tools or i</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">have this</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.480" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">good um i i</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.000" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">guess i think it could be either one um</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.880" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">it it might depend on whether we</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:27.119" style="s2">take that little sort of that episode</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">and what is the larger story that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.119" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">part of right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">um you know um</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">one kind of case is a case where</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">um let&#39;s say i&#39;m weak willed right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">so i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">um oh i should you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:49.920" style="s2">go to bed early because in the morning i</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">have this thing i have to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.920" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">and i know that i should do that but</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">then when the time comes right</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">i flip right and i&#39;m like oh i just feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">like staying up a little more</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2">um and then you want to say okay what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">the bigger picture the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">is um you know my real commitments or</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.920" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">are it could go either way actually but</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">let&#39;s just tell the story where the real</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">commitment is</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">that i am um</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">you know this thing was really important</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">to me and i really should have gone to</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:21.359" style="s2">bed and then it&#39;s like i failed in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.359" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">right and we do fail the moment so like</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">um but we would need that bigger</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">diachronic story because</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:29.920" style="s2">it could go otherwise too you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:30.480" style="s2">there&#39;s you could tell a story where</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.920" end="00:50:33.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.480" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">somebody is like in grad school and like</p>

<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">analysis and i&#39;m like this is crazy i</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">should i&#39;m a classicist i&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">reading greek there&#39;s not supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:06.559" style="s2">um but um you know i&#39;m like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">so akratic of me right</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.559" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">but in fact it was like well that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">like kind of a bad theory of myself</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">end up as a classicist i ended up as</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">somebody where these questions about</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">the division of the self and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">unconscious were really deeply gripping</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">and my weakness of will was in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">beginning of my inquiry into a certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">thing that i couldn&#39;t quite see that</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.839" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">that&#39;s what it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">a lot of times when we&#39;re weak willed</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">we have a bad theory about what like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">main background state of ourselves is</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:35.920" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">we&#39;re actually sort of aspiring to be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.920" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">slightly different person and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">if you want to know like who&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:44.240" style="s2">who&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">and you kind of need that longer story</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.240" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">and what that us</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">what also you know follows from that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">like if you only have the shorter bit of</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">the story you just might not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">and could be a little bit of both</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:51:57.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">this communicate obviously in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.760" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">communication so they&#39;re both both wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">to a certain degree</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">yes i think that yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">in fact i think that in all of the cases</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">they&#39;re both going to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:11.119" style="s2">there&#39;s just a question of who&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">because like you know that background</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">perspective of prudence or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:21.839" style="s2">tells me i should go to bed early</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like if i really knew that i agree</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:24.800" style="s2">with socrates on this that if i really</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.280" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">knew that and i had really reasoned that</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.800" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">out firmly and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">really had taken a hold of my soul then</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t be tempted</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">so obviously there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">with how i&#39;m gripping that and so even</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">that is like wrong um</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">um in the sense that i don&#39;t fully grasp</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">it in the way that i take myself to</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">so yeah i think that they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">somewhat wrong yeah go ahead and just</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">last follow-up and then when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">nuts like that but let&#39;s say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">just two</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">two goods that are in conflict and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">just can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">do both or they&#39;re just you know so</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">is that the same situation or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">conflicting goods and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">one as opposed to sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">crazier grazia</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.559" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s really different um</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:15.680" style="s2">so i think that the difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">in um in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.680" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">akrazia weakness of will we um</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">take ourselves to know quite firmly</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">which of the two things we ought to</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:27.680" style="s2">pursue we might be wrong about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">but we take ourselves to know it um</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">whereas if i&#39;m torn between two options</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.559" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">um both of which look good to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">right um i have not yet completed</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:43.200" style="s2">the deliberative process that theocratic</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">takes herself to be at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.200" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">or maybe i never will right maybe i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">just have to pick or something but still</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">accuracy is not possible until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">completed that process cool</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">um so we have about four minutes do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">want to close it here do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">sneak in another</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">question let&#39;s get another question okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">kevin deland you had a question if</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">you&#39;re to mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">kevin</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:21.359" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.559" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">there&#39;s uh okay so that&#39;s just a joke</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:28.400" style="s2">okay um i thought you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:29.119" style="s2">about kevin but i&#39;ll read someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.400" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.119" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">does the fact that experts in science</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">philosophy et cetera disagree mean that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">they cannot teach</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">convince each other that therefore they</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">have no knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:45.599" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">with respect to science yes that would</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.599" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">be true i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">um but it&#39;s not true about science um</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">the experts don&#39;t disagree</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">uh they might disagree on like points of</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:55.839" style="s2">detail right where which is lies at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">margin of the field</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">right um and that&#39;s exactly the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">that they don&#39;t know yet</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:02.960" style="s2">right the stuff that they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">disagreeing about philosophy is really</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.960" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">so um uh in the case of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">there is um</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:27.119" style="s2">no possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:28.880" style="s2">um someone can like do it for you</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.119" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">in the sense that people can kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.880" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">your scientific thinking for you like</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:35.280" style="s2">people do most of our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">thinking for us right so they like</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.280" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">you know everything i think about like</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:41.839" style="s2">matter is is stuff i don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:44.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like i trust you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:46.079" style="s2">scientists tell me this is how it goes</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">and i trust them and there&#39;s some fancy</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.079" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">math and some experiments that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">know about</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:51.119" style="s2">um but like i&#39;ve sort of like farmed it</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">out right</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.119" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s the nature of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">thinking is that it can be farmed out to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">experts</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">and the experts had better agree because</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">that&#39;s part of how we know who to farm</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">it out to</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">um but in philosophy the experts don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.240" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">agree but also we can&#39;t farm it out</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">so um uh it&#39;s like suppose</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">like i&#39;m like you know like i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">to you about knowing that you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">and i have this view but like you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">to come to see it for yourself you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.319" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:25.119" style="s2">you you can&#39;t just you can&#39;t defer to me</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">right you can&#39;t be like well i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.119" end="00:56:30.319" style="s2">adopt her views</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">um and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.319" end="00:56:38.480" style="s2">in effect um you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:41.200" style="s2">if i um</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.480" end="00:56:41.599" style="s2">me kind of like counting as knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.200" end="00:56:43.359" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.599" end="00:56:44.880" style="s2">being able to persuade you and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.359" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">seeing it for yourself like those were</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no thing where like i just kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.240" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">of say it and you take it up without</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:55.760" style="s2">fully grasping it for yourself and so in</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">effect</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:56:59.119" style="s2">because anyway there&#39;s no shortcut</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">around you knowing it for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.119" end="00:57:02.480" style="s2">from your point of view like whether i</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:04.079" style="s2">know it or not shouldn&#39;t be that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.480" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">interesting or important to you right</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.559" end="00:57:18.319" style="s2">uh but we can still serve as mirrors for</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">one another right and we do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.319" end="00:57:21.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s still just true that if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">want to know something</p>
