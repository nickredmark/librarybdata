<p begin="00:00:00.160" end="00:00:03.679" style="s2">good let me try summing up what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.680" end="00:00:05.040" style="s2">said so far and you can tell me if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.679" end="00:00:08.320" style="s2">full of shit or not or</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.040" end="00:00:10.960" style="s2">uh or close or off which is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.320" end="00:00:11.679" style="s2">the answer to the question of at least</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.960" end="00:00:14.080" style="s2">an answer</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.679" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">a beginning answer to how game b could</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.080" end="00:00:17.039" style="s2">beat game a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:19.359" style="s2">despite the fact that it&#39;s tiny today</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.039" end="00:00:22.720" style="s2">and game a is huge and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.359" end="00:00:25.760" style="s2">is that game a if it&#39;s crafted correctly</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.720" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">will do a better job of processing the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.760" end="00:00:29.599" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:31.519" style="s2">in a non-linear high complexity fashion</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">and even though it starts small</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.519" end="00:00:35.920" style="s2">it will have a higher exponent and those</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:37.120" style="s2">of us with a little bit of quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.920" end="00:00:38.960" style="s2">background know</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.120" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">that over a long enough period of time</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.960" end="00:00:42.239" style="s2">you can start mighty small and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">growing at a higher exponent you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:44.800" style="s2">eventually beat the big guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:46.960" style="s2">growing at a lower</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.800" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">growing in a broader sense of solving</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.960" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">the world&#39;s problems</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">than than the bigger guy is that getting</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:52.719" style="s2">something near the sense of what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:54.879" style="s2">were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">uh communicate yep yeah that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.879" end="00:00:57.039" style="s2">much i think you may have started with</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">game a but</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.039" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">it became evident that you definitely</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:01.280" style="s2">meant game b there and yes so that would</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">be that okay and this is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.280" end="00:01:05.439" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:07.119" style="s2">when this rate versus state trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.439" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">is so important you know so if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.119" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">got a starting</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">gate where the the ability to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:16.400" style="s2">do this innovation thing the raw</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.400" end="00:01:19.119" style="s2">for doing the innovation the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:20.080" style="s2">apotheosis the phase space of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.119" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">possibility is now</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:24.880" style="s2">very very large and so the leverage of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">increasing your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.880" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">to do innovation to to to move the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">the adjacent possible is is very high</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">you know so</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">if we had tried to do this game b thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:37.040" style="s2">in 1750</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t have gotten there because</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.040" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t enough stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">in the space of possibility even if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">try to do in 1950 we couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">gotten there</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">but but now we can&#39;t or at least at</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">least in principle it&#39;s possible that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of this weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.840" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">where almost exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">that causes gaming to be so challenging</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.840" end="00:01:59.920" style="s2">accelerating change happens to be the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:02.320" style="s2">same exact characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">that drives the possibility of game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.320" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">and we can exactly say that the game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">designed from the from the get go to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">substantially better at innovation</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">than game a and okay that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">actually kind of simple it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">as we&#39;re trying to do we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">how do we take a look at this thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">called creative collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">and how do we do that thing how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">design something which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">just a whole lot better at creative</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">collaboration recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">we&#39;re now in a place where escape</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">velocity</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">through the innovation vector is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">available we might actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">do something with just</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">so much better that it just lifts off</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">you know let&#39;s say that game a right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">has a million</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">power um and this is i&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">read in numbers just re-articulate what</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">you just said</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">the game gaming has a million power and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">its rate</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:51.599" style="s2">of change is a hundred thousand per unit</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.599" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">and so next unit you know t plus one</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">it&#39;s 100 a million one</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">let&#39;s say game b right now is starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">out at 10 000 power</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">uh but its rate of change is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:06.640" style="s2">compounding curve so it&#39;s not a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">thousand per unit time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.640" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">1.1 times its current number</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">and so it&#39;s going to take a while for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">while 10 000 times</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">1.1 is not getting a lot bigger but</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">obviously if you just draw the curves</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">there is a crossover point and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">crossover point by the way is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">crossover point with wings</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">because you know you&#39;ve crossed over and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">a not very long time after you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">crossed over you&#39;ve blown right past</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">and not very long time after that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">actually gone so far past that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">even clear what the hell just happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">and we can actually be in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">even very concrete about this i think it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">an sfi book but maybe it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">i think it may have been the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">well and there was a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">you know what it meant actually maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">was matt ridley&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">where they were talking about like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">have been louis xiv</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">and you know on the one hand to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">been louis the 14th</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">at his time frame had a was massively</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">massively better than just being an</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">average person</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">and on the other hand almost everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">alive right now is better off than louis</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">xiv</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">the simple fact of say for example we</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">have toothbrushes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">obviously telecommunications</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">transportation air conditioning indoor</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">plumbing</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">antibiotics like fill in the blank and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">you know the the rate of of innovation</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">compared to the state is one where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">have all</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">blown right by so if you imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">you had a choice the the louis louis xiv</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">was sitting there and he had a choice he</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">could either ride</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">train a where he gets to be louis the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">14th and gets to be the top dog</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">but train a has a particular rate of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:43.199" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:44.639" style="s2">or he gets on train b and train b has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.199" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">characteristic where he no longer gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.639" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">to be louis the 14th he just has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">peer along with everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">but it has a different a faster rate of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">he may be hard pressed to make that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">choice he may be like man i really</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">prefer to be lou the 14th</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually a better choice if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">like things like toothbrushes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">indoor plumbing and modern dentistry in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">general whenever people talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">good old days i just say</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">modern dentistry right and of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">when i&#39;m when i&#39;m right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">a lot of the languaging is focused on</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">stuff like technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">like physical technology like modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">dentistry or toothbrushes</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">but in the context of game b what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">notice is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">a large amount of the innovation field</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">actually has to happen at the level</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:32.479" style="s2">of people relationships</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">human beings innovation happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.479" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">of how human beings are able to show up</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">in relationship with themselves with</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">each other and with nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">for the obvious reason that if you all</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">you do is run forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">at a faster pace along the technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.960" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">vector</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">you&#39;re just going to blow us up faster</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">so we have to actually do something and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">this is okay this is one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">i at least spend a lot of time thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:58.880" style="s2">about it in terms of meta design and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.479" style="s2">in terms of just engineering</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to develop something</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">which is just a whole lot better at</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:05.919" style="s2">creative collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">we actually notice from the very get-go</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.919" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">that we also have to design something</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">that is a whole lot better</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">at cultivating collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">that is at least symmetric with and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:19.919" style="s2">probably more superior to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">the power that we&#39;re generating through</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.919" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">this creative collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">so like this is a meta design constraint</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">game b must must must orient its primary</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">innovation capacity</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">first and foremost towards cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">individual and collective sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.560" style="s2">which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">wisdom and maturity and a an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">of how choices actually show up in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">more than the rate at which it increases</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">individual collective power</p>
