<p begin="00:02:55.860" end="00:03:16.380" style="s2">story it&#39;s it I have a mic on here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:21.299" style="s2">so okay so I started studying the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.380" end="00:03:24.450" style="s2">that I have been talking about in well</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.299" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">really as long back as I can remember I</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.450" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">think that&#39;s true I wrote an essay when</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">I was about 13 on the on ash with it</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">wasn&#39;t very good essay but I was only 13</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that surprising but and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly why it was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">particular concern to me except that of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:51.299" style="s2">course it&#39;s the sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:53.880" style="s2">should be of concern to everyone how</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.299" end="00:03:59.250" style="s2">about if I speak a little louder all</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.880" end="00:04:01.799" style="s2">right all right no I&#39;ll do it I&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.250" end="00:04:03.420" style="s2">this way I think if you have any trouble</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.799" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">at the back let me know what I&#39;ll all</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.420" end="00:04:09.620" style="s2">make sure that I&#39;m projecting so I said</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">when I was about 13 I wrote an essay on</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.620" end="00:04:16.590" style="s2">on our Swift and I I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:18.539" style="s2">understand it I think maybe I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:22.320" style="s2">understand it in a way that was somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.539" end="00:04:24.870" style="s2">different than most people who examine</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">historical events because I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.870" end="00:04:32.340" style="s2">to understand how human beings could do</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:34.289" style="s2">that knowing full well that I was one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.340" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">them and that&#39;s the critical thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.289" end="00:04:41.400" style="s2">because generally when people examine</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:44.639" style="s2">especially something horrifying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:46.890" style="s2">done by humanity they make the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.639" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">assumption that it&#39;s other people doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.890" end="00:04:54.990" style="s2">it and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a big mistake</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:56.659" style="s2">in my estimation because if a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.990" end="00:04:57.900" style="s2">human beings have done something</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.659" end="00:05:02.909" style="s2">terrible</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.900" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">you can be sure that being a human being</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.909" end="00:05:09.090" style="s2">that you&#39;re capable of it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:12.210" style="s2">one of the things that we&#39;ve been asked</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.090" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">repeatedly to do as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.210" end="00:05:19.129" style="s2">what happened in world war 2 is to not</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:23.580" style="s2">forget it but it&#39;s always been my</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.129" end="00:05:25.139" style="s2">contention that you can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.580" end="00:05:29.069" style="s2">something you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.139" end="00:05:31.949" style="s2">and you don&#39;t understand what happened</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.069" end="00:05:34.530" style="s2">in Nazi Germany or in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.949" end="00:05:37.469" style="s2">for that matter until you understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.530" end="00:05:38.909" style="s2">that had you been there the probability</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.469" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2">that you would have played a role and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.909" end="00:05:43.259" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t have been a positive one</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:46.620" style="s2">is extraordinarily high when people do</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.259" end="00:05:48.509" style="s2">think about themselves as actors in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.620" end="00:05:50.310" style="s2">situations like that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.509" end="00:05:53.629" style="s2">proclivity to cast themselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.310" end="00:05:56.610" style="s2">heroic role assuming that had they been</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.629" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">say in Nazi Germany in the 1930s that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.610" end="00:06:03.719" style="s2">they would have taken on the burden of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">fighting against the Nazis and defending</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.719" end="00:06:07.099" style="s2">the things that should have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:10.169" style="s2">defended but that&#39;s a very foolish</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.099" end="00:06:12.180" style="s2">presupposition especially because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.169" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">more or less self-evident from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.180" end="00:06:16.379" style="s2">historical perspective that that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:20.279" style="s2">what people did and in order for us to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.379" end="00:06:22.979" style="s2">come to terms with that it means that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.279" end="00:06:26.460" style="s2">have to understand how it happened but</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.979" end="00:06:31.259" style="s2">more importantly what role we still play</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.460" end="00:06:35.339" style="s2">as individuals in acting in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.259" end="00:06:37.940" style="s2">that such things are not only likely but</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.339" end="00:06:37.940" style="s2">desired</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.530" end="00:06:51.890" style="s2">when I was older and in university I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.510" end="00:06:53.930" style="s2">plagued by nightmares mostly about they</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.890" end="00:06:56.840" style="s2">were apocalyptic nightmares mostly about</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.930" end="00:07:03.290" style="s2">the third world war and I had very large</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.840" end="00:07:07.550" style="s2">long series of dreams about about</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.290" end="00:07:10.040" style="s2">nuclear bombs I remember one of them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.550" end="00:07:15.740" style="s2">I was living in Edmonton at the time and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.040" end="00:07:17.870" style="s2">on the on the south side and I could</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.740" end="00:07:20.750" style="s2">remember watching out through my window</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.870" end="00:07:23.240" style="s2">in the dream I&#39;m seeing mushroom cloud</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.750" end="00:07:26.990" style="s2">form over the main core of the city and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.240" end="00:07:28.310" style="s2">then the dream shifted locales and there</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.990" end="00:07:31.880" style="s2">were a bunch of people in the wreckage</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.310" end="00:07:34.580" style="s2">and they started to fight and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.880" end="00:07:37.160" style="s2">that&#39;s just exactly right and that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.580" end="00:07:39.830" style="s2">exactly what my nightmares were like</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.160" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">that no matter how tremendous the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.830" end="00:07:46.820" style="s2">catastrophe we don&#39;t seem able to derive</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:49.340" style="s2">the proper conclusions from us and start</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.820" end="00:07:54.050" style="s2">to act in a way that makes us things</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.340" end="00:07:55.880" style="s2">less rather than more likely when I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.050" end="00:07:59.030" style="s2">in graduate school at McGill which would</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.880" end="00:08:01.550" style="s2">have been after that I was studying</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.030" end="00:08:03.770" style="s2">political science decor that sorry back</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.550" end="00:08:05.630" style="s2">when I was in Edmonton and before that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.770" end="00:08:09.380" style="s2">had even thought about going into into</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.630" end="00:08:11.660" style="s2">law but as I studied political science I</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.380" end="00:08:13.340" style="s2">got increasingly disenchanted with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.660" end="00:08:16.820" style="s2">explanations that were being offered to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.340" end="00:08:21.050" style="s2">me about motivations for for human</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.820" end="00:08:24.350" style="s2">conflict that especially in the upper</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.050" end="00:08:25.820" style="s2">years of my undergraduate education that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.350" end="00:08:27.590" style="s2">the lower years were pretty good because</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.820" end="00:08:28.880" style="s2">mostly what I studied was political</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.590" end="00:08:31.450" style="s2">philosophy and literature and I found</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.880" end="00:08:34.310" style="s2">that very helpful but in the upper years</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.450" end="00:08:38.390" style="s2">the the contention of the professor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.310" end="00:08:40.130" style="s2">was that people primarily engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.390" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">conflict for economic reasons that never</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.130" end="00:08:44.930" style="s2">struck me as very deep deep explanation</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:47.540" style="s2">because it didn&#39;t get at the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.930" end="00:08:50.839" style="s2">issue which was well okay people fight</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.540" end="00:08:52.730" style="s2">about things of material value but why</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.839" end="00:08:54.440" style="s2">do they value those things I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.730" end="00:08:56.449" style="s2">self-evidence if you think about food</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.440" end="00:08:58.010" style="s2">and shelter and so forth but you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.449" end="00:09:00.019" style="s2">generally speaking especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.010" end="00:09:01.399" style="s2">20th century it wasn&#39;t necessarily about</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.019" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">the basics of food and shelter that</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.399" end="00:09:05.779" style="s2">people were engaging in conflict about</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">it was it was something much more subtle</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.779" end="00:09:09.829" style="s2">than that maybe it had more to do with</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:11.959" style="s2">national identity with identity that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.829" end="00:09:14.149" style="s2">kind of thing and so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.959" end="00:09:16.010" style="s2">psychological element missing in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.149" end="00:09:19.730" style="s2">analysis of the human propensity for</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.010" end="00:09:22.610" style="s2">conflict that to me loomed larger and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.730" end="00:09:24.589" style="s2">larger and so I decided at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.610" end="00:09:26.540" style="s2">for that reason to pursue a graduate</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.589" end="00:09:28.490" style="s2">degree in psychology and in clinical</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.540" end="00:09:31.610" style="s2">psychology and I went to McGill and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.490" end="00:09:34.699" style="s2">that&#39;s when I started to read very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.610" end="00:09:37.639" style="s2">more broadly I suppose and I spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.699" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">of time reading I read a lot of Freud</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.639" end="00:09:41.720" style="s2">and a lot of all the classic clinical</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:45.740" style="s2">psychologists who extraordinarily useful</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.720" end="00:09:49.730" style="s2">Carl Rogers and Sigmund Freud and Alfred</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.740" end="00:09:51.290" style="s2">Adler and a whole host of them all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.730" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">classic thinkers I could get my hands on</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.290" end="00:09:57.500" style="s2">and also most particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:09:59.959" style="s2">philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche most of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.500" end="00:10:02.750" style="s2">whose major work works I read at that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.959" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">point in Fyodor Dostoyevsky who was</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.750" end="00:10:05.990" style="s2">writing very similar things to Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:07.550" style="s2">there in fact Nietzsche was quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.990" end="00:10:10.970" style="s2">influenced by Dostoyevsky and Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.550" end="00:10:15.920" style="s2">was a like a master in the literary</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.970" end="00:10:18.459" style="s2">genre his five great books focused on</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.920" end="00:10:20.779" style="s2">the most difficult questions that face</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.459" end="00:10:22.180" style="s2">humanity both socially and individually</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.779" end="00:10:25.010" style="s2">I found those books overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.180" end="00:10:28.250" style="s2">powerful and also extraordinarily useful</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.010" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">good the only good or Crime and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.250" end="00:10:34.250" style="s2">Punishment for example if a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:35.870" style="s2">brilliant piece of work outlining the</p>

<p begin="00:10:35.870" end="00:10:42.949" style="s2">himself as above all law and who decides</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.829" end="00:10:47.209" style="s2">that to not kill when necessary is an</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.949" end="00:10:49.430" style="s2">act of cowardice and so doth dfd walks</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.209" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">through his rationalization sense and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.430" end="00:10:56.449" style="s2">the murder and the aftermath of it in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">way that&#39;s extraordinarily enlightening</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.449" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">and painful simultaneously and at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:04.939" style="s2">same time Nietzsche in Germany was</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:06.540" style="s2">writing philosophical tract on exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.939" end="00:11:11.010" style="s2">the same themes their lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.540" end="00:11:13.770" style="s2">an unbelievably close parallel in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.010" end="00:11:15.390" style="s2">when Nietzsche finally went insane he</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.770" end="00:11:18.060" style="s2">had some illness that has been very</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.390" end="00:11:20.730" style="s2">difficult to diagnose he had he&#39;d seen</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.060" end="00:11:23.190" style="s2">someone beating a horse in the street</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.730" end="00:11:25.320" style="s2">and embraced it out of compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.190" end="00:11:27.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a scene exactly like that in one</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.320" end="00:11:31.800" style="s2">of Dostoyevsky stories so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.870" end="00:11:34.200" style="s2">parallels are really uncanny and I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.800" end="00:11:36.380" style="s2">read a lot of neuroscience because I did</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.200" end="00:11:38.760" style="s2">my thesis on the biological</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.380" end="00:11:40.470" style="s2">predisposition to alcoholism and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.760" end="00:11:43.260" style="s2">required a lot of investigation into</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.470" end="00:11:44.520" style="s2">more hardcore science investigation into</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.260" end="00:11:45.900" style="s2">the structure and function of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.520" end="00:11:48.510" style="s2">and I tried to weave all of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.900" end="00:11:50.820" style="s2">together in a book that I published in</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.510" end="00:11:53.520" style="s2">1999 it took me about 15 years to write</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.820" end="00:11:56.850" style="s2">I was writing three hours a day for</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.520" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">every day and thinking about it all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.850" end="00:12:04.440" style="s2">time like I was absolutely 100% obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:05.670" style="s2">by by the sorts of issues that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.440" end="00:12:08.580" style="s2">discussing with you today</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.670" end="00:12:10.170" style="s2">it took me deep I read Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.580" end="00:12:13.220" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn much of what he wrote at</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.170" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">the same time and then of course I</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.220" end="00:12:17.820" style="s2">studied Carl Jung in great depth when I</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">finally started to crack what he was up</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.820" end="00:12:22.770" style="s2">talking about was extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:24.150" style="s2">difficult material I read volume 9 of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.770" end="00:12:25.910" style="s2">his collected works which is called</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.150" end="00:12:27.930" style="s2">archetypes of the collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.910" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">and first time I read it I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.930" end="00:12:32.490" style="s2">understand a word he was saying and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:34.020" style="s2">think that&#39;s very common experience for</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.490" end="00:12:38.070" style="s2">people reading Jung has certainly</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.020" end="00:12:42.050" style="s2">persona non grata in the modern academy</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.070" end="00:12:42.050" style="s2">and I think the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.670" end="00:12:49.230" style="s2">well I think when you first encounter</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.720" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">you you tend to bounce off them and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.230" end="00:12:52.530" style="s2">the next thing that happens is you get</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:54.690" style="s2">very frightened and then you just leave</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.530" end="00:12:56.670" style="s2">it the hell alone and and it&#39;s no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.690" end="00:12:58.350" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.670" end="00:13:01.970" style="s2">think I&#39;ve ever read anyone including me</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.350" end="00:13:04.950" style="s2">chip that was more terrifying than young</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.970" end="00:13:06.810" style="s2">Nick Young was a student of Nietzsche I</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.950" end="00:13:08.760" style="s2">don&#39;t mean technically speaking although</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.810" end="00:13:10.170" style="s2">Nietzsche was everywhere Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.760" end="00:13:13.080" style="s2">thinking was everywhere when you lose</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.170" end="00:13:16.860" style="s2">maturing people no Carl Jung primarily</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.080" end="00:13:18.900" style="s2">as a disciple let&#39;s say a Freud which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.860" end="00:13:20.040" style="s2">true in part because Freud of course did</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.900" end="00:13:23.579" style="s2">the initial you my</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.040" end="00:13:25.800" style="s2">might describe it as initial excavating</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.579" end="00:13:27.690" style="s2">work outlining the fact that there was</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.800" end="00:13:30.750" style="s2">more going on in the human psyche than</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.690" end="00:13:32.070" style="s2">the met the conscious eye and his</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.750" end="00:13:34.529" style="s2">greatest work likely was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.070" end="00:13:38.339" style="s2">interpretation of dreams where he</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.529" end="00:13:43.889" style="s2">started to perform an archaeology of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.339" end="00:13:48.329" style="s2">of the symbolic unconscious showing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.889" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">much of our mental life went on in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.329" end="00:13:51.690" style="s2">sense underneath our conscious awareness</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:53.940" style="s2">which is of course regarded as a truism</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.690" end="00:13:55.800" style="s2">now by psychologists but was quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.940" end="00:13:59.310" style="s2">revolutionary at the time it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.800" end="00:14:01.880" style="s2">Freud wasn&#39;t entirely an original idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.310" end="00:14:05.430" style="s2">with Freud few things are entirely</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.880" end="00:14:07.290" style="s2">regional ideas but he went farther than</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.430" end="00:14:09.509" style="s2">anyone else synthesizing it and also</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.290" end="00:14:11.490" style="s2">publicizing and promoting it and also</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.509" end="00:14:13.170" style="s2">basing a psychotherapeutic theory on it</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.490" end="00:14:15.660" style="s2">pretty remarkable set of accomplishments</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.170" end="00:14:18.600" style="s2">and Jung was very much influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.660" end="00:14:19.920" style="s2">Freud but also by Nietzsche and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.600" end="00:14:23.300" style="s2">reason he was influenced by Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.920" end="00:14:25.589" style="s2">most particularly was that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.300" end="00:14:27.899" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s announcement of the death of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.589" end="00:14:31.860" style="s2">God in the late 1900s was a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.899" end="00:14:33.240" style="s2">striking philosophical event and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.860" end="00:14:37.260" style="s2">I&#39;ll return to this but Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.240" end="00:14:40.699" style="s2">believed that because God was dead so to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.260" end="00:14:43.800" style="s2">speak and the value structure upon which</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.699" end="00:14:47.100" style="s2">Western civilization was constructed had</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.800" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">God at its foundation that that would</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.100" end="00:14:51.899" style="s2">all crumble and that people would have</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:53.639" style="s2">to become their own deities in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.899" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">they would have to discover or create</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.639" end="00:14:59.430" style="s2">for Nietzsche to create their own values</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:15:03.060" style="s2">and before nature could outline how that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.430" end="00:15:05.459" style="s2">might happen he suffered the unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.060" end="00:15:08.130" style="s2">descent into madness and then died and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.459" end="00:15:13.790" style="s2">so he left this major problem behind</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.130" end="00:15:13.790" style="s2">which is if it&#39;s the case that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:22.589" style="s2">radiation of Western civilization was</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.620" end="00:15:25.529" style="s2">predicated on illusion on an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.589" end="00:15:29.399" style="s2">what what what what would we do next</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.529" end="00:15:33.190" style="s2">and Nietzsche said well that what we</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.150" end="00:15:41.740" style="s2">totalitarianism because those will be</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:44.290" style="s2">the things that will beckon most clearly</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.740" end="00:15:46.660" style="s2">in the chaotic aftermath of the</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.230" end="00:16:28.900" style="s2">like 1880 it&#39;s absolutely remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.520" end="00:16:30.850" style="s2">Young was very interested in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.850" end="00:16:35.590" style="s2">it than anything else because he knew</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:37.660" style="s2">that the question of where we would</p>

<p begin="00:16:50.200" end="00:16:54.760" style="s2">address that Young&#39;s idea was that we</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.760" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">own values because human beings cannot</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.380" end="00:17:03.490" style="s2">create their own values and you know</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.430" end="00:17:13.750" style="s2">regard it better but you&#39;ll find out</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.230" end="00:17:15.970" style="s2">very rapidly that you can&#39;t enslave</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.750" end="00:17:17.709" style="s2">yourself and tell yourself what to do so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.970" end="00:17:19.750" style="s2">easily even when you&#39;re motivated to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.709" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">good things you know when you make your</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.750" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">new year&#39;s resolutions and say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">you&#39;re going to eat properly and go to</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:27.310" style="s2">the gym that generally lasts about a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:29.110" style="s2">week and so you can&#39;t boss yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.310" end="00:17:30.670" style="s2">around as it turns out no more than you</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.110" end="00:17:32.830" style="s2">can really boss other people around and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.670" end="00:17:35.020" style="s2">it&#39;s because you do have a nature you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.830" end="00:17:39.010" style="s2">have a nature and you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.020" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">arbitrarily mold and shape that nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.010" end="00:17:43.570" style="s2">because if you like other people will</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:45.950" style="s2">rebel against your own will and so and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.570" end="00:17:47.510" style="s2">so young content</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.950" end="00:17:49.670" style="s2">was that we would have to go inside</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.510" end="00:17:52.670" style="s2">ourselves but that&#39;s how he looked at it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.670" end="00:17:55.670" style="s2">into the symbolic background of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.670" end="00:18:01.610" style="s2">psychological structure and rediscover</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.670" end="00:18:04.490" style="s2">what we had lost and so I found that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.610" end="00:18:07.490" style="s2">the ancient mythological motif of voyage</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.490" end="00:18:09.770" style="s2">into the depths and rescuing your father</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.490" end="00:18:14.900" style="s2">from the belly of the beast and you see</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.770" end="00:18:21.620" style="s2">that idea reflected often in popular</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.900" end="00:18:23.450" style="s2">culture on a very well developed example</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.620" end="00:18:25.370" style="s2">of that is in the movie Pinocchio which</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.450" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">I&#39;m sure how many of you have seen that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.370" end="00:18:30.890" style="s2">Louie yeah right well that speaks for</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:34.070" style="s2">itself right I mean there&#39;s a why why</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.890" end="00:18:36.290" style="s2">why are you watching a puppet an</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.070" end="00:18:38.270" style="s2">animated puppet rescue is farther from</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.290" end="00:18:39.980" style="s2">the belly of a whale it makes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.270" end="00:18:41.690" style="s2">no sense but you don&#39;t care when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.980" end="00:18:43.190" style="s2">watching it you think this is quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.690" end="00:18:44.630" style="s2">interesting and the reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.190" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">interesting is because it speaks to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.630" end="00:18:49.220" style="s2">at a level that you understand but that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:52.310" style="s2">you do not understand how you understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.220" end="00:18:54.740" style="s2">and of course any good work of art does</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.310" end="00:18:57.560" style="s2">exactly that to you it speaks to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.740" end="00:19:00.350" style="s2">about things that you almost know but</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.560" end="00:19:04.520" style="s2">don&#39;t yet know and that&#39;s what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.350" end="00:19:07.010" style="s2">profound and you knew that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.520" end="00:19:09.500" style="s2">necessary for modern people to journey</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.010" end="00:19:11.240" style="s2">to the chaotic depths and rescue their</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.500" end="00:19:14.150" style="s2">dead farther from the underworld which</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.240" end="00:19:15.920" style="s2">is a very interesting symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.150" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">realization in the aftermath of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.920" end="00:19:19.490" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s statement that God had died</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:21.320" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what you did that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.490" end="00:19:23.510" style="s2">he spent his entire life doing and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.320" end="00:19:25.970" style="s2">detailed that out in a very long series</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.510" end="00:19:29.090" style="s2">of very difficult and and very</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.970" end="00:19:32.630" style="s2">unsettling books which people tend not</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.090" end="00:19:35.030" style="s2">to read and and no wonder and no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.630" end="00:19:36.800" style="s2">and so I read everything I could get my</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.030" end="00:19:39.710" style="s2">hands on that Jung had published at that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.800" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">point and a lot of work by various</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.710" end="00:19:45.080" style="s2">historians of religion and like Maria le</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:49.700" style="s2">ADA who&#39;s who&#39;s out of favor because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.080" end="00:19:51.350" style="s2">post modernists don&#39;t like him and and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.700" end="00:19:53.450" style="s2">put this all together in this book that</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.350" end="00:19:55.220" style="s2">I published in 1999 called maps of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.450" end="00:19:57.560" style="s2">meaning and it&#39;s also a very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.220" end="00:19:58.909" style="s2">book and that was some somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.560" end="00:20:01.940" style="s2">purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.909" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">and somewhat inevitable it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.940" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">purposeful because I knew that if I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">going to discuss such things and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:10.399" style="s2">didn&#39;t make it ridiculously rigorous at</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:13.009" style="s2">least to the degree that I was capable</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.399" end="00:20:16.729" style="s2">of doing that that it would be easily</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.009" end="00:20:19.129" style="s2">dismissed and that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.729" end="00:20:20.659" style="s2">counterproductive but but it was also</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.129" end="00:20:22.789" style="s2">because I was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.659" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">rather than trying to write a book I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.789" end="00:20:26.419" style="s2">trying to figure something out and I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:27.859" style="s2">doing that by writing because writing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.419" end="00:20:29.749" style="s2">a very good way of figuring things out</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.859" end="00:20:32.570" style="s2">and I was trying to make it as clear as</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.749" end="00:20:35.659" style="s2">I could but that that wasn&#39;t all that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.570" end="00:20:38.059" style="s2">clear you know it&#39;s about 500 pages long</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.659" end="00:20:40.249" style="s2">I think this book in it and it and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.059" end="00:20:42.590" style="s2">think I rewrote every sentence in it at</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.249" end="00:20:45.139" style="s2">least 50 times probably too many times</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.590" end="00:20:48.409" style="s2">because by the end it got I think I over</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.139" end="00:20:51.889" style="s2">edited it I think it was it&#39;s in some</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.409" end="00:20:53.450" style="s2">sense too tight it it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.889" end="00:20:55.009" style="s2">overworked piece of art that that might</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.450" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">be one way of thinking about it but and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.009" end="00:21:01.429" style="s2">then it&#39;s taken me decades of speaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:03.619" style="s2">about it to continue to what would you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.429" end="00:21:05.599" style="s2">call it purify and refine it so that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.619" end="00:21:08.869" style="s2">can discuss it without having to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.599" end="00:21:10.999" style="s2">through dozens of hours of explanation</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.869" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">and to condense it down into something</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.999" end="00:21:15.979" style="s2">that&#39;s more easily comprehensible so</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:19.279" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to try to do this</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.979" end="00:21:21.769" style="s2">afternoon I want to tell you why I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.279" end="00:21:24.470" style="s2">we&#39;re in the position that we&#39;re in what</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.769" end="00:21:26.840" style="s2">that position is and also potentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.470" end="00:21:29.029" style="s2">what can be done about it and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.840" end="00:21:30.499" style="s2">things because also I believed and still</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.029" end="00:21:33.109" style="s2">do believe that if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.499" end="00:21:35.299" style="s2">understand the problem you can solve it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.109" end="00:21:37.279" style="s2">but but you have that&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.299" end="00:21:39.799" style="s2">indication of your understanding right</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.279" end="00:21:41.269" style="s2">if you if you if you haven&#39;t sold that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.799" end="00:21:42.470" style="s2">you actually don&#39;t understand it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.269" end="00:21:45.229" style="s2">things about it that you still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.470" end="00:21:47.690" style="s2">grout and so when I was writing maps of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.229" end="00:21:49.399" style="s2">meaning I wasn&#39;t so much trying to only</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.690" end="00:21:51.559" style="s2">figure out why it was that people were</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.399" end="00:21:53.330" style="s2">capable of the terribly barbaric things</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.559" end="00:21:55.820" style="s2">that they so happily did at our switch</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.330" end="00:21:58.970" style="s2">but also to figure out what could be</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.779" end="00:22:15.590" style="s2">shortage of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.860" end="00:22:18.019" style="s2">writers who proposed that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.590" end="00:22:20.990" style="s2">are fundamentally flawed in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.019" end="00:22:22.970" style="s2">cannot be rectified in that you know art</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.990" end="00:22:25.399" style="s2">and we have a catastrophic destiny</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.970" end="00:22:26.809" style="s2">waiting for us as a consequence I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.399" end="00:22:28.460" style="s2">in some sense that&#39;s built right into</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.809" end="00:22:30.260" style="s2">the fabric of Christianity itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.460" end="00:22:31.850" style="s2">because of course have these certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.260" end="00:22:33.649" style="s2">variants of it and I&#39;m speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.850" end="00:22:34.870" style="s2">Christianity because in many ways to set</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.649" end="00:22:38.419" style="s2">the foundation of Western society</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.870" end="00:22:40.789" style="s2">because certain elements of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.419" end="00:22:45.019" style="s2">at least regard people as irretrievably</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.789" end="00:22:47.330" style="s2">or irreparably tainted with original sin</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.019" end="00:22:48.740" style="s2">which emerged right at the birth of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.330" end="00:22:50.419" style="s2">species and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.740" end="00:22:52.309" style="s2">extraordinarily powerful about that idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.419" end="00:22:54.139" style="s2">because of course everybody in this room</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.309" end="00:22:56.779" style="s2">knows that they&#39;re seriously flawed and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.139" end="00:22:59.149" style="s2">also those that they do things that make</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.779" end="00:23:00.950" style="s2">those flaws more rather than less likely</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.149" end="00:23:03.429" style="s2">and everyone has that sense about</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.429" end="00:23:08.510" style="s2">narcissistic beyond belief in which case</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.049" end="00:23:10.700" style="s2">they also suspect it but only at an</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.510" end="00:23:12.769" style="s2">unconscious level so you know we do</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.700" end="00:23:15.769" style="s2">carry this sense of ourselves as deeply</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.769" end="00:23:18.500" style="s2">flawed and imperfect and and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.769" end="00:23:20.570" style="s2">fatally so and that seems to be built</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.500" end="00:23:22.570" style="s2">right into us and so maybe there is no</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.570" end="00:23:24.830" style="s2">solution but that seemed like a dismal</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.570" end="00:23:29.090" style="s2">hypothesis to begin with so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.830" end="00:23:30.830" style="s2">do as in it I wanted to investigate as</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.090" end="00:23:33.110" style="s2">deeply as I possibly could to see if I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.830" end="00:23:39.380" style="s2">could conjure up something that vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.110" end="00:23:41.480" style="s2">Rek represented the solution for a long</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.380" end="00:23:45.769" style="s2">time you know there were months when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.480" end="00:23:50.649" style="s2">was writing where I really felt quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.769" end="00:23:52.700" style="s2">mad and what the one of the most intense</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.649" end="00:23:54.500" style="s2">periods of time where that occurred was</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.700" end="00:23:57.529" style="s2">when I think I was kind of on the cusp</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.500" end="00:24:00.950" style="s2">of figuring out what I needed to figure</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.529" end="00:24:02.840" style="s2">out I figured out two things one was</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.950" end="00:24:04.309" style="s2">that I kind of understood finally why</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.840" end="00:24:08.570" style="s2">people had belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.309" end="00:24:11.000" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t the belief system was there</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.570" end="00:24:12.769" style="s2">because we have to deal with an</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.000" end="00:24:14.600" style="s2">infinitely complex world and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.769" end="00:24:15.980" style="s2">simplify it down to proportions that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.600" end="00:24:18.019" style="s2">can manage because we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.980" end="00:24:19.580" style="s2">infinite cognitive or emotional or</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.019" end="00:24:22.419" style="s2">physiological resources we&#39;re very</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.419" end="00:24:26.150" style="s2">environment roughly speaking it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.679" end="00:24:28.070" style="s2">much for us and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.150" end="00:24:31.310" style="s2">we have to impose structures of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.070" end="00:24:33.830" style="s2">simplification on the world or we we get</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.310" end="00:24:37.580" style="s2">so stressed we die that&#39;s roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.830" end="00:24:38.990" style="s2">bottom line for example if you develop</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.580" end="00:24:40.490" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorder which</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.990" end="00:24:43.250" style="s2">occurs when you encounter something in</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.490" end="00:24:45.470" style="s2">your life that you cannot compute so to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.250" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">speak your body goes into emergency</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.470" end="00:24:50.930" style="s2">preparation mode which which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:53.180" style="s2">hyper hyper responsive to threat and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.930" end="00:24:54.530" style="s2">ready to do anything which is emergency</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.180" end="00:24:55.940" style="s2">preparation and that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.530" end="00:24:58.340" style="s2">physiologically demanding that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.940" end="00:25:00.440" style="s2">demolishes your health it&#39;s not merely</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.340" end="00:25:03.980" style="s2">psychological it damages your brain I</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.440" end="00:25:07.040" style="s2">mean if you just can&#39;t stay in high gear</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.980" end="00:25:10.460" style="s2">running flat out continually you you die</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.040" end="00:25:12.200" style="s2">and so people need to simplify the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.460" end="00:25:14.020" style="s2">they need to live within structures of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.200" end="00:25:16.160" style="s2">simplification because that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.020" end="00:25:18.380" style="s2">that&#39;s how they protect themselves from</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.160" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">the terrible onslaught of complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.380" end="00:25:23.330" style="s2">by the same token we organize ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:25.100" style="s2">into these these structures of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.330" end="00:25:27.500" style="s2">simplification that&#39;s what our culture&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.100" end="00:25:30.410" style="s2">are we negotiate them we inhabit them</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.500" end="00:25:32.660" style="s2">jointly and because of that when we run</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.410" end="00:25:34.100" style="s2">into people who do that differently the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.660" end="00:25:35.960" style="s2">probability that we&#39;ll engage in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.100" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">conflict is extraordinarily high because</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.960" end="00:25:40.010" style="s2">I can&#39;t give up my beliefs just because</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:41.450" style="s2">you have different beliefs and if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.010" end="00:25:42.950" style="s2">don&#39;t have the same beliefs then we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.450" end="00:25:44.780" style="s2">can&#39;t peacefully occupy the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.950" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">territory so there seems to be nothing</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.780" end="00:25:51.380" style="s2">for that except conflict if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:53.660" style="s2">negotiate then we have to fight so then</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.380" end="00:25:57.890" style="s2">I thought well that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.660" end="00:26:00.500" style="s2">then on the one hand we can abandon our</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.890" end="00:26:05.240" style="s2">belief systems because they structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.500" end="00:26:06.500" style="s2">our realities and protect us but and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.240" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">can&#39;t fight because now we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.500" end="00:26:09.320" style="s2">technologically powerful that if we do</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:11.480" style="s2">we&#39;re going to destroy everything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.320" end="00:26:13.160" style="s2">like well that&#39;s masters that&#39;s option</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.480" end="00:26:15.260" style="s2">one and it&#39;s opposite that completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.160" end="00:26:17.930" style="s2">exhausts the auctions and so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.260" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">horrible realization absolutely dreadful</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.930" end="00:26:21.020" style="s2">realization because you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:22.850" style="s2">certainly possible if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.020" end="00:26:25.160" style="s2">this from a biological or an</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.850" end="00:26:27.050" style="s2">evolutionary viewpoint is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.160" end="00:26:28.820" style="s2">kind of a peculiar species and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.050" end="00:26:30.680" style="s2">developed these terrible technologies of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.820" end="00:26:32.090" style="s2">war there&#39;s absolutely no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.680" end="00:26:34.030" style="s2">assume that we will just use them to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.090" end="00:26:37.670" style="s2">wipe ourselves out and you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.030" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">30% of us as individuals and in our own</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.670" end="00:26:39.720" style="s2">psyches would be happy about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:41.610" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.720" end="00:26:42.840" style="s2">life is pretty dreadful and it&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.610" end="00:26:44.759" style="s2">suffering and there&#39;s lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.840" end="00:26:46.289" style="s2">that are harsh about existence and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.759" end="00:26:49.230" style="s2">maybe we should just let the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.289" end="00:26:50.789" style="s2">go and believe me people are plenty</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.230" end="00:26:53.370" style="s2">motivated to do that if you haven&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.629" end="00:28:51.149" style="s2">was doing it all out fundamentally how</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.049" end="00:28:53.220" style="s2">his contention was that what had</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.149" end="00:28:55.410" style="s2">happened in the West was that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.220" end="00:28:57.450" style="s2">they&#39;re the judeo-christian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.410" end="00:29:00.090" style="s2">and even the precursors of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.450" end="00:29:04.620" style="s2">tradition upon from which that tradition</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.090" end="00:29:06.270" style="s2">emerged had insisted for millennia that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.620" end="00:29:07.920" style="s2">the pursuit of truth was the highest</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.270" end="00:29:12.690" style="s2">moral value and that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.920" end="00:29:14.850" style="s2">consequences of that was that the West</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.690" end="00:29:17.940" style="s2">developed science which was part of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.850" end="00:29:22.740" style="s2">pursuit of the truth and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.940" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">the tools of science once successfully</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.740" end="00:29:26.910" style="s2">grasped and universalized we then turned</p>

<p begin="00:29:40.830" end="00:29:44.220" style="s2">dispense with them and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.510" end="00:29:46.230" style="s2">Copernicus and that was Darwin and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.220" end="00:29:48.600" style="s2">was Freud and that was these repeated</p>

<p begin="00:30:03.900" end="00:30:10.330" style="s2">Nietzsche said something as well at the</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.330" end="00:30:18.250" style="s2">consequence he said one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.730" end="00:30:20.050" style="s2">terrible things about discovering that a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.250" end="00:30:24.430" style="s2">system you believed in no longer</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.050" end="00:30:27.370" style="s2">functions is no longer sufficient or can</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.430" end="00:30:29.860" style="s2">be undermined is that it raises the</p>

<p begin="00:30:29.860" end="00:30:36.670" style="s2">same flaws you know sometimes you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.740" end="00:30:39.430" style="s2">jump from atheism to Christianity and</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.430" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">successive leaps and and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.160" end="00:30:45.910" style="s2">someone who&#39;s faithless from within the</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.910" end="00:30:50.560" style="s2">faithful to the idea that there are in</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.070" end="00:30:52.690" style="s2">fact systems that will work but if your</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.560" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">system fails enough then you can end up</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.690" end="00:30:58.120" style="s2">in a situation where you don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">any faith in the idea that systems as</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.120" end="00:31:03.730" style="s2">such can work and that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:07.060" style="s2">nihilistic and Nietzsche saw that as as</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.730" end="00:31:11.050" style="s2">as as the origin of the specter of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.060" end="00:31:12.520" style="s2">nihilism hopelessness fundamentally now</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.050" end="00:31:14.530" style="s2">it&#39;s more complicated than that because</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.520" end="00:31:16.090" style="s2">there are underground reasons so to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.530" end="00:31:17.980" style="s2">speak for being nihilistic that have</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.090" end="00:31:21.070" style="s2">nothing to do with the mere collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.980" end="00:31:25.710" style="s2">a rational belief system and I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.070" end="00:31:31.770" style="s2">about those two and he also talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.710" end="00:31:34.900" style="s2">the the inevitable rise of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.770" end="00:31:37.090" style="s2">totalitarianism as a medication for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.900" end="00:31:38.920" style="s2">loss of all meaning in some sense you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.090" end="00:31:40.630" style="s2">might say well if you&#39;re in a chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.920" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">state because you no longer know what to</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.630" end="00:31:46.690" style="s2">believe it&#39;s very and someone offers you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:49.870" style="s2">a set of certainties to guide your life</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.690" end="00:31:52.390" style="s2">by then it&#39;s very attractive for you to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.870" end="00:31:55.510" style="s2">reach out and grip on to those with all</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.390" end="00:31:58.500" style="s2">of your soul so to speak because that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.510" end="00:32:00.700" style="s2">stops you from merely being adrift and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.500" end="00:32:04.740" style="s2">then there&#39;s underground reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.700" end="00:32:04.740" style="s2">that too that all also return to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.390" end="00:32:14.760" style="s2">so the first question is was it</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.770" end="00:32:17.250" style="s2">necessary for the sense of truth that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.760" end="00:32:19.800" style="s2">Nietzsche described as developed by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.250" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition that then</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.800" end="00:32:26.160" style="s2">manifested itself in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:28.350" style="s2">methodology to turn against the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.160" end="00:32:31.380" style="s2">foundation of that structure and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.350" end="00:32:35.880" style="s2">demolish it was that inevitable and was</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.380" end="00:32:45.750" style="s2">it correct and that&#39;s the first question</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.880" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">and so Young&#39;s answers that was the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.750" end="00:32:51.630" style="s2">conflict between science and religion is</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:55.320" style="s2">a consequence of the immature state of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.630" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">both of those domains of thinking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.320" end="00:32:59.970" style="s2">not built into the structure per se it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:01.980" style="s2">just that we aren&#39;t good enough at being</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.970" end="00:33:04.110" style="s2">religious or good enough about at being</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.980" end="00:33:06.900" style="s2">scientific in order to see how they</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.110" end="00:33:10.530" style="s2">might be reconciled now that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.900" end="00:33:13.080" style="s2">a hell of a claim and it&#39;s a frightening</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.530" end="00:33:14.970" style="s2">claim because and this speaks to some</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.080" end="00:33:17.490" style="s2">degree to the underground reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.970" end="00:33:19.020" style="s2">being nihilistic so the terrible thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.490" end="00:33:23.070" style="s2">about being nihilistic is that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.020" end="00:33:26.040" style="s2">you do has any meaning and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.070" end="00:33:28.830" style="s2">not so good because actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.040" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">actually untrue because there are forms</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.830" end="00:33:34.800" style="s2">of meaning in life that nihilism won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:36.360" style="s2">protect you from or or even increase</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.800" end="00:33:38.190" style="s2">your exposure to and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.360" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">tragic meanings of life I don&#39;t care how</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.190" end="00:33:42.300" style="s2">nihilistic you are what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:44.070" style="s2">believe in you&#39;re going to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.300" end="00:33:45.870" style="s2">your own pain you&#39;re going to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.070" end="00:33:48.210" style="s2">your own anxiety you&#39;re going to believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.870" end="00:33:49.500" style="s2">in the fact of pain and anxiety for</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.210" end="00:33:50.100" style="s2">everyone else you&#39;re going to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.500" end="00:33:52.110" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.100" end="00:33:54.180" style="s2">you can&#39;t think to yourself out of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.110" end="00:33:57.150" style="s2">catastrophe of the world by being</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.180" end="00:34:00.030" style="s2">nihilistic so the negative meanings</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.150" end="00:34:01.470" style="s2">remain you can dispense with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.030" end="00:34:03.390" style="s2">positive meanings which seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.470" end="00:34:05.610" style="s2">bad bargain but the outside of doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.390" end="00:34:06.440" style="s2">that is quite straightforward if I said</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.610" end="00:34:11.010" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.440" end="00:34:14.250" style="s2">here&#39;s your alternatives nothing you do</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.010" end="00:34:17.850" style="s2">matters or has any meaning alternative</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.250" end="00:34:20.440" style="s2">one everything you do matters and has</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.850" end="00:34:22.359" style="s2">meaning which one would you pick</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.440" end="00:34:23.549" style="s2">and you might think well of course I</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.359" end="00:34:25.929" style="s2">would go for the second alternative</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.549" end="00:34:28.210" style="s2">because the first one is so horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.929" end="00:34:29.649" style="s2">but the truth of the matter is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.210" end="00:34:32.260" style="s2">second one is even more horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.649" end="00:34:35.289" style="s2">because it means that the things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.260" end="00:34:37.659" style="s2">you do for better or worse actually do</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.289" end="00:34:39.429" style="s2">matter and in some sense you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.659" end="00:34:41.230" style="s2">responsible for them not only for the</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.419" end="00:34:47.230" style="s2">for the effect that they have radiating</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.230" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">people that your network too and also as</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.809" end="00:34:55.929" style="s2">they reach as a as a make wave through</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:57.670" style="s2">time it could be that everything you do</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.929" end="00:34:59.829" style="s2">does matter that every choice that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.670" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">make matters and I do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.829" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the case that you&#39;re constantly</p>

<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:08.200" style="s2">that that determines the destiny of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.700" style="s2">being and it isn&#39;t obvious to me at all</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.200" end="00:35:11.859" style="s2">but that&#39;s something that you would wish</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.700" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">upon yourself and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.859" end="00:35:15.480" style="s2">advantages to be nihilistic is it</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:17.650" style="s2">enables you to be totally irresponsible</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.480" end="00:35:19.710" style="s2">even though the price you pay for that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.650" end="00:35:22.359" style="s2">is the sacrifice of all positive meaning</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.710" end="00:35:25.029" style="s2">well so much for the intellectual purity</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.359" end="00:35:26.829" style="s2">of nihilism right and so those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.029" end="00:35:29.289" style="s2">things have to be considered very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.829" end="00:35:30.910" style="s2">because when someone says well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.289" end="00:35:32.589" style="s2">hopeless sometimes it&#39;s because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.910" end="00:35:33.730" style="s2">suffering and people can suffer terribly</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.589" end="00:35:36.010" style="s2">because of that but it&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.730" end="00:35:41.220" style="s2">because they don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.010" end="00:35:41.220" style="s2">responsible for anything and no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.000" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">back to use point you started to examine</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.109" end="00:35:59.559" style="s2">religious ideon I would say symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.150" end="00:36:02.799" style="s2">but it&#39;s more complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.559" end="00:36:05.260" style="s2">because you might think that the attempt</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.799" end="00:36:07.329" style="s2">to analyze religious thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.260" end="00:36:10.599" style="s2">symbolically would reduce it to nothing</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.329" end="00:36:12.700" style="s2">but psychology but that isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.599" end="00:36:14.950" style="s2">happens precisely because as you reduce</p>

<p begin="00:37:48.609" end="00:37:55.180" style="s2">say and also narrow because I think to</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.819" end="00:38:24.519" style="s2">something about it that&#39;s true and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.279" end="00:38:26.799" style="s2">truth in it seems to be its relationship</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.519" end="00:38:29.319" style="s2">to the origin of civilization because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.799" end="00:38:32.140" style="s2">is the case that civilization everywhere</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.140" end="00:38:37.569" style="s2">regard as complex and technological is</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.839" end="00:38:39.880" style="s2">about 6,000 years old and why that is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.569" end="00:38:41.589" style="s2">not so self-evident although I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.880" end="00:38:43.450" style="s2">it has something to do with how long it</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.589" end="00:38:45.220" style="s2">took us to reformulate ourselves after</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.450" end="00:38:47.390" style="s2">the last ice age which of course was</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.220" end="00:38:49.549" style="s2">only roughly 15,000 you</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.390" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">ago it&#39;s not really that far away in</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.549" end="00:38:55.849" style="s2">time so that&#39;s the first thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.400" end="00:38:57.859" style="s2">second thing is what the story the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.849" end="00:38:59.299" style="s2">creation stories in Genesis for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.859" end="00:39:00.440" style="s2">actually mean because they actually mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.299" end="00:39:03.109" style="s2">something and what they mean is</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.440" end="00:39:04.519" style="s2">absolutely remarkable in my estimation</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.109" end="00:39:08.420" style="s2">and so I&#39;m going to tell you a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.519" end="00:39:10.099" style="s2">bit about that story because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.420" end="00:39:11.960" style="s2">necessary to understand what the story</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.099" end="00:39:14.089" style="s2">means to determine if what Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.960" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">said about the inevitable destruction of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.089" end="00:39:19.730" style="s2">our symbolic religious structures by</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:21.950" style="s2">science was inevitable and necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.730" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">I think the answer to that is no we just</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.950" end="00:39:25.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand what the hell we were</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:27.079" style="s2">doing any more than we really understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.700" end="00:39:30.260" style="s2">why we put up Christmas trees at</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.079" end="00:39:32.359" style="s2">Christmas so we do that in part because</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.260" end="00:39:33.859" style="s2">the Christmas tree is a symbol of life</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.359" end="00:39:36.319" style="s2">because the tree is a symbol of life</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.859" end="00:39:37.940" style="s2">because we inhabited trees for untold</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.319" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">millions of years and we put lights on</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.940" end="00:39:43.609" style="s2">the trees to symbolize the coming back</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:46.039" style="s2">into the darkness of midwinter of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.609" end="00:39:48.230" style="s2">Sun and the light and so we play this</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.039" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">symbolic game that celebrates both life</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.230" end="00:39:51.950" style="s2">and the emergence of light and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:53.450" style="s2">consciousness and we associate that with</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.950" end="00:39:55.670" style="s2">the birth of the Savior but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.450" end="00:39:57.710" style="s2">know that we&#39;re doing that but we do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.670" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">anyways and we do that sort of thing all</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.710" end="00:40:01.369" style="s2">the time because we&#39;re smarter than we</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:03.140" style="s2">know and that has to be the case because</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.369" end="00:40:05.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t know ourselves we would need a</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.140" end="00:40:06.710" style="s2">psychology or sociology and anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.000" end="00:40:09.710" style="s2">or any of those things if we were</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.710" end="00:40:11.470" style="s2">transparent to ourselves we&#39;re machines</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.710" end="00:40:13.970" style="s2">so to speak that are far more</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.470" end="00:40:16.549" style="s2">intelligent and wise then the machines</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.970" end="00:40:18.710" style="s2">themselves can understand and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.549" end="00:40:20.450" style="s2">revealed ourselves to ourselves in our</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.710" end="00:40:22.940" style="s2">action and our symbolic gestures</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.450" end="00:40:24.500" style="s2">constantly and then have to reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.940" end="00:40:30.650" style="s2">that to try to understand what it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.500" end="00:40:35.470" style="s2">that we&#39;re up to so here&#39;s the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.650" end="00:40:37.970" style="s2">lurks at the beginning of Genesis so</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.470" end="00:40:42.009" style="s2">there&#39;s the three elements that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.970" end="00:40:45.019" style="s2">involved in the creation of habitable</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.009" end="00:40:47.089" style="s2">the creation of habitable order from</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.019" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">chaos at the beginning of time one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.089" end="00:40:51.920" style="s2">them is whatever is represented by God</p>

<p begin="00:40:51.920" end="00:40:56.539" style="s2">is represented by the chaos that exists</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.380" end="00:40:58.940" style="s2">at the same time and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.539" end="00:40:59.990" style="s2">whatever is represented by the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.940" end="00:41:01.190" style="s2">God&#39;s Word</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.990" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the logos from</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:06.470" style="s2">very strange idea so there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.339" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">that was developed over the course of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.470" end="00:41:12.770" style="s2">thousands of years that the redeeming</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:14.599" style="s2">savior was also the thing that God used</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.770" end="00:41:16.849" style="s2">to extract habitable order out of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.599" end="00:41:20.630" style="s2">at the beginning of time it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.849" end="00:41:22.970" style="s2">strange idea and to to assimilate an</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.630" end="00:41:25.910" style="s2">idea of that preposterous nough sand</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.089" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">means but it means something utterly</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.540" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">profound and it means something that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">cannot forget we forget it at our peril</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.589" end="00:41:46.069" style="s2">the story at the beginning of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.510" end="00:41:47.930" style="s2">means that structure that&#39;s the father</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.660" end="00:48:53.150" style="s2">it&#39;s an ancient ancient idea and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.560" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">reason that we haven&#39;t forgotten it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.150" end="00:49:00.500" style="s2">because everyone who forgot it died so</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.500" end="00:49:04.570" style="s2">better stop forgetting about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.339" end="00:49:16.520" style="s2">Nietzsche said that after God had died</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.140" end="00:49:19.099" style="s2">there would be two things that would</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.520" end="00:49:21.470" style="s2">happen one would be the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.099" end="00:49:23.630" style="s2">nihilism as a temptation we already</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.470" end="00:49:25.460" style="s2">discussed nihilism it&#39;s like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.630" end="00:49:27.260" style="s2">logical consequence of the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.460" end="00:49:31.240" style="s2">value systems but it&#39;s also a place for</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.260" end="00:49:32.660" style="s2">the irresponsible to hide fine nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.240" end="00:49:37.700" style="s2">totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.660" end="00:49:39.319" style="s2">well Nietzsche believed that once you</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.700" end="00:49:41.480" style="s2">had experienced the collapse of one</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.319" end="00:49:43.849" style="s2">value system you were unlikely to put</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.849" end="00:49:50.839" style="s2">why totalitarianism particularly say it</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.540" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">it&#39;s nationalistic and communitarian</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.839" end="00:49:57.829" style="s2">forms which are the two forms that we</p>

<p begin="00:50:00.230" end="00:50:04.460" style="s2">pushed most forcefully forward by the</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.460" end="00:50:08.540" style="s2">exemplified by the Nazis and with</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.500" end="00:50:10.040" style="s2">communitarianism being put forth by the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.540" end="00:50:12.200" style="s2">sorts of trees that were exemplified by</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.200" end="00:50:21.470" style="s2">catastrophic evolutionary dead ends well</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.490" end="00:50:25.190" style="s2">nationalism is easier to understand I</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.470" end="00:50:27.950" style="s2">think because you need an identity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.190" end="00:50:30.140" style="s2">it has to be collective because human</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.950" end="00:50:33.140" style="s2">beings live collectively I mean it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.140" end="00:50:35.059" style="s2">fact that we share an identity that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.140" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">can all sit here in this room peacefully</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.059" end="00:50:39.740" style="s2">because the identity is partly who you</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:41.299" style="s2">think you are but it&#39;s also partly what</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.740" end="00:50:44.990" style="s2">you expect from the world and from</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.299" end="00:50:46.849" style="s2">others and because you have an identity</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.990" end="00:50:49.940" style="s2">that&#39;s similar to you you can sit</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.849" end="00:50:51.710" style="s2">together peacefully because you expect</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.940" end="00:50:53.630" style="s2">and desire something and so to you and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.710" end="00:50:55.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing and that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.630" end="00:50:57.650" style="s2">means to have a shared culture and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.640" end="00:51:00.200" style="s2">you can&#39;t you have to defend that</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.650" end="00:51:02.809" style="s2">culture and it has to be a sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.200" end="00:51:04.700" style="s2">let&#39;s say tightness or magnitude so that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.809" end="00:51:08.270" style="s2">it makes sense for you to belong to it</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.700" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not so diverse and chaotic that it</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.270" end="00:51:13.190" style="s2">means nothing and I think that part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:15.530" style="s2">the reason why we&#39;re seeing a return to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.190" end="00:51:19.220" style="s2">nationalism in places like Europe is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.530" end="00:51:21.890" style="s2">because the European identity is so</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.220" end="00:51:23.270" style="s2">amorphous that people can&#39;t establish a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.890" end="00:51:24.619" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.270" end="00:51:26.329" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a good thing because</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.619" end="00:51:28.280" style="s2">identity is actually something you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.329" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">to have a relationship with and so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.280" end="00:51:31.579" style="s2">know it&#39;s the identity or identity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:34.220" style="s2">the identity of you within your family</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.579" end="00:51:36.349" style="s2">it&#39;s the identity of your family within</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.220" end="00:51:37.880" style="s2">the small community their friends and</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.349" end="00:51:39.829" style="s2">that surround you and then the broader</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.880" end="00:51:41.510" style="s2">community of the town and the somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.829" end="00:51:43.940" style="s2">broader community of the province and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.510" end="00:51:46.700" style="s2">the state and so forth but as it expands</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.940" end="00:51:49.160" style="s2">it gets vague and it disperses and at</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.700" end="00:51:51.109" style="s2">some point the identity that&#39;s universal</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.160" end="00:51:54.050" style="s2">is so all-encompassing that it means</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.109" end="00:51:56.030" style="s2">nothing at all and leaves people chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.050" end="00:51:57.800" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what&#39;s happening at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.030" end="00:51:59.210" style="s2">in part in Europe it&#39;s happening to some</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.800" end="00:52:02.210" style="s2">degree in the United States as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.210" end="00:52:04.010" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been pushed so quickly</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.210" end="00:52:07.430" style="s2">forward into adopting a global identity</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.010" end="00:52:09.410" style="s2">that people are shaking because that too</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.430" end="00:52:11.240" style="s2">amorphous for them until we pull back</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.410" end="00:52:14.180" style="s2">and say no we need to be around people</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.240" end="00:52:17.869" style="s2">who we understand which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.180" end="00:52:20.210" style="s2">absolutely true now the downside of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.869" end="00:52:22.520" style="s2">nationalist endeavor is that you also</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.210" end="00:52:25.010" style="s2">need to be around people that you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.520" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">alike and don&#39;t understand partly</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.010" end="00:52:28.010" style="s2">because they exist and if you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:29.630" style="s2">them into account then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.010" end="00:52:31.339" style="s2">have a war with them which is a very bad</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.630" end="00:52:33.260" style="s2">idea but also because they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.339" end="00:52:35.859" style="s2">something to offer and so we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.260" end="00:52:38.990" style="s2">to sort out the proper balance between</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.859" end="00:52:40.849" style="s2">differentiated identity say at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.990" end="00:52:42.680" style="s2">nation-state level and the global</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.849" end="00:52:44.660" style="s2">identity that seems to be manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.680" end="00:52:47.170" style="s2">itself partly because of our widespread</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.660" end="00:52:49.490" style="s2">electronic communication so okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.170" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">nationalism beckons if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.490" end="00:52:52.970" style="s2">chaotic state you know I heard the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">Gallup people with pollsters at one</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.970" end="00:52:56.420" style="s2">point I&#39;ve never seen this made public</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:53:02.240" style="s2">but I remember it very well</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.420" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">said that uh as was back when Quebec was</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:06.530" style="s2">still a large proportion that Kaiba</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:08.599" style="s2">Corps population was still agitating for</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.530" end="00:53:09.890" style="s2">separatism I&#39;d always looked at that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.599" end="00:53:14.420" style="s2">I thought what made perfect sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.890" end="00:53:16.069" style="s2">because you solecism collapses it leaves</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.420" end="00:53:18.530" style="s2">a void what are you going to fill the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.069" end="00:53:21.430" style="s2">void with well to denialism which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.530" end="00:53:23.930" style="s2">already discussed or well or what well</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.430" end="00:53:25.310" style="s2">nationalism obviously and the Gallup</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.930" end="00:53:27.050" style="s2">people said that if you are lapsed</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.310" end="00:53:29.540" style="s2">Catholic you were ten times more likely</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.050" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">to be a separatist perfect exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.540" end="00:53:33.710" style="s2">you&#39;d expect because you have to have an</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:36.230" style="s2">identity so you turn from church to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.710" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">state well that&#39;s fine if you believe</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.230" end="00:53:39.270" style="s2">that the state</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:41.700" style="s2">is the ultimate identity and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.270" end="00:53:43.349" style="s2">really that the story that is being sold</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.700" end="00:53:45.960" style="s2">to people who are sold a nationalist</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.349" end="00:53:48.030" style="s2">story the state is the ultimate identity</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.960" end="00:53:50.700" style="s2">it&#39;s like well actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.030" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">technically wrong that&#39;s why that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.700" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s not wrong because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">ideologically wrong or or morally wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:53:58.619" style="s2">precisely it&#39;s it&#39;s wrong because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:00.359" style="s2">technically wrong because the problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.619" end="00:54:04.920" style="s2">with the state is the state is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.359" end="00:54:06.869" style="s2">uniform across people and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.920" end="00:54:09.510" style="s2">is that we need what&#39;s actually diverse</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.869" end="00:54:11.910" style="s2">across people in order to rejuvenate the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.510" end="00:54:14.460" style="s2">state and to keep it awake and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.910" end="00:54:16.950" style="s2">reduce individuals to what&#39;s homogenous</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.460" end="00:54:18.900" style="s2">about them across all people you</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.950" end="00:54:21.150" style="s2">eradicate the very variability that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.900" end="00:54:23.339" style="s2">allows people to adapt to new things and</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.150" end="00:54:25.290" style="s2">because we&#39;re constantly being presented</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.339" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">with new things we need to keep that</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.290" end="00:54:32.069" style="s2">individual variability paramount because</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:33.780" style="s2">it&#39;s upon that variability that the very</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.069" end="00:54:35.910" style="s2">state depends and not actually what the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.780" end="00:54:38.430" style="s2">West discovered that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.910" end="00:54:40.859" style="s2">always subordinated the state to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.430" end="00:54:43.740" style="s2">divinity of the individual and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.859" end="00:54:46.619" style="s2">expressed as I already said in our in</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.740" end="00:54:49.500" style="s2">our in the primacy of free speech in our</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.619" end="00:54:51.720" style="s2">civilization it&#39;s the cornerstone the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.500" end="00:54:53.790" style="s2">primacy of free speech and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.720" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">the individual has something to offer</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.790" end="00:54:58.500" style="s2">the state and so state identity is</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:00.299" style="s2">something that can only it can structure</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.500" end="00:55:03.420" style="s2">and it can reassure but it also</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.299" end="00:55:05.660" style="s2">constrains to too great a degree and so</p>

<p begin="01:07:56.540" end="01:08:03.710" style="s2">is life so terrible that it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.930" end="01:08:06.440" style="s2">exist well the answer is it depends on</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.710" end="01:08:08.120" style="s2">how you live it and if your life is so</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.440" end="01:08:09.980" style="s2">terrible that you can&#39;t bear it then it</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.120" end="01:08:12.290" style="s2">raises the question of whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.980" end="01:08:15.110" style="s2">you&#39;re living it properly and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.290" end="01:08:17.240" style="s2">to say that people don&#39;t suffer under</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.110" end="01:08:19.540" style="s2">burdens that are too great for them to</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.240" end="01:08:23.150" style="s2">bear they certainly do it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.540" end="01:08:25.400" style="s2">because if you let that in bitter you if</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.150" end="01:08:27.650" style="s2">you let that destroy your religions to</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.400" end="01:08:32.740" style="s2">the proper path all it does is make that</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.650" end="01:08:32.740" style="s2">worse and everything else it&#39;s no out</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.079" end="01:08:50.190" style="s2">so what did I learn from studying from</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.480" end="01:08:52.440" style="s2">studying the terrible situation that</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.190" end="01:08:56.609" style="s2">obtained in the mid-1980s when the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.440" end="01:09:00.359" style="s2">Soviets and the West had tens of</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.609" end="01:09:02.279" style="s2">thousands of hydrogen bombs pointed at</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.359" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">each other ready to go at a moment&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.279" end="01:09:06.509" style="s2">notice why did that happen what did I</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:10.520" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.509" end="01:09:14.730" style="s2">it was simple the reason that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.520" end="01:09:17.549" style="s2">situation existed was because I was not</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.730" end="01:09:19.290" style="s2">good enough I was not good enough the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.549" end="01:09:21.210" style="s2">reason that the terrible situations in</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.290" end="01:09:23.040" style="s2">the world exist now is because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.210" end="01:09:25.889" style="s2">not good enough you&#39;re not good enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.040" end="01:09:29.130" style="s2">you&#39;re not good enough we could solve</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.889" end="01:09:30.540" style="s2">any problem you can solve any problem if</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.130" end="01:09:32.639" style="s2">we used all the resources that were</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.540" end="01:09:34.889" style="s2">available to us if we live properly we</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.639" end="01:09:42.960" style="s2">have no idea what we could turn what</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.889" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">we&#39;re in into so I would say you support</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.960" end="01:09:49.139" style="s2">free speech because it&#39;s the mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:54.270" style="s2">that maintains the sanity of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.139" end="01:09:56.909" style="s2">individual and society and you live in</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.270" end="01:09:58.920" style="s2">relationship with the spoken truth to</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.909" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">the best of your ability because the</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.920" end="01:10:05.849" style="s2">alternative is hell and if hell is what</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:08.040" style="s2">you want then you can remain arrogant</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.849" end="01:10:09.750" style="s2">and resentful and deceitful but if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.040" end="01:10:12.750" style="s2">want to work to better the world to</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.750" end="01:10:16.290" style="s2">bring it up to what it might be then you</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.750" end="01:10:19.380" style="s2">speak forthrightly you clarify yourself</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.290" end="01:10:22.650" style="s2">and you act properly in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.380" end="01:10:25.440" style="s2">then you see what happens and this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.650" end="01:10:27.090" style="s2">the final thing I&#39;ll say I spent a long</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.440" end="01:10:29.300" style="s2">time studying the Sermon on the Mount</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.090" end="01:10:33.090" style="s2">it&#39;s a key document</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.300" end="01:10:35.670" style="s2">it&#39;s Christ&#39;s commentary on the 10</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.090" end="01:10:38.639" style="s2">commandments in a sense the question</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.670" end="01:10:40.679" style="s2">being if you codify the rules by which a</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.639" end="01:10:42.659" style="s2">society might function is there</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.679" end="01:10:44.940" style="s2">something within the structure of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.659" end="01:10:46.590" style="s2">rules that rises above them that acts as</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.940" end="01:10:49.110" style="s2">the fundamental principle from which</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.590" end="01:10:51.090" style="s2">they&#39;re all derived it&#39;s the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.110" end="01:10:53.909" style="s2">question of human ethics what is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.090" end="01:10:55.349" style="s2">highest principle an answer that&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.909" end="01:10:57.020" style="s2">forth in the Sermon on the Mount is</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.349" end="01:10:59.369" style="s2">quite straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.020" end="01:11:01.710" style="s2">and at the highest possible good that</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.369" end="01:11:03.630" style="s2">you can conceive of whatever that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.710" end="01:11:06.679" style="s2">that you can conceive them that serves</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.630" end="01:11:09.829" style="s2">as your God for all intents and purposes</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.679" end="01:11:13.980" style="s2">having aligned yourself with that good</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.829" end="01:11:17.460" style="s2">speak the truth and see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.980" end="01:11:20.849" style="s2">that&#39;s the act of faith the act of faith</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.460" end="01:11:23.520" style="s2">is whatever the truth reveals is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.849" end="01:11:26.460" style="s2">best of all possible worlds regardless</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.520" end="01:11:28.440" style="s2">of how it appears to you now it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.460" end="01:11:32.070" style="s2">guess right it&#39;s something you stake a</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.440" end="01:11:33.780" style="s2">back on well what do you think the best</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.070" end="01:11:36.840" style="s2">of all possible worlds will be brought</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.780" end="01:11:38.670" style="s2">into being by defeat it seems unlikely</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.840" end="01:11:40.530" style="s2">you know that doesn&#39;t work in your own</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.670" end="01:11:43.170" style="s2">life you tangle yourself up in your own</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.530" end="01:11:45.030" style="s2">lies right one lie breeds 10 and 10</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.170" end="01:11:46.679" style="s2">breeds 100 and maybe you put the</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.030" end="01:11:48.570" style="s2">consequences on down the road and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.679" end="01:11:50.280" style="s2">don&#39;t fall into the pit for five or six</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.570" end="01:11:52.199" style="s2">years maybe you&#39;ll even forgotten why</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.280" end="01:11:54.510" style="s2">you fell in when you finally do fall in</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.199" end="01:11:56.460" style="s2">but everyone knows that everyone knows</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.510" end="01:12:00.000" style="s2">that you don&#39;t get away with anything</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.460" end="01:12:02.159" style="s2">and so the issue is well what would</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.000" end="01:12:05.099" style="s2">happen if you just said what you thought</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.159" end="01:12:07.230" style="s2">stupid as it is inaccurate as it is and</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.099" end="01:12:09.210" style="s2">listen to people criticize you in</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.230" end="01:12:10.829" style="s2">response to shape you and make you more</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.210" end="01:12:13.290" style="s2">articulate what would your life be like</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.829" end="01:12:15.869" style="s2">and answer that is and I know this to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.290" end="01:12:18.570" style="s2">true I&#39;ve worked with many many people</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.869" end="01:12:21.389" style="s2">on precisely this problem your life gets</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.570" end="01:12:25.020" style="s2">better and better and better and richer</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.389" end="01:12:26.780" style="s2">and deeper but that comes with a heavier</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.020" end="01:12:30.540" style="s2">and heavier burden of responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.780" end="01:12:32.099" style="s2">well that&#39;s okay you use the observation</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.540" end="01:12:35.400" style="s2">of your own capability to bear</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.099" end="01:12:38.159" style="s2">responsibility to buttress yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.400" end="01:12:42.840" style="s2">against the terrors of being finite you</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.159" end="01:12:45.840" style="s2">say weak and miserable as I am I can</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.840" end="01:12:49.349" style="s2">still stand up to the terrible tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.840" end="01:12:54.139" style="s2">of life and prevail and that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.349" end="01:12:54.139" style="s2">enough thank you</p>
