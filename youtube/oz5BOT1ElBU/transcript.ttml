<p begin="00:07:24.570" end="00:07:27.870" style="s2">that is the world to transcend is and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.670" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">that&#39;s nothing about the machines</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:36.000" style="s2">hopefully so we need to think about what</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.990" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">it just means human and what humans</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.000" end="00:07:39.200" style="s2">communicate with you must to create a</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.870" end="00:07:58.290" style="s2">basically a perfect container for</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.160" end="00:08:00.750" style="s2">anybody who wants to fill up a container</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.290" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">with some content so you got to start</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.750" end="00:08:05.130" style="s2">talking about the contents over later</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:06.090" style="s2">and you cannot avoid the content but if</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.130" end="00:08:07.650" style="s2">you&#39;re going to talk about the content</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.090" end="00:08:10.530" style="s2">you cannot avoid three things you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.650" end="00:08:13.110" style="s2">avoid Marx and class analysis you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.530" end="00:08:15.150" style="s2">avoid Nietzsche and power analysis that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.110" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">includes for coal for example and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.150" end="00:08:19.890" style="s2">can certainly normal Freud and sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:22.710" style="s2">which also means that any system you</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.890" end="00:08:24.540" style="s2">sort of create or fantasize about in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.710" end="00:08:26.640" style="s2">plate honest way will fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.540" end="00:08:29.010" style="s2">instantly because that&#39;s the lesson from</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.640" end="00:08:31.050" style="s2">Hegel is that bacon is fantasies will</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.010" end="00:08:32.940" style="s2">never hold because sexuality will make</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.940" end="00:08:38.220" style="s2">what you can do is temporarily create an</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.720" end="00:08:39.630" style="s2">emergent platform of some kind from</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.220" end="00:08:42.060" style="s2">which you can achieve greater things</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.630" end="00:08:43.830" style="s2">okay now how do you go about doing this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.060" end="00:08:46.200" style="s2">this is where it gets interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.830" end="00:08:48.430" style="s2">and I&#39;ve talked a lot about the child</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.200" end="00:08:51.250" style="s2">the dolt of the god</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.430" end="00:08:53.650" style="s2">right ya know when you listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.250" end="00:08:57.520" style="s2">Warka he talks about the child the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.650" end="00:08:59.590" style="s2">Dalton the sage mm-hmm he&#39;s creating a</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.590" end="00:09:03.700" style="s2">wants to avoid the God word he wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.630" end="00:09:05.860" style="s2">savoyard any any anything remotely close</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.700" end="00:09:07.660" style="s2">to that probably because it has enough</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.660" end="00:09:12.100" style="s2">in North America it&#39;s a very common</p>

<p begin="00:09:12.100" end="00:09:15.220" style="s2">things well he said in his recent</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.450" end="00:09:16.810" style="s2">lecture that he did mind using the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.220" end="00:09:18.850" style="s2">sacred but he didn&#39;t like using the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.810" end="00:09:21.900" style="s2">like divine or he doesn&#39;t like any of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.850" end="00:09:25.570" style="s2">these like yeah you and I love those</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.900" end="00:09:28.330" style="s2">personally III III want to speak I want</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.570" end="00:09:31.510" style="s2">to use let&#39;s say romantic language to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.330" end="00:09:34.930" style="s2">describe things not romantic in a cheesy</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.510" end="00:09:39.310" style="s2">sense but poetic language or sure it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.930" end="00:09:41.740" style="s2">very dry analytical stuff yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.310" end="00:09:44.380" style="s2">point is here while for VAR can Hall</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.740" end="00:09:45.550" style="s2">discuss a religion without religion we</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.380" end="00:09:46.930" style="s2">look at the other way around we</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.550" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">basically said we&#39;ve had religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:52.840" style="s2">without religion for way too long right</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:54.520" style="s2">we need proper religion what are you</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.840" end="00:09:55.810" style="s2">afraid of what are we afraid of God why</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.520" end="00:09:57.490" style="s2">are you afraid of religion these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.810" end="00:10:00.370" style="s2">just words to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.490" end="00:10:02.680" style="s2">what were they originally how them be</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.370" end="00:10:05.050" style="s2">defined since then what is the impact on</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.680" end="00:10:07.150" style="s2">these words then later and can we go</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.050" end="00:10:08.770" style="s2">back to the original etymological</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.150" end="00:10:11.080" style="s2">genealogical meaning and could it make</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.770" end="00:10:13.570" style="s2">sense to us today okay so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.080" end="00:10:18.250" style="s2">difference between child adult and sage</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.570" end="00:10:20.250" style="s2">and child adult and God mm-hmm what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.250" end="00:10:24.730" style="s2">the difference between those two chains</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.250" end="00:10:27.960" style="s2">well sage sages is more of a humanized</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.730" end="00:10:33.400" style="s2">notion isn&#39;t it yes it&#39;s a priest right</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.960" end="00:10:36.010" style="s2">okay so maybe there are four maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.400" end="00:10:41.530" style="s2">should combine the two and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.010" end="00:10:44.380" style="s2">child adult priests God mm-hmm okay that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.530" end="00:10:46.210" style="s2">means the child aspires if the phallic</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.380" end="00:10:49.510" style="s2">transition has worked at one year of age</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.210" end="00:10:51.820" style="s2">as Freud says then the child aspires to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.510" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">one day be an adult and they should stay</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.820" end="00:10:55.450" style="s2">within that realm</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:58.390" style="s2">that&#39;s childhood okay you don&#39;t want him</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.450" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">to fear with that if you throw anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.390" end="00:11:01.779" style="s2">to adulting to the child&#39;s world too</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:03.670" style="s2">early you have pornography</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.779" end="00:11:05.319" style="s2">three-year-olds and you have computer</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.670" end="00:11:06.660" style="s2">wargames for two-year-olds or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.319" end="00:11:09.069" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to do that right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.660" end="00:11:12.579" style="s2">children are allowed to be children okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.069" end="00:11:14.230" style="s2">to aspire to become adults the adult can</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.579" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">then according to variety correcting</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.230" end="00:11:18.850" style="s2">aspire to become conversation raised</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:21.189" style="s2">because not to be compensates but to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.850" end="00:11:24.610" style="s2">come to become something similar or</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.189" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">mimic because the sage inspires the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.610" end="00:11:30.519" style="s2">adult to be more independent stronger</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:32.970" style="s2">you know more responsible you&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.519" end="00:11:34.899" style="s2">bit stronger ducks go from a young</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.970" end="00:11:39.009" style="s2">self-obsessed adult towards somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.899" end="00:11:41.589" style="s2">caring larger and it was wisdom I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.009" end="00:11:44.439" style="s2">say a sage sort of dismantles the ego</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.589" end="00:11:46.870" style="s2">and also provides encouragement and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.439" end="00:11:49.029" style="s2">difference we would especially today</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.870" end="00:11:51.420" style="s2">because we have narcissism as a massive</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.029" end="00:11:53.860" style="s2">problem in young people so so the sage</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.420" end="00:11:57.309" style="s2">where the priest is the third step now</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.860" end="00:11:59.559" style="s2">the priest can aspire for the divine and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.309" end="00:12:02.019" style="s2">this is the interesting thing in any</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.559" end="00:12:04.899" style="s2">culture outside of contemporary Western</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.019" end="00:12:06.970" style="s2">culture you would be very adamant that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.899" end="00:12:08.920" style="s2">these four steps have to be you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.970" end="00:12:12.189" style="s2">go through them so the child cannot</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.920" end="00:12:14.559" style="s2">aspire to be sage and the child must</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.189" end="00:12:15.850" style="s2">certainly not aspire to be God because</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.559" end="00:12:19.209" style="s2">that&#39;s when disaster strikes</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.850" end="00:12:21.550" style="s2">so the problem though is that while that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.209" end="00:12:23.079" style="s2">is wisdom I would say daddy&#39;s historical</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.550" end="00:12:24.370" style="s2">wisdom to actually go through those four</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.079" end="00:12:26.620" style="s2">stages and look at them separate the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.370" end="00:12:28.089" style="s2">meaning there&#39;s something mistaken about</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.620" end="00:12:30.939" style="s2">a culture where we believe you have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.089" end="00:12:32.949" style="s2">direct access to God right because we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.939" end="00:12:34.600" style="s2">don&#39;t mm-hmm the priest did we go to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.949" end="00:12:36.509" style="s2">priest the priest sucks I totally agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.600" end="00:12:39.550" style="s2">go through the priests it&#39;s a gradual</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.509" end="00:12:41.949" style="s2">step-by-step you know persons that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.550" end="00:12:44.009" style="s2">that&#39;s why sort of individualist</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.949" end="00:12:46.660" style="s2">religion freaks people out because</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.009" end="00:12:49.209" style="s2">that&#39;s what Catholicism as Saints</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.660" end="00:12:51.639" style="s2">you know polytheism is essentially just</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.209" end="00:12:53.679" style="s2">a recognition that there&#39;s a step</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.639" end="00:12:55.300" style="s2">between adult and God and that step is</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.679" end="00:12:57.069" style="s2">called the priest or the sage so you go</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.300" end="00:12:58.449" style="s2">to the priest for the priest talks to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.069" end="00:13:00.759" style="s2">God you talk to the priest and with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.449" end="00:13:01.959" style="s2">priest dies the priest if it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.759" end="00:13:04.509" style="s2">priest becomes a saint</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.959" end="00:13:06.579" style="s2">it&#39;s a go-between function right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.509" end="00:13:08.800" style="s2">important because otherwise we do not</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.579" end="00:13:11.230" style="s2">have a chain that actually explains how</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.800" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">wisdom emerges and where you can find</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.230" end="00:13:14.529" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:15.670" style="s2">so if Vericut takes a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.529" end="00:13:18.040" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.670" end="00:13:19.780" style="s2">towards Westerly on top of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.040" end="00:13:21.580" style="s2">which in turn is on top of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.780" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">that we would probably say no take</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.580" end="00:13:25.270" style="s2">intelligence separately and we can then</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">nurture intelligence immensely with</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.270" end="00:13:30.390" style="s2">machines and things but we take</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:33.610" style="s2">transcendence as the other will and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.390" end="00:13:35.800" style="s2">transcendence is to aspire to get higher</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.610" end="00:13:40.600" style="s2">through the hierarchy and reach towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.800" end="00:13:42.190" style="s2">the divine mm-hmm okay and what two</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.600" end="00:13:44.620" style="s2">machines have to do with transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.190" end="00:13:49.330" style="s2">we can lead no they don&#39;t we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.620" end="00:13:51.190" style="s2">with the intelligence machines can be ok</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.330" end="00:13:54.310" style="s2">ok ok let&#39;s go back and see how that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.190" end="00:13:56.830" style="s2">works with Aristotelian Casas so we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.310" end="00:13:58.450" style="s2">the formal costs we have material cause</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.830" end="00:14:00.400" style="s2">through the efficient cost and the final</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.450" end="00:14:02.470" style="s2">cost and Aristotle we&#39;ve all talked a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.400" end="00:14:03.820" style="s2">lot about the return to consolidate is</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.470" end="00:14:05.830" style="s2">incredibly important today</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.820" end="00:14:07.630" style="s2">now what would those four things be</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.830" end="00:14:10.600" style="s2">today we would probably say formal calls</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.630" end="00:14:12.940" style="s2">it&#39;s architecture of a plan right</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.600" end="00:14:15.280" style="s2">drawing what are we gonna do right</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.940" end="00:14:16.900" style="s2">formal cost goes into material cost</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.280" end="00:14:18.790" style="s2">which is where&#39;s the building material</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.900" end="00:14:21.340" style="s2">what are we gonna build this from where</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.790" end="00:14:22.750" style="s2">where have we dug out the material or or</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.340" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">you know the ideas and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.750" end="00:14:26.620" style="s2">we can build something on right it can</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:28.420" style="s2">be a book of like a Bible it could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.620" end="00:14:30.220" style="s2">building like a temple doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.420" end="00:14:31.900" style="s2">same principle the third one is</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.220" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">sufficient cause how do you put this to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.900" end="00:14:37.450" style="s2">life wait we throw blood or energy or I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:39.310" style="s2">don&#39;t trust your water or something</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.450" end="00:14:41.590" style="s2">through the system so it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.310" end="00:14:43.270" style="s2">system that has a flow that goes through</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.590" end="00:14:45.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a change starts occurring within</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.270" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">the system that&#39;s efficient cost for you</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.310" end="00:14:49.630" style="s2">now the fourth and last one is final</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:51.280" style="s2">cost and what the Greeks share with</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.630" end="00:14:54.780" style="s2">today&#39;s Americans is that they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.280" end="00:14:58.120" style="s2">very scared of sexualizing the cosmos so</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.780" end="00:15:00.750" style="s2">okay maybe then final cause what pulls</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.120" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">us forward as if it was there already</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.750" end="00:15:06.250" style="s2">but basically you throw the idea into</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:07.480" style="s2">the future and that will then pull you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.250" end="00:15:09.940" style="s2">forward so it&#39;s not like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.480" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">something there to pull you there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.940" end="00:15:15.370" style="s2">why God is not something that exists the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:17.950" style="s2">concept you throw forward and you strive</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.370" end="00:15:19.660" style="s2">towards it and because of that you will</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.950" end="00:15:22.660" style="s2">walk in the right direction and end up</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.660" end="00:15:26.170" style="s2">in the promised land so so if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.660" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">sexualize the final cost god forbid we</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.170" end="00:15:32.300" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:35.149" style="s2">we have two final causes one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.300" end="00:15:37.790" style="s2">the magical final costs the magical</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.149" end="00:15:39.050" style="s2">circular religion that you know Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:41.480" style="s2">and Christianity will enjoy that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.009" end="00:15:53.629" style="s2">magical stuff so they would think about</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.380" end="00:30:12.789" style="s2">so if needs to kill the Protestant god</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.610" end="00:30:14.830" style="s2">man one of my mentees Mike annex on</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.789" end="00:30:16.600" style="s2">brilliant young Swedish Marxist he said</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.830" end="00:30:18.520" style="s2">it just he said what do people believe</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.600" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">Nietzsche was an atheist yet they</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.520" end="00:30:21.460" style="s2">haven&#39;t even read Nietzsche understood</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:23.980" style="s2">him no because Nietzsche kills his own</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.460" end="00:30:26.409" style="s2">father&#39;s Protestant God mm-hmm he</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.980" end="00:30:28.330" style="s2">basically leads Christianity from on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.409" end="00:30:30.669" style="s2">forward to a corrupt Catholicism which</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.330" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">then results in a Protestantism results</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.669" end="00:30:35.140" style="s2">and somebody being literate being able</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:37.720" style="s2">to read the sacred text for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.140" end="00:30:38.980" style="s2">and thereby beginning to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.720" end="00:30:40.750" style="s2">they as individuals have a direct</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.980" end="00:30:42.429" style="s2">contact with God identifying with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.750" end="00:30:44.649" style="s2">Christ figure and it suddenly realizes</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.649" end="00:30:47.770" style="s2">survive this is just a god for the meat</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.330" end="00:30:49.510" style="s2">this is not a heroic God</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.770" end="00:30:52.450" style="s2">so Nietzsche understands to Chris</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.510" end="00:30:54.900" style="s2">he&#39;s doomed and he was built in into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.450" end="00:30:57.070" style="s2">religion because it lacked the phallic</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.010" end="00:31:09.430" style="s2">about the child and the mother delivery</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.240" end="00:31:11.140" style="s2">station the man is crucified I guess is</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.430" end="00:31:13.030" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying he&#39;s not even a man</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.140" end="00:31:14.590" style="s2">he&#39;s a young youngster do you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.030" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">Jesus even was allowed to have sex</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.590" end="00:31:18.100" style="s2">before was crucified well if it was that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">that would be against st. Augustine so</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.100" end="00:31:21.610" style="s2">st. Paul&#39;s fantasies to begin with so</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:24.490" style="s2">obviously these are Gnostics and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.610" end="00:31:25.150" style="s2">Platonists who love Jesus to die as a</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.490" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">and the Jesus child and then you see the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.260" end="00:31:37.240" style="s2">youngster on the cross with his mother</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:39.880" style="s2">next to him you see mother son the</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.880" end="00:31:43.780" style="s2">from the very beginning because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.590" end="00:31:47.380" style="s2">father has become the state he&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.780" end="00:31:49.660" style="s2">of the religion hmm that is the full</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.380" end="00:31:51.190" style="s2">Nietzschean take they don&#39;t even need</p>
