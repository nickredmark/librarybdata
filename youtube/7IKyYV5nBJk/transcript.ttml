<p begin="00:00:25.410" end="00:00:29.550" style="s2">problems and to me this is just tragic</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.510" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have free markets</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.550" end="00:00:34.739" style="s2">anymore and we certainly don&#39;t use real</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.070" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">what the outcomes might be simply by</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.320" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">studying what they did and comparing it</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">to what we are doing today so while I</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:03.930" style="s2">was in Germany I decided to stop by one</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">of my favorite museums and take you on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.930" end="00:01:09.000" style="s2">kind of crash course of the history of</p>

<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">money museum in Germany and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.700" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">of the best museums I have ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:24.600" style="s2">right at the very beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">museum you walk in and it starts with</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.600" end="00:01:29.820" style="s2">Bartok you know originally the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">form of currency was livestock the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.820" end="00:01:34.259" style="s2">problem with livestock though like for</p>

<p begin="00:01:34.259" end="00:01:38.100" style="s2">to you for something and somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">wants to trade you something else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:43.229" style="s2">of much lower value you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">change a system that relies on barter is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.229" end="00:01:46.759" style="s2">very inefficient because you not only</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:49.229" style="s2">suffer from the problems of divisibility</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.759" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">you also rely on the hope that you will</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.229" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">find someone who has a good or service</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">that you need who wants something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">you have at the same place and at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">same time in economics this is called</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">the coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">once now had the fact that most Goods</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">have a shelf life before they perish and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">you can see why barter systems held</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">mankind back for so long so what was it</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:14.220" style="s2">that solved the coincidence of once and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:16.709" style="s2">propelled us out of the Stone Age and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.220" end="00:02:20.370" style="s2">into space it was the invention of money</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.709" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">money is not evil it is a magnificent</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.370" end="00:02:24.270" style="s2">tool that allows us to trade our</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:27.300" style="s2">specialized skills and to store our</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.270" end="00:02:29.070" style="s2">economic energy without it we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.300" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">struggling to feed ourselves each day</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.070" end="00:02:34.350" style="s2">and our average lifespan would still be</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:36.300" style="s2">30 in episode one we learned that real</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.350" end="00:02:39.300" style="s2">money has to fulfill certain properties</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">in order to function the 2600 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.300" end="00:02:44.850" style="s2">after its emergence people still confuse</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:48.660" style="s2">money with currency even the so called</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.850" end="00:02:52.019" style="s2">experts so they&#39;ve got here some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:54.620" style="s2">things about what money is the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.019" end="00:02:58.140" style="s2">example here is money is whatever goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.620" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">so in earlier cultures commodities such</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.140" end="00:03:04.230" style="s2">as cattle stones or metals were used as</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:07.100" style="s2">money buyers took the value of the goods</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">on trust when making their purchase</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.100" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">today - money is a question of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:18.989" style="s2">confidence so the currency today isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.260" end="00:03:21.030" style="s2">money today we&#39;re using currency but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.989" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">only reason it has any purchasing power</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.030" end="00:03:26.459" style="s2">whatsoever is because yesterday your</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:28.890" style="s2">experience was that it purchased</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.459" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">something so you have faith that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.890" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">going to purchase something tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:36.989" style="s2">otherwise it has no value whatever form</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:40.650" style="s2">it takes reliable money has two</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.989" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">characteristics it is genuine and it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.650" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">stable people can rely on its value well</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">you know what fiat currency around the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:52.049" style="s2">planet has maintained its value they all</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:53.370" style="s2">fall in value so right away you can see</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.049" end="00:03:55.230" style="s2">the difference they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.370" end="00:03:58.620" style="s2">currency here and when they say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.230" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">genuine I mean what is genuine a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.620" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">counterfeit somebody that&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">their own printing press in their</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:06.660" style="s2">basement is making genuine notes as far</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.130" style="s2">as he&#39;s concerned that they&#39;re genuine</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.660" end="00:04:10.360" style="s2">counterfeit</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.130" end="00:04:12.370" style="s2">these things that just come off of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.360" end="00:04:14.800" style="s2">printing press well yeah it&#39;s a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.370" end="00:04:16.900" style="s2">line from a central bank or a government</p>

<p begin="00:04:16.900" end="00:04:21.100" style="s2">to store value for you because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.060" end="00:04:24.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t over long periods of time it</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.100" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">loses value Gold banknotes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.130" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">electronic money meaning electronic</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:33.550" style="s2">currency may be stored divided up or</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:34.990" style="s2">transported as it&#39;s material value has</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.550" end="00:04:39.400" style="s2">declined over time</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.990" end="00:04:42.430" style="s2">it&#39;s genuineness has had to be beyond</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.400" end="00:04:44.200" style="s2">question well this one says that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.430" end="00:04:47.770" style="s2">got to maintain its value and right here</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.200" end="00:04:50.440" style="s2">they&#39;re contradicting the next one the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.770" end="00:04:52.300" style="s2">one thing here gold is the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.440" end="00:04:56.290" style="s2">that they&#39;re talking about that has not</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.300" end="00:04:58.060" style="s2">lost its value in the past where goods</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.290" end="00:05:00.640" style="s2">were used as money today</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.060" end="00:05:04.330" style="s2">central banks must ensure that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.640" end="00:05:05.800" style="s2">supply of money is restricted well what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.330" end="00:05:07.720" style="s2">are they doing all over the planet today</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.800" end="00:05:09.640" style="s2">they&#39;re lifting all the restrictions on</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.640" end="00:05:13.720" style="s2">they&#39;re flooding the planet with</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.780" end="00:05:27.670" style="s2">none of them were actually money because</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.210" end="00:05:29.380" style="s2">they all had a weakness one or more</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.670" end="00:05:31.870" style="s2">properties of money that they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.380" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">fulfill therefore they are commodity</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.870" end="00:05:36.520" style="s2">currencies not money some of these were</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">widely used right up until the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.520" end="00:05:41.650" style="s2">of the 20th century and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:43.150" style="s2">stuff here that I haven&#39;t seen here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.650" end="00:05:47.590" style="s2">something very interesting</p>

<p begin="00:05:52.930" end="00:05:57.970" style="s2">has a certain fungibility to it each</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.150" end="00:06:00.100" style="s2">unit would have the same value and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.970" end="00:06:03.310" style="s2">can make change you can snap these</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.100" end="00:06:05.590" style="s2">things apart into units of six it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.310" end="00:06:07.480" style="s2">portable it&#39;s not that heavy this</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.590" end="00:06:09.670" style="s2">fulfils quite a few of the functions of</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.770" end="00:06:17.710" style="s2">well and now we come to the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.350" end="00:06:20.100" style="s2">real money here we have little pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.710" end="00:06:22.230" style="s2">metal just little pieces that have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.100" end="00:06:25.620" style="s2">Okin off of bars or something that was</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.330" end="00:06:31.590" style="s2">you know the head purchasing power they</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.010" end="00:06:33.110" style="s2">had an intrinsic value but they still</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.590" end="00:06:35.220" style="s2">weren&#39;t fungible which means</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.110" end="00:06:38.250" style="s2">interchangeable every one of them had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.220" end="00:06:40.770" style="s2">different value you can see that some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.250" end="00:06:43.230" style="s2">them have a higher silver content some</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.770" end="00:06:45.030" style="s2">of them have a higher gold content these</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.230" end="00:06:48.360" style="s2">are called electrum it&#39;s a mixture of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.030" end="00:06:49.770" style="s2">gold and silver naturally-occurring what</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.360" end="00:06:53.250" style="s2">you notice is that this is from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.770" end="00:06:55.140" style="s2">seventh century BC and then between the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.250" end="00:06:56.940" style="s2">7th and the 6th century we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.140" end="00:06:59.880" style="s2">about somewhere between six eighty and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.940" end="00:07:03.180" style="s2">630 D see the emergence of true money</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.880" end="00:07:06.150" style="s2">here we&#39;ve got four coins the large one</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.180" end="00:07:09.420" style="s2">is a one-third stater coin and the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.150" end="00:07:11.760" style="s2">three are one-sixth stater coins each</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.420" end="00:07:15.000" style="s2">unit is interchangeable you can get now</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.760" end="00:07:17.220" style="s2">a unit of account you can take so many</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.000" end="00:07:19.260" style="s2">of these in trade for so many of loaves</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.220" end="00:07:21.000" style="s2">of bread and you don&#39;t have to get break</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.260" end="00:07:23.640" style="s2">out your little scale and weigh them any</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.000" end="00:07:26.970" style="s2">longer with the little chunks of metal</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.640" end="00:07:28.470" style="s2">you had to weigh every transaction that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.970" end="00:07:30.180" style="s2">was going on you had to weigh whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.470" end="00:07:32.700" style="s2">your payment was and then take a guess</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.180" end="00:07:34.590" style="s2">as to what the purity was here you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.700" end="00:07:36.670" style="s2">some standards that were set by mints</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.590" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">and guaranteed by those mints</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.670" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">these are a unit of account they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:43.300" style="s2">fungible every one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:47.290" style="s2">interchangeable they&#39;re portable they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.300" end="00:07:50.680" style="s2">durable in your pocket over long periods</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.290" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">of time they&#39;re divisible you can make</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.680" end="00:07:56.500" style="s2">change you can see there&#39;s a 1/3 stator</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:59.230" style="s2">and 1/6 skaters and they&#39;re a store of</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.230" end="00:08:06.970" style="s2">still have purchasing power today 2600</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.700" end="00:08:09.030" style="s2">years after they were made another thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.970" end="00:08:14.350" style="s2">that I find really interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.030" end="00:08:17.920" style="s2">between maybe 680 BC and 300 BC cultures</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.350" end="00:08:20.530" style="s2">all around the world they all gravitated</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.920" end="00:08:23.740" style="s2">toward gold and silver coinage as money</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.530" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">the entire world sort of decided all</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.740" end="00:08:28.420" style="s2">together that gold and silver were money</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:30.250" style="s2">why because the free markets keep on</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.420" end="00:08:33.390" style="s2">selecting gold and silver as money</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.250" end="00:08:36.970" style="s2">because of the properties that it has</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.390" end="00:08:39.580" style="s2">so now we get to the room of real money</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.970" end="00:08:41.860" style="s2">this is a vault door and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.580" end="00:08:43.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve got all the great examples of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.860" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">the real gold and silver coins so come</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.840" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">on in and join me so here we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:54.490" style="s2">first this is gold and silver what</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">they&#39;re using to make money and here we</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.490" end="00:09:01.180" style="s2">have some very early representations of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.040" end="00:09:04.300" style="s2">gold and silver coins and I love these</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.180" end="00:09:06.220" style="s2">displays they start with coins and Lydia</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.300" end="00:09:09.580" style="s2">so these coins go back to the very first</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.220" end="00:09:12.310" style="s2">minting of true coinage so here we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.580" end="00:09:15.250" style="s2">the starting of the sixth century BC and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.310" end="00:09:18.730" style="s2">then it goes up to the third century and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.250" end="00:09:22.030" style="s2">then from the fifth to the 11th century</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.730" end="00:09:24.580" style="s2">and the 13th to the 15th century and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.030" end="00:09:27.730" style="s2">these displays just go on and on with</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.580" end="00:09:31.030" style="s2">the history of of real money gold and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.730" end="00:09:34.279" style="s2">silver here are 17th and 18th century</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.030" end="00:09:36.470" style="s2">here we come to the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.279" end="00:09:39.410" style="s2">and now we&#39;re all the way up to the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.470" end="00:09:42.079" style="s2">century here and here we come to our</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.410" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">first example of government-issued fiat</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.079" end="00:09:49.639" style="s2">currency this is from China this is from</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:52.850" style="s2">1375 and what&#39;s interesting is I have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.639" end="00:09:55.069" style="s2">chart that compares the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.850" end="00:09:57.259" style="s2">paper currency in China compared to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.069" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">silver and there was a hyperinflation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.259" end="00:10:01.879" style="s2">this currency it wasn&#39;t backed by</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.660" end="00:10:03.259" style="s2">anything it wasn&#39;t backed by taxes it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.879" end="00:10:05.809" style="s2">wasn&#39;t backed by anything in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.259" end="00:10:07.660" style="s2">Treasury they could just print this and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.809" end="00:10:09.980" style="s2">so this went into a hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.660" end="00:10:12.019" style="s2">because the government was just running</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.980" end="00:10:14.629" style="s2">its budget by just doing deficit</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.019" end="00:10:17.480" style="s2">spending by printing and then I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.629" end="00:10:19.610" style="s2">to skip to some of the colonial currency</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.480" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">this is the United States and each one</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.610" end="00:10:25.430" style="s2">of these currencies is printed by a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:28.579" style="s2">different state we&#39;ve got Maryland South</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.430" end="00:10:30.709" style="s2">Carolina North Carolina Connecticut New</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.579" end="00:10:33.079" style="s2">York this one here is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.709" end="00:10:37.430" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s printed in 14th year of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.079" end="00:10:42.170" style="s2">the reign of King George V 3rd it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.430" end="00:10:44.120" style="s2">dated March 25th 1776 so this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.170" end="00:10:44.809" style="s2">few months before the Declaration of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.120" end="00:10:49.220" style="s2">Independence</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.809" end="00:10:52.579" style="s2">it says his death to counterfeit but</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.220" end="00:10:54.680" style="s2">this was printed just before we started</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.579" end="00:10:57.110" style="s2">coming out with the Continental dollar</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.680" end="00:10:58.639" style="s2">which went into a hyperinflation because</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.110" end="00:11:04.370" style="s2">of pure deficit spending on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.639" end="00:11:07.189" style="s2">Revolutionary War and so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.370" end="00:11:10.100" style="s2">wall where real money gets corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.189" end="00:11:12.800" style="s2">this is where it all turns to paper</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.100" end="00:11:16.339" style="s2">which sometimes is backed by something</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.800" end="00:11:20.740" style="s2">but it can be a lie they can print more</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.339" end="00:11:20.740" style="s2">than they have of the stuff to back it</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.670" end="00:11:25.930" style="s2">as we learned in Episode two one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.550" end="00:11:28.090" style="s2">first things the country does at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.930" end="00:11:30.100" style="s2">outbreak of war is to suspend Redemption</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.100" end="00:11:34.960" style="s2">longer redeemable in gold this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.440" end="00:11:37.390" style="s2">exactly what Germany did before World</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.390" end="00:11:40.570" style="s2">suffered through one of the worst</p>

<p begin="00:11:44.680" end="00:11:48.090" style="s2">heavy penalties stifled the German</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.510" end="00:11:50.350" style="s2">economy and brought it to a standstill</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.090" end="00:11:52.450" style="s2">leaving the country with the same two</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.020" end="00:12:09.370" style="s2">since their currency was no longer tied</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.300" end="00:12:11.140" style="s2">to gold it was decided to light up the</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.140" end="00:12:15.070" style="s2">out paying the debts with new currency</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:18.550" style="s2">created out of thin air</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.070" end="00:12:20.590" style="s2">this had drastic consequences check out</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.170" end="00:12:51.940" style="s2">and this is an example of different</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.570" end="00:12:55.060" style="s2">currencies used during the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.940" end="00:12:58.210" style="s2">hyperinflation and they call some of it</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.210" end="00:13:04.600" style="s2">is interesting they figured the way out</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.520" end="00:13:07.060" style="s2">of hyperinflation was to print more so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.600" end="00:13:09.730" style="s2">in 1923 the value of money fell by 50%</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.060" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">or more per day so that means prices are</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.730" end="00:13:14.980" style="s2">doubling every day it&#39;s falling by 50%</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:17.650" style="s2">nearly everyone spent their money as</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.940" end="00:15:38.590" style="s2">used to be called the Reichstag and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:42.440" style="s2">felt it&#39;s very very significant in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.590" end="00:15:44.750" style="s2">out of monetary crisis you very often</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.440" end="00:15:47.810" style="s2">see the political landscape change</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.750" end="00:15:49.700" style="s2">dramatically it&#39;s the middle class of</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.700" end="00:15:55.720" style="s2">with their vote they&#39;re the largest</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.720" end="00:16:00.680" style="s2">currency crisis like a hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.820" end="00:16:03.980" style="s2">wipes out and impoverishes the middle</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.680" end="00:16:07.580" style="s2">class and they become filled with fear</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.980" end="00:16:10.730" style="s2">and it&#39;s very easy for somebody to come</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.580" end="00:16:14.750" style="s2">in and prey on that fear and dictators</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.730" end="00:16:17.060" style="s2">arise out of hyperinflation and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.750" end="00:16:19.910" style="s2">one of my greatest fears as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.060" end="00:16:22.940" style="s2">United States goes I think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.910" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">we all have to be very very careful and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.940" end="00:16:27.730" style="s2">very watchful for what happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:27.730" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.290" end="00:16:33.779" style="s2">a few years ago I was interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.269" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">congressman Ron Paul and he said I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.779" end="00:16:37.110" style="s2">that there&#39;s going to be a financial</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.480" style="s2">collapse before they come around to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.110" end="00:16:42.570" style="s2">thinking seriously about monetary policy</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.480" end="00:16:45.870" style="s2">but the real thing we have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.570" end="00:16:48.120" style="s2">about is not the loss of our well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.870" end="00:16:50.730" style="s2">the rise of a dictator it&#39;s the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.120" end="00:16:53.220" style="s2">our freedom and what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.730" end="00:16:55.110" style="s2">the rise of Hitler there were two times</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.220" end="00:16:57.029" style="s2">where he played on the public sphere he</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.110" end="00:16:59.750" style="s2">could never have come to power had there</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.029" end="00:17:02.220" style="s2">not been a hyperinflation back in 1923</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.750" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">just one week before the end of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.220" end="00:17:07.260" style="s2">hyperinflation that&#39;s when Hitler made</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:10.140" style="s2">his first big public appearance playing</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.260" end="00:17:12.270" style="s2">to the public fear Hitler and his</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.140" end="00:17:14.309" style="s2">stormtroopers took over a beer hall</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.270" end="00:17:17.400" style="s2">called the Burger brow Keller seats</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.309" end="00:17:19.709" style="s2">around 3,000 people and he took the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.400" end="00:17:22.230" style="s2">stage by gunpoint into this literally</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.709" end="00:17:24.600" style="s2">captive audience he gave the speech that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.230" end="00:17:26.819" style="s2">would change the world because of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.600" end="00:17:29.220" style="s2">hyperinflation the audience had been</p>

<p begin="00:17:29.220" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">been stolen by the government running</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:36.390" style="s2">the printing presses and so they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:38.580" style="s2">scared he offers them a scapegoat and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.390" end="00:17:40.530" style="s2">tells them he&#39;s got the way out he</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.580" end="00:17:43.140" style="s2">became very popular after that and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.530" end="00:17:44.640" style="s2">very next day the people that were</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.140" end="00:17:46.110" style="s2">listening to him followed him in an</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:49.169" style="s2">attempt to overthrow the government</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.110" end="00:17:52.230" style="s2">he was arrested tried and convicted of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.169" end="00:17:54.090" style="s2">high treason and served time while he</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.230" end="00:17:56.970" style="s2">was in jail he was provided with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.090" end="00:17:58.890" style="s2">private secretary Rudolf Hess and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.970" end="00:18:01.350" style="s2">actually wrote about half of mine comp</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.890" end="00:18:04.409" style="s2">while he was serving time but once the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.350" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">economy started to recover Hitler lost</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.409" end="00:18:08.549" style="s2">that leverage that power he could no</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:11.090" style="s2">longer play on the fear of the public</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.549" end="00:18:14.159" style="s2">once the economic situation had changed</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.090" end="00:18:16.200" style="s2">by the middle of the Roaring Twenties he</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.159" end="00:18:18.659" style="s2">had become a joke the Nazi Party had</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.200" end="00:18:20.250" style="s2">gone to less than 2% of the vote then</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.659" end="00:18:22.890" style="s2">along came the Great Depression and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.250" end="00:18:24.690" style="s2">Hitler seized this opportunity again</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.890" end="00:18:26.850" style="s2">he was the first politician to actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.690" end="00:18:29.250" style="s2">campaign by aircraft hitting multiple</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.850" end="00:18:31.320" style="s2">cities in a single day and the Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.250" end="00:18:33.450" style="s2">Party went from 2% of the vote to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.320" end="00:18:36.390" style="s2">second largest party in Germany so</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.450" end="00:18:38.830" style="s2">playing on the public sphere Hitler was</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.390" end="00:18:41.140" style="s2">able to take away the rights of German</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.830" end="00:18:42.820" style="s2">he was able to all these guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.140" end="00:18:44.649" style="s2">rights in the Bymark Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.820" end="00:18:47.649" style="s2">private property rights the right to</p>

<p begin="00:18:52.120" end="00:18:57.070" style="s2">he just took away all of their rights</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.309" end="00:18:58.690" style="s2">and seized power so these are the some</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.070" end="00:19:00.929" style="s2">some of the things that we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.690" end="00:19:03.909" style="s2">concerned about and be very mindful of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.929" end="00:19:09.789" style="s2">economic crisis very often leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.909" end="00:19:12.460" style="s2">rise of the dictators yeah the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.789" end="00:19:14.289" style="s2">this was just 70 to 80 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.460" end="00:19:17.350" style="s2">basically there are still people alive</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.289" end="00:19:19.779" style="s2">today that experienced this but enough</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.350" end="00:19:23.049" style="s2">of them have died off to where the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.779" end="00:19:25.179" style="s2">warnings fall on deaf ears Berlin is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.049" end="00:19:27.070" style="s2">great example of another massive danger</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.179" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">to individual freedom that economic</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.070" end="00:19:32.470" style="s2">crisis can bring the swing from</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.029" end="00:19:42.820" style="s2">East Communist Germany was reunified in</p>

<p begin="00:19:42.820" end="00:19:46.419" style="s2">separation showed the vastly different</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.230" end="00:19:59.320" style="s2">interesting is how quickly an economy</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.630" end="00:20:00.639" style="s2">can heal just twenty years ago you would</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.320" end="00:20:02.889" style="s2">have seen a tremendous difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.639" end="00:20:06.309" style="s2">between the East and the West you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.889" end="00:20:08.919" style="s2">one side that has tall buildings and is</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.309" end="00:20:10.840" style="s2">much more industrialized and new and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.919" end="00:20:14.350" style="s2">then one side that was that&#39;s very old</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.840" end="00:20:18.460" style="s2">and gray it was one of the best examples</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.350" end="00:20:20.529" style="s2">of what a state-run society does to an</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.460" end="00:20:22.630" style="s2">economy how the more the public relies</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.230" end="00:22:19.740" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all these Holograms and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.700" end="00:22:21.900" style="s2">watermarks and different threads and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.740" end="00:22:23.850" style="s2">different types of paper and then here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.460" end="00:22:44.180" style="s2">expanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.710" end="00:22:49.580" style="s2">so we learned an episode for the modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.239" end="00:22:50.749" style="s2">currency creation is a complete scam but</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.580" end="00:22:52.759" style="s2">a whole lot of people had trouble</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.749" end="00:22:54.649" style="s2">believing that it could be true the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.759" end="00:22:57.529" style="s2">European Central Bank has this awesome</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.649" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">display that shows you exactly how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.529" end="00:23:02.539" style="s2">done and it&#39;s basically the same as our</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:07.279" style="s2">episode four so here&#39;s a quick recap</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.539" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">thanks to the ECB basically the central</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.279" end="00:23:14.090" style="s2">bank and the treasury swap io u--&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:16.820" style="s2">bank rate the central bank writes a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.090" end="00:23:19.850" style="s2">check and the Treasury issues a Treasury</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.820" end="00:23:23.119" style="s2">bond which is an IOU and that creates</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.850" end="00:23:25.429" style="s2">currency and then it gets somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.119" end="00:23:27.830" style="s2">paid it gets deposited into a bank</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.429" end="00:23:30.259" style="s2">account and a thousand marks</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.830" end="00:23:32.299" style="s2">they would hold 10% so right here</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.259" end="00:23:34.879" style="s2">they&#39;re already telling you that his</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.299" end="00:23:37.730" style="s2">bank account is a lie he put a deposit</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.879" end="00:23:39.590" style="s2">of 200 it deposited a thousand in it</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.730" end="00:23:43.159" style="s2">they only withhold 100 in case he wants</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.590" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">some of that and then they loan out 900</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.159" end="00:23:48.200" style="s2">which then they she buys something from</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:51.409" style="s2">this guy he deposits the 900 they</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.200" end="00:23:54.019" style="s2">borrowed 90% of that and leave just 10%</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.409" end="00:23:56.779" style="s2">on deposit for him and the result is</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.019" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">that it expands every thousand ends up</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.779" end="00:24:02.570" style="s2">creating 10,000 for every $1 creates $10</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.559" end="00:24:05.509" style="s2">it you know they&#39;ve got the results here</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.570" end="00:24:09.169" style="s2">it&#39;s all sort of a voodoo hocus-pocus of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.509" end="00:24:10.609" style="s2">scheme one of the great things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.169" end="00:24:12.440" style="s2">noticed here is that throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.609" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">museum they keep on proving the point</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.440" end="00:24:18.499" style="s2">that even though this is the Bundesbank</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:20.269" style="s2">museum they prove the point that fiat</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.499" end="00:24:23.149" style="s2">currencies that come off of a printing</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.269" end="00:24:26.299" style="s2">press eventually go to zero that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.149" end="00:24:29.480" style="s2">really worthless this says the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.299" end="00:24:31.850" style="s2">goal of all monetary systems was to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.480" end="00:24:35.269" style="s2">ensure that money is trustworthy and</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.309" end="00:24:48.409" style="s2">revolution in the 19th century the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.649" end="00:24:51.559" style="s2">rapidly growing economy needed a means</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.409" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">of payment which could adapt flexibly to</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:57.590" style="s2">Loney you can have a fixed currency</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.550" end="00:24:59.750" style="s2">supply and when you have economic growth</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.590" end="00:25:02.890" style="s2">it means that the currency gains in</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.760" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">with economic growth yeah right so here</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">we&#39;ve got my buddy Milton actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:31.910" style="s2">Milton was sort of a semi free-market</p>
