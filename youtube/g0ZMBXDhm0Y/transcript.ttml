<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.720" style="s2">hello this is Eric I wanted to give a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.070" end="00:00:05.549" style="s2">small note to say how today&#39;s episode</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.720" end="00:00:07.770" style="s2">fits into the general arc of the portal</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.549" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">as many of you know I&#39;m a critic about</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.770" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">what is going on in academics and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:12.929" style="s2">science and in the economy with respect</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:15.030" style="s2">to innovation I feel that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.929" end="00:00:18.060" style="s2">experiencing some kind of a very broad</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.030" end="00:00:19.800" style="s2">malaise and slowdown on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.060" end="00:00:22.350" style="s2">whenever you allege that something is</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.800" end="00:00:24.359" style="s2">going generally environmentally wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.350" end="00:00:25.650" style="s2">is incumbent upon you to check that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.359" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">aren&#39;t in fact in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.650" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">depressive or negative episode one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:30.960" style="s2">the things that I like to do is to check</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:33.180" style="s2">and see where are the bright spots what</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.960" end="00:00:34.710" style="s2">are the things that inspire me where do</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.180" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">I see people actually pushing the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:39.090" style="s2">envelope making breakthroughs if I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:41.610" style="s2">spot those then I can realize that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.090" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">not me who&#39;s dead but in fact a memory</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.610" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">of what is possible that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">causing the frustration and in these</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:50.789" style="s2">circumstances I sometimes look very far</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">afield to see where people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">innovating and one of the places that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:57.090" style="s2">see a tremendous amount of innovation</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.910" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">right now is surfing at some point out</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.090" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">of the corner of my eye</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">one particular surfer caught my</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:04.439" style="s2">attention his name was Kyle ne and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:07.560" style="s2">wasn&#39;t as clear as it is now that he was</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.439" end="00:01:09.450" style="s2">on to something really special as his</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.560" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">skill has increased he&#39;s been taking on</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.450" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">larger and larger waves and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">how to say this exactly but playing with</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">them so before you watch today&#39;s episode</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.659" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">put in the name Kyle ne ka i le and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">why and maybe words like jaws or Nazare</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:29.250" style="s2">and watch what he&#39;s doing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:31.350" style="s2">unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen every</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">time I look at it it looks more like art</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.350" end="00:01:35.400" style="s2">than surfing he&#39;s effectively playing</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">with some of the most frightening and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.400" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">dangerous waves in the world and in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">sense it seems like a metaphor for where</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">we are that with many forces that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">potentially incredibly threatening a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">small number of us have the courage and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:50.790" style="s2">strength and discipline to instead of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">fretting and becoming innervated we</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.790" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">start playing with what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:55.530" style="s2">possibilities might be kai is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:58.140" style="s2">experimenting in every technological</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.530" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">dimension every athletic dimension and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.140" end="00:02:03.270" style="s2">dare say every artistic dimension that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">you can imagine his famous phrase is I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">feel like we&#39;re just getting started</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to believe that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">that much Headroom given how close to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">the edge it seems that he&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">playing but even though I know that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:15.240" style="s2">taking his life</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:17.430" style="s2">making these videos for us and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.240" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">experiencing these waves in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.430" end="00:02:21.510" style="s2">perfect solitude that must accompany</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:23.100" style="s2">being inside a gigantic barrel or</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.510" end="00:02:26.310" style="s2">falling down the face of what can only</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.100" end="00:02:28.350" style="s2">be called a liquid cliff I know that guy</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.310" end="00:02:29.940" style="s2">is actually serving something greater in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.350" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">the human spirit and even though we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.940" end="00:02:33.630" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily be in the wave with</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">him through the magic of helicopters or</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.630" end="00:02:37.530" style="s2">GoPro videos or any of the incredible</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:39.390" style="s2">technologies that we&#39;re now able to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.530" end="00:02:41.580" style="s2">to bring the experience closer to home</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.390" end="00:02:43.320" style="s2">kai is reacquainting ourselves with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.580" end="00:02:46.200" style="s2">sense of the possible what might lie</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.320" end="00:02:48.360" style="s2">within us both as individuals and as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.200" end="00:02:49.890" style="s2">society so I hope you&#39;ll see this in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.360" end="00:02:51.420" style="s2">this light I hope you&#39;ll take an</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.890" end="00:02:53.550" style="s2">interest in surfing whether you live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.420" end="00:02:56.730" style="s2">a landlocked country or whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.550" end="00:02:59.610" style="s2">old and maybe even disabled what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.730" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">doing is in fact to me hugely inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.610" end="00:03:02.550" style="s2">and one of the places that I turned to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:05.430" style="s2">when I start to feel extremely</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.550" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">frustrated so I feel hugely honored to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.430" end="00:03:08.790" style="s2">be able to bring you Kai Lenny please</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:11.310" style="s2">take a look at his videos beforehand and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.790" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">then once you&#39;ve understood what it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.310" end="00:03:14.880" style="s2">that we are all capable of through his</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:15.960" style="s2">efforts and antics I think you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.880" end="00:03:17.700" style="s2">that this interview is much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.960" end="00:03:26.550" style="s2">enjoyable I hope you enjoy it as much as</p>

<p begin="00:04:20.370" end="00:04:24.090" style="s2">just a quick background for everyone you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.410" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">came and visited on Maui and you saw my</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.090" end="00:04:29.220" style="s2">board room and you saw all this equip</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:31.890" style="s2">and stuff where I grew up it&#39;s just down</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.220" end="00:04:35.640" style="s2">the road from we what would I would call</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.140" end="00:04:47.190" style="s2">break it almost sends this signal out to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.420" end="00:04:50.070" style="s2">the rest of the world and people come</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.190" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">from all corners of life to either surf</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.670" end="00:06:03.630" style="s2">the internet and stuff but it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.070" end="00:06:05.550" style="s2">scene over there and Hawaii is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.630" end="00:06:07.890" style="s2">powerful place as well like an energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.550" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">you can really feel that and it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.890" end="00:06:11.850" style="s2">unexplainable there&#39;s a frequency that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:13.290" style="s2">if you can match it it will give you</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.850" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">some of the most incredible moments your</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">when when I start talking about like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.700" end="00:06:21.750" style="s2">art of actually riding big waves yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.560" end="00:06:23.820" style="s2">and being in tune with the ocean and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.750" end="00:06:26.360" style="s2">frequency and I mean why not just stop</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.820" end="00:06:28.140" style="s2">start talking about it now is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.360" end="00:06:29.760" style="s2">no offense I&#39;m going to start off by</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.140" end="00:06:31.440" style="s2">just contradicting you you say that if</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.760" end="00:06:32.010" style="s2">you are out there of course you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.440" end="00:06:34.440" style="s2">ride it</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.010" end="00:06:36.330" style="s2">you&#39;re too modest because I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.440" end="00:06:39.070" style="s2">people who are living out there who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.330" end="00:06:41.710" style="s2">surfers who love it and when I tie a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.070" end="00:06:44.530" style="s2">go and reserve this particular wave the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.710" end="00:06:46.660" style="s2">usual answer is how did I&#39;m not crazy I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.530" end="00:06:50.410" style="s2">mean this wave went when it when it</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.660" end="00:06:53.500" style="s2">breaks is really it&#39;s a beast it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.410" end="00:06:56.710" style="s2">beast but okay so you throw it back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.500" end="00:06:58.510" style="s2">when I was gosh my I think one of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.710" end="00:07:00.340" style="s2">earliest memories is a child you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.510" end="00:07:01.630" style="s2">all of a sudden it&#39;s like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.340" end="00:07:03.310" style="s2">remember anything and then maybe when</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.630" end="00:07:04.720" style="s2">you&#39;re four years old or even younger</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.310" end="00:07:06.850" style="s2">like three years old all sudden there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.720" end="00:07:09.180" style="s2">like a distinct memory one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.850" end="00:07:11.790" style="s2">distinct memories I have as a kid is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.180" end="00:07:15.640" style="s2">standing on the cliff watching jaws</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.790" end="00:07:19.110" style="s2">break so there was already a seed plants</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.640" end="00:07:23.800" style="s2">from an early age highly you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.110" end="00:07:25.660" style="s2">curious kid super my superheroes the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.800" end="00:07:29.590" style="s2">guy&#39;s the equivalent of the Justice</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.660" end="00:07:31.480" style="s2">League and the Avengers were called the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.590" end="00:07:35.070" style="s2">strapped crew and they were the ones</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.480" end="00:07:38.020" style="s2">that pioneered pay off EI ka jaws and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.070" end="00:07:41.140" style="s2">jaws doing a name check them huh</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.020" end="00:07:43.450" style="s2">yeah yeah no absolutely so who who made</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.140" end="00:07:46.120" style="s2">up this strapped crew were guys that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.450" end="00:07:49.450" style="s2">invented tow-in surfing which was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.120" end="00:07:51.430" style="s2">first the first or still probably the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.450" end="00:07:53.530" style="s2">best way to ride big waves on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.430" end="00:07:55.930" style="s2">high-performance level</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.530" end="00:07:56.710" style="s2">Laird Hamilton people have probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.930" end="00:08:00.760" style="s2">heard of him</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.710" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">Dave Kalama was another rush Randall</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.330" end="00:08:12.490" style="s2">comprise this strap crew and there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.180" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">all different characters a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.490" end="00:08:19.240" style="s2">windsurfing champions a lot of them from</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:22.180" style="s2">different parts of the island islands</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.240" end="00:08:25.590" style="s2">you know from Oahu as well as now of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.180" end="00:08:28.390" style="s2">course but they kind of were on Maui</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.590" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">Gerry Lopez who&#39;s like I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.390" end="00:08:32.650" style="s2">equivalent of Yoda in surfing you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:36.940" style="s2">like he&#39;s the all-wise basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.650" end="00:08:40.120" style="s2">all-knowing like master the the the guru</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.940" end="00:08:41.770" style="s2">he showed Laird this wave back in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.120" end="00:08:45.340" style="s2">day like this is in the he&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.770" end="00:08:50.260" style="s2">watching it since the early 80s and very</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.340" end="00:08:52.120" style="s2">early 90s they Jerry&#39;s like okay like he</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.260" end="00:08:52.750" style="s2">noticed Laird was really taking interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.120" end="00:08:54.730" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.750" end="00:08:56.410" style="s2">big wave surfing on Oahu which at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.730" end="00:08:58.330" style="s2">time was considered the best big waves</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.410" end="00:08:59.830" style="s2">on the planet he&#39;s like I got something</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.330" end="00:09:01.870" style="s2">you might want to see and they walk</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.830" end="00:09:03.400" style="s2">through the pineapple fields they get to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.870" end="00:09:06.790" style="s2">the edge of the cliff and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.400" end="00:09:10.210" style="s2">sudden Laird is shown the the Golden</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.790" end="00:09:12.430" style="s2">Goose the the the best big wave on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.210" end="00:09:14.290" style="s2">planet it&#39;s so perfect that if he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.430" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">someone on it for scale it looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.290" end="00:09:20.110" style="s2">small wave it&#39;s rare to find big waves</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:23.650" style="s2">that look six feet but are really 60</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.110" end="00:09:25.390" style="s2">feet and so Jerry told me when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.650" end="00:09:28.450" style="s2">kid and I always try to get him to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.390" end="00:09:29.980" style="s2">repeat it is a story of like in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.450" end="00:09:32.380" style="s2">when a giant swell came and they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.980" end="00:09:33.610" style="s2">surfing this other break which is also</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.380" end="00:09:35.860" style="s2">known as one of the best waves in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.610" end="00:09:39.010" style="s2">planet not best big wave but best wave</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.860" end="00:09:40.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s very similar to how jaws breaks</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.010" end="00:09:43.840" style="s2">just on a smaller scale</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.540" end="00:09:47.860" style="s2">it&#39;s called Honolua Bay beautiful epic</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.840" end="00:09:49.810" style="s2">sunsets there and he said one day after</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.860" end="00:09:52.570" style="s2">surfing they went up to jaws to go check</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.810" end="00:09:54.310" style="s2">it and it was so big that where we surf</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.570" end="00:09:56.200" style="s2">for now would have been whitewater and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.310" end="00:09:58.089" style="s2">where the boats are would have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.200" end="00:10:00.010" style="s2">where the barrel was so where the wave</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.089" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">was breaking and creating a giant tube</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.010" end="00:10:03.490" style="s2">he he would he would approximately the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:06.460" style="s2">waves were probably in the 100 foot</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.490" end="00:10:08.410" style="s2">range and there was other nicknames or</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.460" end="00:10:10.810" style="s2">other names they called it before it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.410" end="00:10:12.370" style="s2">coined Jaws jaws sort of came when Laird</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.810" end="00:10:15.160" style="s2">landed on the cover of National</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.370" end="00:10:16.740" style="s2">Geographic with a giant wave and he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.160" end="00:10:18.940" style="s2">just in board shorts and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.740" end="00:10:20.650" style="s2">unbelievable shot which I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.940" end="00:10:22.270" style="s2">still the only surfer to ever be on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.650" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">cover of National Geographic well</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.270" end="00:10:26.020" style="s2">there&#39;s so many ways that I want to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:28.830" style="s2">in underneath the story before I even</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.020" end="00:10:31.000" style="s2">get to like you and what what a jerk so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.830" end="00:10:32.589" style="s2">but I don&#39;t even know where to begin so</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.000" end="00:10:34.630" style="s2">first of all one the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.589" end="00:10:36.790" style="s2">connects us really is that we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.630" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">fascinated by waves I&#39;m fascinated in</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.790" end="00:10:41.890" style="s2">physics you&#39;re fascinated by ocean waves</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:44.830" style="s2">yeah and one of the things that I find</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.890" end="00:10:47.970" style="s2">fascinating is that these these waves</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.830" end="00:10:50.410" style="s2">have are sort of like intercontinental</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.970" end="00:10:52.870" style="s2">intercontinental exploration that has</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.410" end="00:10:55.150" style="s2">only happened recently like we mapped</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.870" end="00:10:59.650" style="s2">all the landmasses but somehow they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.150" end="00:11:01.030" style="s2">still relatively recently only</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.650" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">relatively recently have there been</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.030" end="00:11:05.780" style="s2">certain discoveries of these really</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:08.390" style="s2">important surfable waves like Mavericks</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.780" end="00:11:11.510" style="s2">in Half Moon Bay has not been explored</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.390" end="00:11:13.550" style="s2">for that long and then yeah and then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.510" end="00:11:16.100" style="s2">know you&#39;re saying with with jaws jaws</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.550" end="00:11:17.990" style="s2">and P ie the thing that I find</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.100" end="00:11:21.500" style="s2">fascinating about this is that there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.990" end="00:11:23.870" style="s2">also this taboo around tow-in surfing</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.500" end="00:11:26.420" style="s2">that because of the the purity of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.870" end="00:11:28.310" style="s2">surfing culture and the ethos of it like</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.420" end="00:11:29.990" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about it both as a sport</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.310" end="00:11:33.020" style="s2">and the beauty of the wave and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.990" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">sunsets like it is the sort of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.020" end="00:11:38.780" style="s2">complete picture in world and there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:42.530" style="s2">something transgressive about towing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.780" end="00:11:45.140" style="s2">is that right I think before anybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.530" end="00:11:48.530" style="s2">started kind of pinning toe and surfing</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.140" end="00:11:51.670" style="s2">as being unnatural or not so full or</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.530" end="00:11:53.960" style="s2">whatever other kind of term they use</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.670" end="00:11:56.390" style="s2">people were just blown away by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.960" end="00:11:58.580" style="s2">that you could ride away that big and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.390" end="00:12:01.970" style="s2">it didn&#39;t even matter at that point now</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.580" end="00:12:04.010" style="s2">fast forward to present day people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.970" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">paddling in and tow and surfing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.010" end="00:12:11.110" style="s2">widely regarded within course surfers as</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:14.030" style="s2">cheating but I think they forget that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.110" end="00:12:15.589" style="s2">it&#39;s the it would be the equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.030" end="00:12:18.140" style="s2">going and climbing the mountain and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.589" end="00:12:20.839" style="s2">skiing down versus taking the helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.140" end="00:12:22.580" style="s2">up and doing it 50 times but isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.839" end="00:12:24.710" style="s2">an issue about how fast the wave is</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.580" end="00:12:26.270" style="s2">moving if it&#39;s moving too quickly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.710" end="00:12:28.730" style="s2">almost impossible to pedal it or is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.270" end="00:12:30.080" style="s2">changed I think it&#39;s changed a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.730" end="00:12:32.330" style="s2">mean I think what people thought was</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.080" end="00:12:35.030" style="s2">impossible to paddle into is possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.330" end="00:12:36.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just the best way I can describe it</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.030" end="00:12:38.780" style="s2">is when you&#39;re trying to paddle into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.680" end="00:12:41.180" style="s2">really big wave just imagine there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.780" end="00:12:42.770" style="s2">platform or like a launching pad right</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.180" end="00:12:44.750" style="s2">that you can go from but the bigger the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.770" end="00:12:47.930" style="s2">wave gets the smaller that launching pad</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.750" end="00:12:50.030" style="s2">gets where you can take off and make it</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.930" end="00:12:52.070" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s all about positioning</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.030" end="00:12:55.400" style="s2">it&#39;s triangulating yourself with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.070" end="00:12:57.290" style="s2">land around you so looking at shore and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.400" end="00:12:58.940" style="s2">finding two trees or two points that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.290" end="00:13:01.190" style="s2">line up with okay this is where I am on</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.940" end="00:13:03.800" style="s2">part of the reef and then looking to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.190" end="00:13:05.780" style="s2">your left and finding another point and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.800" end="00:13:07.610" style="s2">lining up at the point and so you kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.780" end="00:13:10.250" style="s2">of triangulate yourself in and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.610" end="00:13:12.110" style="s2">where you buy by checking where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.250" end="00:13:13.520" style="s2">waves are breaking that&#39;s how you figure</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.110" end="00:13:15.230" style="s2">out that you&#39;re gonna be in the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.520" end="00:13:17.000" style="s2">spot to get on that launching pad</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.230" end="00:13:19.350" style="s2">because if you&#39;re too much on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.000" end="00:13:21.300" style="s2">shoulder which is kind of away from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.350" end="00:13:22.650" style="s2">part of the way you&#39;re not gonna catch</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.300" end="00:13:24.360" style="s2">it if you&#39;re too deep you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.650" end="00:13:29.100" style="s2">become part of the waving go over the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.360" end="00:13:31.110" style="s2">falls so it&#39;s that&#39;s pattern given that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.100" end="00:13:32.790" style="s2">this is a non surfing program can we say</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.110" end="00:13:35.190" style="s2">that over the falls means getting swept</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.790" end="00:13:37.290" style="s2">up over the crest and being just yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.190" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">guess over the falls would be the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.290" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">equivalent of jumping into the water and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:44.250" style="s2">going over Niagara right like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:47.880" style="s2">same thing like oh so you become the lip</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.250" end="00:13:53.340" style="s2">the wave picks you up in what we call it</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.880" end="00:13:56.340" style="s2">as the ride after the ride okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.340" end="00:13:59.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t really want to object in any way</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.340" end="00:14:00.930" style="s2">to toen I don&#39;t have these issues so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.130" end="00:14:02.730" style="s2">the main issue for me is innovation</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.930" end="00:14:06.950" style="s2">right like the reason that I find this</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.730" end="00:14:09.690" style="s2">so fascinating is that I wasn&#39;t around</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.950" end="00:14:13.500" style="s2">unconscious like in 68 I was three years</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.690" end="00:14:15.870" style="s2">old when dick Fosbury came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.500" end="00:14:19.020" style="s2">Fosbury flop and changed high jumping</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.870" end="00:14:21.720" style="s2">and if you think back to like table</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.020" end="00:14:24.990" style="s2">tennis this guy from Japan I think his</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.720" end="00:14:27.960" style="s2">name is like Hiroshi Ishii such put</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.990" end="00:14:29.970" style="s2">rubber on a hard bat paddle and changed</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.960" end="00:14:32.820" style="s2">the game of table tennis forever what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.970" end="00:14:34.920" style="s2">see you is doing and I could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.820" end="00:14:36.630" style="s2">about this I&#39;ve been looking at you for</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.920" end="00:14:38.730" style="s2">several years not knowing because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.630" end="00:14:41.070" style="s2">not a surfing guy why am i carrying</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.730" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">about this one guy and it wasn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.070" end="00:14:47.100" style="s2">so evident or earlier than it as it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:49.350" style="s2">now that suddenly I&#39;m seeing things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.100" end="00:14:51.810" style="s2">I just came and believe I&#39;m watching and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.350" end="00:14:53.160" style="s2">essentially what I think I&#39;m seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.810" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">that you&#39;re taking some of the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.160" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">largest waves and instead of just like</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:02.010" style="s2">showing that they can be ridden like</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:06.660" style="s2">actually just playing and doing tricks</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.010" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">and pushing every available corner of</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.660" end="00:15:11.310" style="s2">performance to eek out things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:13.320" style="s2">nobody knew was were possible so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.310" end="00:15:15.870" style="s2">really inventing your own vocabulary of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.320" end="00:15:18.840" style="s2">surfing to me and then the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.870" end="00:15:22.650" style="s2">that you said that just you know tore at</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.840" end="00:15:25.640" style="s2">my soul I was watching you on some kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.650" end="00:15:27.720" style="s2">of unbelievable wave doing some trick</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.640" end="00:15:29.130" style="s2">and you said you know the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.720" end="00:15:31.710" style="s2">blows my mind is I feel like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.130" end="00:15:33.310" style="s2">getting started and I thought I thought</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.710" end="00:15:35.379" style="s2">we were already at the limits</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.310" end="00:15:37.509" style="s2">of what is doable and your point of view</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.379" end="00:15:40.089" style="s2">was I can see how much Headroom I have</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.509" end="00:15:42.550" style="s2">and its enormous its yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.089" end="00:15:44.379" style="s2">crazy the there&#39;s I think there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.550" end="00:15:46.180" style="s2">room for growth than high performance</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.379" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">big wave riding than there is in any</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.180" end="00:15:53.499" style="s2">part of surfing maybe even any part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:55.990" style="s2">action sports because you know I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.499" end="00:15:58.779" style="s2">starting now to do 360s on big waves and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.990" end="00:16:01.240" style="s2">do it confidently but there&#39;s really no</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.779" end="00:16:03.550" style="s2">reason why I shouldn&#39;t be doing a triple</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.240" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">cork something that Shaun White can do</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.550" end="00:16:07.050" style="s2">you know in a halfpipe you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:10.180" style="s2">something like that so your feet are</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.050" end="00:16:11.949" style="s2">tethered to your board are they on toe</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.180" end="00:16:13.689" style="s2">and surfing it is on totally it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.949" end="00:16:15.069" style="s2">the only way to do it in big waves tone</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.689" end="00:16:17.139" style="s2">surfing because of the speeds you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.069" end="00:16:20.290" style="s2">reaching the amount of winds even on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.139" end="00:16:22.089" style="s2">glassy day when there&#39;s no winds on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.290" end="00:16:23.499" style="s2">face of the wave waves are moving fast</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.089" end="00:16:26.819" style="s2">enough they&#39;re producing their own local</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.499" end="00:16:30.339" style="s2">winds at the top so you know probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.819" end="00:16:33.069" style="s2">20-knot winds 25 mile an hour winds on</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.339" end="00:16:35.110" style="s2">the top of these breaking waves and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.069" end="00:16:36.819" style="s2">you and the boards are heavy to go</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.110" end="00:16:39.009" style="s2">through all that chalk because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.819" end="00:16:41.740" style="s2">probably hitting 55 miles an hour at</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.009" end="00:16:44.680" style="s2">times and even faster potentially in</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.740" end="00:16:47.860" style="s2">certain waves riding my toe and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.680" end="00:16:51.850" style="s2">surfboard got it so what I want to sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.860" end="00:16:55.180" style="s2">of just induce people to do is to Google</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.850" end="00:16:58.180" style="s2">and search for some of the epic rides</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.180" end="00:17:00.370" style="s2">that you&#39;ve taken that also alerted the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.180" end="00:17:01.990" style="s2">world to the fact that something crazy</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.370" end="00:17:06.100" style="s2">was going on so you know with Laird</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.990" end="00:17:08.919" style="s2">Hamilton a very famous alert that went</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.100" end="00:17:11.980" style="s2">after the plan it was this photograph of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.919" end="00:17:14.260" style="s2">him in Tahiti which must have been Lenny</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.980" end="00:17:18.309" style="s2">emwave did you want to talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.260" end="00:17:20.470" style="s2">that affected you I mean Laird was my it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.309" end="00:17:23.770" style="s2">was a superhero to me even up to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.470" end="00:17:26.980" style="s2">point and this is 2000 and Laird was</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.770" end="00:17:28.840" style="s2">known is known as writing and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.980" end="00:17:30.940" style="s2">like pushing the limits a big wave</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.840" end="00:17:33.880" style="s2">riding where people didn&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.940" end="00:17:35.649" style="s2">could go part I think that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.880" end="00:17:38.380" style="s2">kind of inspired to follow in those</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.649" end="00:17:41.470" style="s2">footsteps like and it might be a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.380" end="00:17:43.630" style="s2">different approach but for Laird when he</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.470" end="00:17:45.549" style="s2">rode that wave in 2000 he just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.630" end="00:17:46.650" style="s2">like blew the door open on what was</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.549" end="00:17:48.960" style="s2">possible so</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.650" end="00:17:50.970" style="s2">what wave was it talked is this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.960" end="00:17:54.120" style="s2">Tahiti yeah so this is in Tahiti</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.970" end="00:17:55.920" style="s2">French Polynesia most beautiful day ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.120" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">there&#39;s this way of called Taihu po</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.920" end="00:18:01.110" style="s2">people call it Teahupoo people call it</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:02.910" style="s2">chops and it&#39;s this wave that breaks in</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.110" end="00:18:06.390" style="s2">six feet of water on a shallow reef</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.910" end="00:18:08.190" style="s2">comes from the depths of the ocean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.390" end="00:18:10.410" style="s2">really deep on the other side and what</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.190" end="00:18:12.270" style="s2">makes this wave so unique is it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.410" end="00:18:16.110" style="s2">displace the entire ocean instead of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.270" end="00:18:18.030" style="s2">being instead of standing up vertically</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.110" end="00:18:20.220" style="s2">it just folds over so it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.030" end="00:18:22.890" style="s2">it&#39;s the closest thing to a rideable</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.220" end="00:18:24.390" style="s2">tsunami there is because there&#39;s no back</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.890" end="00:18:27.210" style="s2">to the wave it&#39;s just the whole ocean</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.390" end="00:18:29.670" style="s2">view it is the most beautifully perfect</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.210" end="00:18:32.130" style="s2">wave I&#39;ve ever seen and and I&#39;m there</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.670" end="00:18:34.680" style="s2">are two waves that have captivated me</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.130" end="00:18:37.140" style="s2">just visually and they&#39;re the exact</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.680" end="00:18:39.210" style="s2">opposite of each other so this in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.140" end="00:18:40.920" style="s2">how should I say should I ask a Teahupoo</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.210" end="00:18:42.330" style="s2">well you could say it however you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.920" end="00:18:44.550" style="s2">what does it mean can you translate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.330" end="00:18:48.230" style="s2">got a good name oh yeah this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.550" end="00:18:51.270" style="s2">great so Tia hoop oh yeah Teahupoo is</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:52.890" style="s2">translates to broken skulls yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.270" end="00:18:56.580" style="s2">it&#39;s not because of the wave but that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.890" end="00:18:58.530" style="s2">area is like culturally significant they</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.580" end="00:19:00.930" style="s2">call it the end of the road just where</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.530" end="00:19:03.480" style="s2">the road ends and that&#39;s where that wave</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.930" end="00:19:05.820" style="s2">is right at the end but back in the day</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.480" end="00:19:09.240" style="s2">there used to be really big battles in</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.820" end="00:19:11.550" style="s2">Tahiti listen and people&#39;s skulls were</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.240" end="00:19:13.950" style="s2">put on stakes and they would be stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.550" end="00:19:15.540" style="s2">the sand there and it just kind of fit</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.950" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">perfect that one of the gnarliest waves</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.540" end="00:19:21.690" style="s2">I could stick you on a stake is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:24.900" style="s2">maybe 200 300 yards offshore a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.690" end="00:19:26.580" style="s2">shallow reef so shallow so sharp razors</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.900" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">just imagine razor blades on the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.580" end="00:19:32.070" style="s2">you touch it fairly it&#39;s just you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:35.580" style="s2">get ripped apart and a classic Tahitian</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.070" end="00:19:37.290" style="s2">tradition is you lime them after to kill</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.580" end="00:19:38.790" style="s2">any bacteria because the reefs are so</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.290" end="00:19:41.580" style="s2">alive there that it&#39;s really easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.790" end="00:19:44.340" style="s2">staph infection yes and so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.580" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">using anything that&#39;s like by modern</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.340" end="00:19:50.910" style="s2">medicine standards or less painful they</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:52.860" style="s2">lime you and it is or it&#39;s like putting</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.910" end="00:19:57.150" style="s2">acid in your wounds it hurts so bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.860" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">because you know the acidic the nature</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.150" end="00:20:00.450" style="s2">of limes are pretty acidic and so it</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:01.560" style="s2">just feels it&#39;s kill</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.450" end="00:20:03.720" style="s2">everything in there but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.560" end="00:20:05.340" style="s2">stinging horribly bad and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.720" end="00:20:07.650" style="s2">nothing worse when you get cut you try</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.340" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">to hide it from like all your friends</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.650" end="00:20:12.330" style="s2">and the local Tahitians because they</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:14.040" style="s2">seem like lime and people it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.330" end="00:20:16.770" style="s2">hilarious find so much pleasure in</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.040" end="00:20:18.840" style="s2">seeing you just like squirm as they like</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.770" end="00:20:21.780" style="s2">lime you&#39;re back and it&#39;s good because</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.840" end="00:20:23.940" style="s2">it kills ya any staff that could</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.780" end="00:20:25.530" style="s2">possibly take you but at the very same</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.940" end="00:20:26.760" style="s2">time it&#39;s miserable you already go</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.530" end="00:20:29.310" style="s2">through a horrible experience I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.760" end="00:20:31.380" style="s2">you have to do it again this this wave</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.310" end="00:20:32.700" style="s2">is not the tallest but it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.380" end="00:20:34.500" style="s2">heaviest waves in the world interested</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.700" end="00:20:38.010" style="s2">in terms of the mass of water yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.500" end="00:20:39.870" style="s2">mean it kind of defies like belief when</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:42.270" style="s2">people first see it especially in person</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.870" end="00:20:44.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not that the wave it actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.270" end="00:20:46.260" style="s2">not like the wave gets displaced as it</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.280" end="00:20:48.750" style="s2">comes in and hits the reef and typically</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.260" end="00:20:51.180" style="s2">what happens is water is shot vertically</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.750" end="00:20:53.430" style="s2">in rows what creates a tall wave there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.180" end="00:20:55.410" style="s2">a back to the wave it&#39;s usually half the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.430" end="00:20:57.090" style="s2">size of the front of the wave but</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.410" end="00:21:00.870" style="s2">because there&#39;s all that mass pushing</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.090" end="00:21:02.970" style="s2">behind it but at Teahupoo the way it</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.870" end="00:21:04.980" style="s2">hits the reef it just shoots the lip</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.970" end="00:21:07.770" style="s2">forward and the whole oceans behind it</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.980" end="00:21:09.510" style="s2">and it draws all the water off the reef</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.770" end="00:21:11.820" style="s2">back into the ocean and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.510" end="00:21:13.710" style="s2">surfing at below sea level if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.820" end="00:21:15.720" style="s2">riding a 30-foot wave there you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.710" end="00:21:18.060" style="s2">thirty feet below sea level you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.720" end="00:21:19.860" style="s2">like a pit and you can see the water</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.060" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">going back up the reef in front it it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.860" end="00:21:23.640" style="s2">almost doesn&#39;t make sense yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:25.770" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s a freak of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.640" end="00:21:29.010" style="s2">certain waves do that but this one&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.770" end="00:21:30.810" style="s2">king of it it&#39;s the best it&#39;s I like to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.010" end="00:21:32.580" style="s2">call it the most perfect close out on</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.810" end="00:21:34.050" style="s2">the planet because and all the photos</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.580" end="00:21:36.900" style="s2">you see of it it looks like this perfect</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.050" end="00:21:38.460" style="s2">wave and it is for a little bit but as</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.900" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">you&#39;re riding there&#39;s a right-hander</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.460" end="00:21:42.390" style="s2">that&#39;s coming actually so there&#39;s a wave</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:45.330" style="s2">that&#39;s equal in size that&#39;s gonna close</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.390" end="00:21:47.310" style="s2">out all that missed the right at the end</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.330" end="00:21:49.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s called spit you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.310" end="00:21:51.030" style="s2">see a breaking wave as it barrels it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.320" end="00:21:53.400" style="s2">shoot like a cannon and all the water</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.030" end="00:21:55.980" style="s2">it&#39;s the compression of water these big</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.400" end="00:21:59.370" style="s2">waves waves in general are like cannons</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.980" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">or like guns so when you&#39;re riding in</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.370" end="00:22:04.140" style="s2">the tube you can feel air it&#39;s a vortex</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:07.710" style="s2">right it&#39;s a vortex and so it&#39;s sucking</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.140" end="00:22:09.930" style="s2">air in like a jet engine like and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.710" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">the wave there&#39;s so much water moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.930" end="00:22:12.840" style="s2">the air can&#39;t escape so it goes the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:14.730" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.840" end="00:22:18.390" style="s2">resistance which is back out the tube</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.730" end="00:22:20.460" style="s2">and it explodes and it shoots chunks of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.390" end="00:22:23.220" style="s2">water that can knock you off your board</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.460" end="00:22:25.890" style="s2">probably hundreds of pounds of like</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.220" end="00:22:28.740" style="s2">water that are like shooting you and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.890" end="00:22:30.990" style="s2">hurts really bad like it feels certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.740" end="00:22:32.669" style="s2">waves it feels so good like getting just</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.990" end="00:22:34.620" style="s2">it&#39;s the only time it feels good to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.669" end="00:22:36.570" style="s2">spat on man well you said this thing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.620" end="00:22:38.130" style="s2">me about barrels that I never thought of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.570" end="00:22:39.750" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s a common place and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.130" end="00:22:43.340" style="s2">surfing but I&#39;d never heard it which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.750" end="00:22:47.610" style="s2">that a barrel is a unique experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.340" end="00:22:51.960" style="s2">because of you said something about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.610" end="00:22:55.470" style="s2">only time that yeah well riding inside a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.960" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">tube a barrel a wave basically the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.470" end="00:22:59.250" style="s2">hollow part of the wave as it pitches</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:01.260" style="s2">over it&#39;s unique because it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.250" end="00:23:03.690" style="s2">way we can breathe underwater without</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.260" end="00:23:06.450" style="s2">any other breathing apparatus so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.690" end="00:23:08.610" style="s2">was amazing and you feel like a fish for</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.450" end="00:23:11.970" style="s2">a second you know and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.610" end="00:23:15.659" style="s2">about waves that break and the negative</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.970" end="00:23:17.730" style="s2">ions they produce that you know make you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.659" end="00:23:20.659" style="s2">feel so good so you can imagine being in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.730" end="00:23:23.370" style="s2">this kind of capsule or this vortex</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.659" end="00:23:26.360" style="s2">you&#39;re so focused on making it it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:29.070" style="s2">that&#39;s on the front of your mind that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.360" end="00:23:31.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a moment when nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.070" end="00:23:33.450" style="s2">exists and time slows down it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.710" end="00:23:35.730" style="s2">really are almost I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.450" end="00:23:37.950" style="s2">accessing more parts of your brain or</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.730" end="00:23:40.649" style="s2">what it is but what feels like tense</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.950" end="00:23:42.120" style="s2">what is 4 seconds feels like a minute</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.649" end="00:23:44.100" style="s2">that&#39;s amazing and you&#39;re just in there</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.120" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">and and I&#39;m watching water droplets move</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.100" end="00:23:49.470" style="s2">by me at like matrix speed everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.710" end="00:23:51.870" style="s2">looks like the matrix and if you really</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.470" end="00:23:53.460" style="s2">calm and and you&#39;re really comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.870" end="00:23:55.409" style="s2">you can look you have time to like look</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:23:57.659" style="s2">around and absorb all this information</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.409" end="00:23:58.799" style="s2">and then all of a sudden as it spits and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.659" end="00:24:00.779" style="s2">you come out of the tube it&#39;s like life</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.799" end="00:24:03.270" style="s2">just starts going back to normal speed</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.779" end="00:24:06.090" style="s2">and you realize how life fast life moves</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.270" end="00:24:08.330" style="s2">because in there it&#39;s like you have all</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.090" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">the time in the world it feels like and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.330" end="00:24:12.890" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s what it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:15.899" style="s2">pinnacle of what you could do surfing</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.890" end="00:24:18.179" style="s2">better than any maneuver any aerial</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.899" end="00:24:21.539" style="s2">acrobatics trick so being in the tube</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.179" end="00:24:23.669" style="s2">well so that tube I just I geek out on</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.539" end="00:24:25.500" style="s2">it because it&#39;s such an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.669" end="00:24:26.220" style="s2">unbelievable I can&#39;t even imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.500" end="00:24:28.110" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.220" end="00:24:30.539" style="s2">beautiful and perfect exists the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.110" end="00:24:32.850" style="s2">version of beauty that I&#39;m drawn to is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.539" end="00:24:34.380" style="s2">this other totally different wave which</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.850" end="00:24:37.049" style="s2">I think you said you may be headed</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.380" end="00:24:42.230" style="s2">towards which is the shipsterns bluff in</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.049" end="00:24:45.990" style="s2">Tasmania which is the gnarliest ugliest</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.230" end="00:24:48.179" style="s2">it&#39;s waves within waves and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.990" end="00:24:50.309" style="s2">quantum field theory is this concept</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.179" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">beyond quantum mechanics it&#39;s waves upon</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.309" end="00:24:54.659" style="s2">waves or and so there&#39;s waves within</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:57.659" style="s2">waves concept even though it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.659" end="00:24:59.700" style="s2">obviously classical is really evocative</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.659" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">to me and there&#39;s this thing inside of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.700" end="00:25:04.530" style="s2">this crazy Tasmanian thing which people</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:06.659" style="s2">which forms like a Ledge and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.530" end="00:25:08.760" style="s2">watched people fall off of it a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.659" end="00:25:09.929" style="s2">yeah you want to use it as a jump oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.760" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.929" end="00:25:13.380" style="s2">well you know what&#39;s interesting there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:15.270" style="s2">not that many crazy big waves in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.380" end="00:25:16.830" style="s2">world they&#39;re big waves but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.270" end="00:25:18.870" style="s2">waves that are in the league of their</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.830" end="00:25:19.860" style="s2">own you could say chop who&#39;s in a league</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.870" end="00:25:23.130" style="s2">of its own</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.860" end="00:25:25.559" style="s2">jaws Nazare mavericks which is here in</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.130" end="00:25:26.690" style="s2">california and chip Stearns is one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.559" end="00:25:29.159" style="s2">them as well and they all have different</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.690" end="00:25:30.360" style="s2">personalities and the art of riding</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.159" end="00:25:32.909" style="s2">these big waves is finding their</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.360" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">personality and kind of matching your</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.909" end="00:25:37.409" style="s2">the best of you with them but what makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:38.730" style="s2">shipsterns exciting and the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.409" end="00:25:40.679" style="s2">that college shipsterns is because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.730" end="00:25:42.659" style="s2">way the cliff is situated it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.679" end="00:25:44.789" style="s2">the front of a massive ship maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.659" end="00:25:46.919" style="s2">high tannic or something there no but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.789" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">know all about that way you know because</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.919" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve been studying it kind of getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:53.429" style="s2">ready to go and I&#39;ve had opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">ago and it hasn&#39;t worked out I mean big</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.429" end="00:25:57.150" style="s2">wave surfing you could be halfway across</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:26:00.120" style="s2">the world on your way and the forecast</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.150" end="00:26:01.140" style="s2">can switch in a flash and you turn</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.120" end="00:26:02.520" style="s2">around and go home because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.140" end="00:26:04.409" style="s2">going even breaking or the winds are</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.520" end="00:26:06.510" style="s2">gonna be bad and Tasmania is very</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.409" end="00:26:09.090" style="s2">susceptible to bad weather just cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.510" end="00:26:10.679" style="s2">really as close to Antarctica as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.090" end="00:26:13.169" style="s2">yet and all those massive storms that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.679" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">produces big waves oftentimes slam that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.169" end="00:26:18.659" style="s2">Island and but what makes that wave so</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:21.419" style="s2">raw and so heavy is well it is really</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.659" end="00:26:24.179" style="s2">cold water but it&#39;s the the bathymetry</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.419" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">the bottom the the what we would call</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.179" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">the reef which is really just rocks</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:30.690" style="s2">there has a bunch of it&#39;s an uneven</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.590" end="00:26:34.470" style="s2">surface and so a bit mapped</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.690" end="00:26:36.659" style="s2">no but I just know from experience and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.470" end="00:26:39.149" style="s2">mean if you you can look into videos</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.659" end="00:26:39.900" style="s2">about they they basically talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.149" end="00:26:41.910" style="s2">about all these</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.900" end="00:26:45.630" style="s2">because I got thinkin Teahupoo I&#39;ve I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.910" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">saw underwater photography of the wave</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.630" end="00:26:49.800" style="s2">breaking from below and it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.000" end="00:26:51.750" style="s2">most confusing and gorgeous things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.800" end="00:26:54.450" style="s2">ever seen it&#39;s pretty I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.750" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">always like hidden features to reefs or</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.450" end="00:26:59.850" style="s2">to the bottom contours that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:01.950" style="s2">necessarily realize but for the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.850" end="00:27:04.470" style="s2">part if you&#39;ve been surfing a long time</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.950" end="00:27:07.170" style="s2">and especially big waves certain things</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.470" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">equal other things so so you could infer</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.170" end="00:27:10.980" style="s2">what the bottom must look like from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:14.150" style="s2">gnarly aspect of that fish yeah just by</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.980" end="00:27:16.710" style="s2">seeing those ledges you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.150" end="00:27:19.080" style="s2">ledges within the face so this wave the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.710" end="00:27:21.630" style="s2">way it breaks is it&#39;s like a right hand</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.080" end="00:27:23.940" style="s2">or Teahupoo but maybe not quite as</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.630" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">displacing of the ocean but it has all</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.940" end="00:27:28.500" style="s2">these like steps they call them ya face</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:30.060" style="s2">the wave so miniature waves within later</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.500" end="00:27:32.520" style="s2">you could have like four miniature waves</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.060" end="00:27:34.680" style="s2">in the face and that is like if you go</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.520" end="00:27:36.810" style="s2">to a river and you look at a river in</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.680" end="00:27:38.400" style="s2">and you see a little standing wave right</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.810" end="00:27:40.710" style="s2">before you&#39;ll see some turbulence right</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.400" end="00:27:42.870" style="s2">before that&#39;s because there&#39;s lightly</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.710" end="00:27:45.450" style="s2">uneven rocks right before it and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.870" end="00:27:47.580" style="s2">underwater there&#39;s these rocks that come</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.450" end="00:27:50.070" style="s2">up that kind of ever so slightly</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.580" end="00:27:53.280" style="s2">displaced the wave in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.070" end="00:27:55.470" style="s2">makes these mini waves in between but</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.280" end="00:27:57.210" style="s2">everyone the way people typically ride</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.470" end="00:27:58.380" style="s2">it is they kind of those are speed bumps</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.210" end="00:28:00.180" style="s2">and they try to get through that as</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.380" end="00:28:03.030" style="s2">quick as they can to get into the barrel</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.180" end="00:28:04.920" style="s2">and I&#39;d say my vision for it and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.030" end="00:28:06.600" style="s2">scary one anything you try and new in</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.920" end="00:28:08.970" style="s2">big waves is horrifying because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.600" end="00:28:11.850" style="s2">like the consequences are severe</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.970" end="00:28:14.730" style="s2">beatdowns and you know possibly drowning</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.850" end="00:28:16.500" style="s2">but is hitting these small little waves</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.730" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">and doing aerial maneuvers off of them</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.500" end="00:28:20.100" style="s2">and then dude as soon as you land have</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.720" end="00:28:22.020" style="s2">the whole wave break over you and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.100" end="00:28:23.970" style="s2">in the tube and then come out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.020" end="00:28:25.590" style="s2">really like being a drug addict and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.970" end="00:28:28.110" style="s2">just need a harder drug or something</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.590" end="00:28:29.670" style="s2">because you can ride big waves all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.110" end="00:28:31.620" style="s2">time you can surf in general all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.670" end="00:28:34.890" style="s2">time but for me I feel like I need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.620" end="00:28:36.780" style="s2">constantly be upping it because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.890" end="00:28:38.910" style="s2">as satisfying as the last time I did it</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.780" end="00:28:40.830" style="s2">and also I&#39;m all about progression as</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.910" end="00:28:42.300" style="s2">well like I love getting the the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.830" end="00:28:44.460" style="s2">of getting better and maybe that go</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.300" end="00:28:45.210" style="s2">coincides with it right never done drugs</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.460" end="00:28:48.390" style="s2">in my life</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.210" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">but I can imagine what it might yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.390" end="00:28:51.430" style="s2">you have yes yeah it is a drug but a</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:53.620" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.430" end="00:28:56.230" style="s2">right what is the this is the thing when</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.620" end="00:28:59.080" style="s2">I look at I mean it and again I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.230" end="00:29:03.640" style="s2">view you within surfing I view you as</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.080" end="00:29:05.650" style="s2">like rodney mullen or eddie van halen or</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.640" end="00:29:09.970" style="s2">Alex Honnold like they&#39;re just these</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.650" end="00:29:13.180" style="s2">people who are meant to change what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.970" end="00:29:15.040" style="s2">know about each of these sports now</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.180" end="00:29:16.360" style="s2">they&#39;re all within a context you have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.040" end="00:29:18.400" style="s2">lot of colleagues or you&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.360" end="00:29:19.830" style="s2">from and you&#39;re teaching but I do see</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.400" end="00:29:23.590" style="s2">you as what do you see is</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.830" end="00:29:25.420" style="s2">differentiating your approach that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.590" end="00:29:26.680" style="s2">know if everybody&#39;s got kind of a secret</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.420" end="00:29:28.630" style="s2">signature and you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.680" end="00:29:31.150" style="s2">your own expression relative to the wave</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.630" end="00:29:33.400" style="s2">what would you say is defining the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.150" end="00:29:35.110" style="s2">difference what am i picking up I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.400" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">know anything about surfing at all well</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.110" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">I think from my own personal perspective</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:44.170" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">other people that do really cool things</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.170" end="00:29:48.070" style="s2">like I think I&#39;ve heard Alex Honnold</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:50.560" style="s2">talk about this as well it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.070" end="00:29:51.970" style="s2">don&#39;t really know any better it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.560" end="00:29:54.340" style="s2">kind of who you are and it kind of sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.970" end="00:29:57.610" style="s2">of happens and it&#39;s and in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.340" end="00:29:59.260" style="s2">perspective it is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.610" end="00:30:01.300" style="s2">environment that you spent the most time</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.260" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">in or that experience that led to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.300" end="00:30:05.080" style="s2">point and so when I go out on the water</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:08.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going out there with</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.080" end="00:30:12.100" style="s2">the intention to change things or try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.730" end="00:30:13.900" style="s2">recreate the landscape it&#39;s more like oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.100" end="00:30:15.790" style="s2">son I got this idea and that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.900" end="00:30:17.110" style="s2">really fun and I think I could do it you</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.790" end="00:30:19.180" style="s2">know it&#39;s like it starts with a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.110" end="00:30:20.830" style="s2">whisper in your head like maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.180" end="00:30:22.060" style="s2">possible then you do it and then all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.830" end="00:30:24.970" style="s2">a sudden you look around and people</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.060" end="00:30:28.090" style="s2">appreciate it and without people</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.970" end="00:30:29.980" style="s2">appreciating it I don&#39;t think I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.090" end="00:30:31.930" style="s2">know if it was significant you need the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.980" end="00:30:33.790" style="s2">feedback loop look I think Rodney Boland</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.930" end="00:30:34.450" style="s2">was basically having a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.790" end="00:30:36.790" style="s2">himself</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.790" end="00:30:41.560" style="s2">but sometimes like when you&#39;re surfing a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.100" end="00:30:43.540" style="s2">big wave you don&#39;t know how big the wave</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.560" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">is behind you for example if I never saw</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.540" end="00:30:47.980" style="s2">a photo or if no one told me if it was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:49.570" style="s2">gnarly I might get so used to it yeah</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.940" end="00:30:57.460" style="s2">starting to get desensitized by certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.310" end="00:30:59.800" style="s2">size waves now I mean I spent out of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.460" end="00:31:01.420" style="s2">last two weeks all terrifying yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.800" end="00:31:03.580" style="s2">but you get comfortable you know you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.420" end="00:31:06.070" style="s2">spend so much time in it spent the last</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.580" end="00:31:08.680" style="s2">eight days surfing big way</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.070" end="00:31:10.450" style="s2">out of two weeks and I was in Nazeri and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.680" end="00:31:12.370" style="s2">I went to jaws and foon Ezra is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.450" end="00:31:15.340" style="s2">Portuguese wave that comes out of an</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.340" end="00:31:20.410" style="s2">energy is being focused it may be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.860" end="00:31:22.840" style="s2">tallest close to the tallest surfable</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.410" end="00:31:24.760" style="s2">wave in the world yeah that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.840" end="00:31:27.400" style="s2">probably the most consistent big wave</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.760" end="00:31:30.700" style="s2">and I think we should that&#39;s an in-depth</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.400" end="00:31:33.040" style="s2">conversation that place but real quick</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.700" end="00:31:35.140" style="s2">I&#39;m just to kind of finish off this</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.040" end="00:31:36.550" style="s2">starting to read this no no but to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.140" end="00:31:39.280" style="s2">finish off sort of this kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.550" end="00:31:41.530" style="s2">on becoming desensitized a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.280" end="00:31:42.820" style="s2">and talking about like yeah how you kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.530" end="00:31:45.040" style="s2">of need feedback there was this one</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.820" end="00:31:46.660" style="s2">particular wave I&#39;m not meaning to toot</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.040" end="00:31:49.750" style="s2">my horn at all but there was this one</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.660" end="00:31:51.310" style="s2">particular wave where I got interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.750" end="00:31:53.800" style="s2">feedback from my brother afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.310" end="00:31:55.030" style="s2">where the way I was approaching it and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.800" end="00:31:56.590" style="s2">you might have seen it on my social</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.030" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">media on my Instagram it was that really</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.590" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">big barrel is wearing an orange vest and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:01.780" style="s2">I wrote it for a long time and I end up</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:04.450" style="s2">getting spit out was probably one of my</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.780" end="00:32:06.850" style="s2">best big-wave arrows ever but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.450" end="00:32:09.040" style="s2">interesting about that is I was I was so</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.850" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">focused on reading the curve of the wave</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.040" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">and when you&#39;re taking off on a wave at</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:16.690" style="s2">jaws the whole thing is a horseshoe it</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:18.550" style="s2">bends around you and taking in certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.690" end="00:32:19.960" style="s2">aspects of it I could read what its</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.550" end="00:32:22.150" style="s2">gonna do it&#39;s like predicting the future</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.960" end="00:32:23.980" style="s2">like if it hits the reef just in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.150" end="00:32:26.230" style="s2">way the waves gonna bear really hard I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.980" end="00:32:28.840" style="s2">gonna be standing in a cave or standing</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.230" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">in like a huge tunnel and without</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.840" end="00:32:32.290" style="s2">thinking twice or how big it was I just</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.640" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">bought um turned I did what we call a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.290" end="00:32:36.820" style="s2">check turn so it&#39;s a turn mid-face to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.770" style="s2">burn my speed off the tow board and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.820" end="00:32:41.140" style="s2">I just stood there and I lived inside</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.770" end="00:32:42.970" style="s2">this tube for a couple seconds but</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.140" end="00:32:45.430" style="s2">afterwards I was talking to my brother</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.970" end="00:32:46.900" style="s2">and he was like he&#39;s like how was that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.430" end="00:32:48.340" style="s2">barrel earlier you know he jumped off</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.900" end="00:32:49.510" style="s2">the cliff and I picked him up on the jet</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.340" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">ski and I was getting him some waves and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.510" end="00:32:54.160" style="s2">he was like he&#39;s like how do you stall</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:58.240" style="s2">for that and and and like do that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.160" end="00:32:59.710" style="s2">I&#39;m like honestly like no big like it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.240" end="00:33:01.650" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel that big he&#39;s like that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.710" end="00:33:04.180" style="s2">the biggest wave of the day so far and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.650" end="00:33:05.770" style="s2">and I was like that&#39;s really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.180" end="00:33:08.200" style="s2">weird I think I&#39;m like getting a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.770" end="00:33:10.630" style="s2">desensitized by what I&#39;m seeing because</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.200" end="00:33:12.310" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming such an often occurrence</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.630" end="00:33:14.650" style="s2">that it&#39;s becoming my normal all of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.310" end="00:33:16.330" style="s2">sudden and yeah it&#39;s still terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.650" end="00:33:18.520" style="s2">surfing big waves at all is terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.330" end="00:33:20.770" style="s2">just like a huge drop on</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.520" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">I think was on jaws that like the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.770" end="00:33:25.450" style="s2">was buzzing about yeah yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:27.220" style="s2">like last year and can you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.450" end="00:33:28.840" style="s2">that and is that an example of something</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.220" end="00:33:30.130" style="s2">where you didn&#39;t realize just how gnarly</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.840" end="00:33:33.520" style="s2">it was until you looked at the footage</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.130" end="00:33:35.830" style="s2">yeah absolutely so I had been riding</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.520" end="00:33:38.440" style="s2">there we had a big wave competition and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.830" end="00:33:40.780" style="s2">it got too big for paddling surfing so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.440" end="00:33:43.930" style="s2">the waves were in the 60 to 70 80 foot</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.780" end="00:33:46.270" style="s2">range and I decided to go tone surfing</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.930" end="00:33:47.560" style="s2">because what they called this off yes so</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.270" end="00:33:49.140" style="s2">we were in the middle of this contest</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.560" end="00:33:51.370" style="s2">and the waves just got too big and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.140" end="00:33:54.400" style="s2">probably getting too big was also the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.370" end="00:33:56.860" style="s2">wind factor it got really windy and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.400" end="00:33:59.020" style="s2">wind was blowing up the face making it</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.860" end="00:34:00.250" style="s2">really difficult to catch the wave</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.020" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">because it was just trying to blow you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.250" end="00:34:04.600" style="s2">out the back and if your surfboard turns</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.100" style="s2">into an air force it becomes a wing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.600" end="00:34:08.080" style="s2">and you start flying through the air and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.100" end="00:34:08.919" style="s2">to do that in competition I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.080" end="00:34:11.290" style="s2">just really dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.919" end="00:34:14.290" style="s2">I mean that morning the heat before they</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.290" end="00:34:15.880" style="s2">canceled it guys were passing out</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.290" end="00:34:17.740" style="s2">underwater hitting the water so hard</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.880" end="00:34:18.190" style="s2">having concussions they were blacking</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.740" end="00:34:20.230" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.190" end="00:34:22.419" style="s2">people were coming up spitting blood out</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.230" end="00:34:24.700" style="s2">of their lungs maybe one person in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.419" end="00:34:26.530" style="s2">final heat made a wave and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.700" end="00:34:28.780" style="s2">the decision came okay it&#39;s like too</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.530" end="00:34:30.730" style="s2">gnarly like we&#39;re all for big waves</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.780" end="00:34:32.890" style="s2">surfing and big wave competition but in</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.730" end="00:34:34.780" style="s2">a contest is never worth losing</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.890" end="00:34:36.640" style="s2">someone&#39;s life over anything you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.780" end="00:34:39.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not like big wave surfers get paid</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.640" end="00:34:42.610" style="s2">that much either to compete right um and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.700" end="00:34:45.610" style="s2">so they ended up canceling it it was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.610" end="00:34:46.810" style="s2">group decision from most of the surfers</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.610" end="00:34:48.850" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t want to continue</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.810" end="00:34:51.490" style="s2">because for fear of someone not coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.850" end="00:34:53.890" style="s2">home to their family and but on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.490" end="00:34:55.899" style="s2">other hand a total moron might think</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.890" end="00:34:57.790" style="s2">cool there&#39;s no one in the water I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.899" end="00:34:59.410" style="s2">gonna go for it I guess I&#39;m that moron</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.790" end="00:35:01.990" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.410" end="00:35:04.330" style="s2">what happens next well so I mean I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.990" end="00:35:06.490" style="s2">saw the stuff and I flipped out the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.330" end="00:35:10.450" style="s2">gauge is insane well so I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.490" end="00:35:12.220" style="s2">paddle anymore and with tow and surfing</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.450" end="00:35:13.660" style="s2">which is when it explains people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.220" end="00:35:17.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know a tonne surfing is it&#39;s a jet</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.660" end="00:35:19.270" style="s2">ski with a wakeboard rope on the back of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.560" end="00:35:20.670" style="s2">it and you use it to get towed into</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.270" end="00:35:23.020" style="s2">these massive waves so you eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.670" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">paddling altogether and it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.020" end="00:35:25.750" style="s2">slingshot into these giant waves and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:27.400" style="s2">you&#39;re riding a board that&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.750" end="00:35:31.240" style="s2">smaller versus a 10 foot board right</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.400" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">you&#39;re on a six foot board and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.240" end="00:35:34.690" style="s2">just ended up having the bet</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:36.550" style="s2">session in my life at that point because</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.690" end="00:35:38.050" style="s2">there was no one around everyone didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.550" end="00:35:41.350" style="s2">want to surf because they didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.050" end="00:35:42.850" style="s2">in jet injured because the contest was</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.350" end="00:35:45.610" style="s2">gonna run the next day the ways would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.850" end="00:35:47.290" style="s2">smaller but for me big wave surfing was</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.610" end="00:35:49.600" style="s2">never about competing it was always a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.290" end="00:35:52.210" style="s2">spiritual aspect that&#39;s where I found my</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.600" end="00:35:54.250" style="s2">it was almost became my religion because</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.210" end="00:35:55.960" style="s2">when you look at a big wave it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.250" end="00:35:58.180" style="s2">looking in a mirror in that moment is</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.960" end="00:36:00.220" style="s2">the most transcendent thing I think this</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.180" end="00:36:02.950" style="s2">goes into the name you can find out on</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.220" end="00:36:04.600" style="s2">Kai show right yeah yeah yeah so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.950" end="00:36:06.160" style="s2">they made videos and they called it the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.600" end="00:36:08.140" style="s2">Kai show because I was the only one out</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:11.530" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s it you can you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.140" end="00:36:14.200" style="s2">can search on it from that yeah and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.530" end="00:36:17.650" style="s2">I got out of it was was transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.200" end="00:36:19.240" style="s2">like there&#39;s this one man in this very</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.650" end="00:36:20.740" style="s2">vulnerable position you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.240" end="00:36:22.300" style="s2">know much about surfing you know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.740" end="00:36:26.470" style="s2">kind of risks you&#39;re taking out there</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.300" end="00:36:28.300" style="s2">yeah well so it stems from passion first</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.470" end="00:36:30.250" style="s2">and then it stems from a lot of hard</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.300" end="00:36:33.010" style="s2">work and focus and determination and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.250" end="00:36:35.110" style="s2">over not overcoming fear but being kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.010" end="00:36:36.550" style="s2">of in line with it as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.110" end="00:36:38.470" style="s2">eliminate fear that&#39;s when you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.550" end="00:36:41.710" style="s2">injured especially in big waves because</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.470" end="00:36:44.770" style="s2">you make brass brash decision so you are</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.710" end="00:36:46.270" style="s2">in essence to me a risk manager like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.770" end="00:36:47.140" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be here to be having this</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.270" end="00:36:49.360" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.140" end="00:36:51.160" style="s2">if you weren&#39;t playing the same role</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.360" end="00:36:53.050" style="s2">that like if you were running a hedge</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.160" end="00:36:54.820" style="s2">fund you have to figure out what can I</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.050" end="00:36:57.460" style="s2">afford to take what can I afford to take</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.820" end="00:36:59.320" style="s2">calculate the calculation and so that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.460" end="00:37:01.300" style="s2">all look at this stuff I mean and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.320" end="00:37:03.100" style="s2">also there&#39;s like a very weird aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.300" end="00:37:06.520" style="s2">the psychology I mean I don&#39;t know it in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.100" end="00:37:10.200" style="s2">surfing buddy know it in other places on</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.520" end="00:37:13.210" style="s2">the one hand it&#39;s like a very alpha male</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.200" end="00:37:15.280" style="s2">dominant sort of activity looking but on</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.210" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">the other side of that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:20.680" style="s2">submit to the wave like it is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.640" end="00:37:23.320" style="s2">gonna win it isn&#39;t wave it&#39;s an act of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.680" end="00:37:25.120" style="s2">submission right in my SEP tense and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.320" end="00:37:26.050" style="s2">acceptance because once you&#39;ve committed</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.120" end="00:37:28.660" style="s2">to that thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.050" end="00:37:30.670" style="s2">your choices disappear to an extent you</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.660" end="00:37:33.010" style="s2">have a limited amount that you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.670" end="00:37:34.900" style="s2">can&#39;t say too big for me once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.010" end="00:37:37.540" style="s2">already committed you&#39;re in oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.900" end="00:37:40.150" style="s2">know like I mean what I love most about</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.540" end="00:37:42.580" style="s2">big wave surfing in the draw is you look</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.150" end="00:37:44.980" style="s2">at a big wave and it&#39;s a mirror and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.580" end="00:37:45.600" style="s2">realize who you like there&#39;s no hiding</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.980" end="00:37:48.180" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.600" end="00:37:50.340" style="s2">lying to yourself who you are in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.180" end="00:37:53.790" style="s2">moment in your life is right in front of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.340" end="00:37:55.260" style="s2">you and you know it clear as day and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.790" end="00:37:57.690" style="s2">can either work on it or you can be</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.260" end="00:38:00.600" style="s2">stoked that you know of who you are in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.690" end="00:38:02.580" style="s2">that moment because it&#39;s it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.600" end="00:38:07.410" style="s2">you&#39;re facing death straight in the face</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.580" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">and fear has never been more relevant or</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.410" end="00:38:12.900" style="s2">more powerful in that moment and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:15.870" style="s2">there&#39;s something so satisfying and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.900" end="00:38:17.580" style="s2">scary though of accepting acceptance of</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.870" end="00:38:19.530" style="s2">fear it&#39;s like a release it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.580" end="00:38:21.150" style="s2">relief you kick out of a big wave and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.530" end="00:38:23.010" style="s2">you were just on that the edge of your</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.150" end="00:38:24.660" style="s2">life and if you fell you were just</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.010" end="00:38:26.840" style="s2">worried you may never come back up or</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.660" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">you might get absolutely destroyed and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.840" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">the fear just washes off of you like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.760" end="00:38:34.830" style="s2">know dirt in a shower and you just stand</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:36.660" style="s2">there and and it&#39;s just you feel pure</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.830" end="00:38:41.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like all your sins are</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.660" end="00:38:43.560" style="s2">forgiven or something and and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.400" end="00:38:45.600" style="s2">why that&#39;s what I love so much about big</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.560" end="00:38:50.040" style="s2">wave surfing is it just makes me feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.600" end="00:38:51.840" style="s2">most alive and the more I do it I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.040" end="00:38:55.160" style="s2">it&#39;s given me it&#39;s making everyday</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.840" end="00:38:59.820" style="s2">normal life harder like to to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.160" end="00:39:02.460" style="s2">so we talked about this recently with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.820" end="00:39:04.380" style="s2">pornographic actress that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.460" end="00:39:06.470" style="s2">issue about what happens when you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.380" end="00:39:08.970" style="s2">something that hyper stimulates you and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.470" end="00:39:10.500" style="s2">you have a trouble getting back to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.970" end="00:39:12.360" style="s2">normal baseline because there is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.500" end="00:39:15.360" style="s2">sort of hedonic shift in what your</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.360" end="00:39:18.360" style="s2">normal is sure and in large measure what</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.360" end="00:39:20.550" style="s2">I see is how do you have a normal day</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.360" end="00:39:23.160" style="s2">after your day at the office being</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.550" end="00:39:27.090" style="s2">playing on the sides of temporary cliffs</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.160" end="00:39:30.330" style="s2">oh it&#39;s I I mean if I&#39;m being at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.090" end="00:39:32.700" style="s2">honest it&#39;s a normal average day is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.330" end="00:39:34.500" style="s2">tortured like sure it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.700" end="00:39:36.900" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have that same</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.500" end="00:39:39.390" style="s2">stimulation you&#39;re not there&#39;s I guess</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.900" end="00:39:40.740" style="s2">things start to lose purpose because</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.390" end="00:39:42.780" style="s2">when you&#39;re riding a big wave there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.740" end="00:39:45.600" style="s2">purpose of living right you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.780" end="00:39:47.250" style="s2">purpose of like living in as you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.600" end="00:39:49.530" style="s2">you&#39;re you don&#39;t want to die but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.250" end="00:39:51.540" style="s2">also you&#39;re also experiencing something</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.530" end="00:39:53.880" style="s2">so pure and profound it feels bigger</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.540" end="00:39:56.220" style="s2">than yourself you know like the act of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.880" end="00:39:59.119" style="s2">riding a big wave feels there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.220" end="00:40:01.489" style="s2">like that the egotistical kind of feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:02.930" style="s2">Godley for one moment you know like so</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.489" end="00:40:05.329" style="s2">this is the thing flying too close to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.930" end="00:40:07.339" style="s2">the Sun like Icarus you know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.329" end="00:40:08.749" style="s2">waiting for your wings to marys in front</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.339" end="00:40:11.029" style="s2">of the gods you see that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.749" end="00:40:13.519" style="s2">element of Greek tragedy and what I see</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.029" end="00:40:15.739" style="s2">is that I&#39;m used to watching big waves</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.519" end="00:40:17.509" style="s2">where there&#39;s some different dot on</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.739" end="00:40:20.569" style="s2">every wave and I watch the dot which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.509" end="00:40:22.069" style="s2">this human being just just hang on for</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.569" end="00:40:24.829" style="s2">the ride and if they can just do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.069" end="00:40:27.890" style="s2">that was that was what I was used to and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.829" end="00:40:31.519" style="s2">then like I see the dot jump and do a</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.890" end="00:40:35.450" style="s2">360 on the way like it&#39;s playing and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.519" end="00:40:38.210" style="s2">does it feels like mythically wrong like</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.450" end="00:40:42.019" style="s2">wait that wave is huge but I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.210" end="00:40:44.359" style="s2">play with it rather than just just</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.019" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">submit and accept it well so kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.359" end="00:40:48.499" style="s2">like if you have you&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:49.729" style="s2">Christopher Nolan&#39;s inception right you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.499" end="00:40:51.769" style="s2">know how they go from a dream into</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.729" end="00:40:53.479" style="s2">another yeah the way I look at it like</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.769" end="00:40:55.549" style="s2">riding a big wave is you have the base</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.479" end="00:40:57.890" style="s2">line which is just the act of riding it</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.549" end="00:41:00.079" style="s2">going straight surviving it kicking out</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.890" end="00:41:02.719" style="s2">you have that 30 second experience and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.079" end="00:41:04.130" style="s2">then you can and then there&#39;s and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.719" end="00:41:08.420" style="s2">and there that takes a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.130" end="00:41:10.729" style="s2">focus and for me doing maneuvers on big</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.420" end="00:41:13.549" style="s2">waves all of a sudden it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.729" end="00:41:16.099" style="s2">like putting that one scary experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.549" end="00:41:18.499" style="s2">and putting it to the side and as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.099" end="00:41:20.719" style="s2">rotating through a maneuver or a trick</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.499" end="00:41:22.190" style="s2">like a 360 down the wave I have to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.719" end="00:41:25.039" style="s2">looking at the water I&#39;m focused on</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.190" end="00:41:27.499" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with myself and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.039" end="00:41:30.109" style="s2">it&#39;s like when I land I pop back into a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.499" end="00:41:32.299" style="s2">different part of reality and then when</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.109" end="00:41:34.759" style="s2">I kick out I&#39;m back to like normal</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.299" end="00:41:37.039" style="s2">reality mice mice my baseline so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.759" end="00:41:39.739" style="s2">aware of several different colonies</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.039" end="00:41:41.989" style="s2">living between the same set of ears the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.739" end="00:41:43.999" style="s2">trade-off on an individual wave hundred</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.989" end="00:41:45.979" style="s2">percent yeah so and I could go like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.999" end="00:41:50.569" style="s2">feel like the most I&#39;ve been able to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.979" end="00:41:52.700" style="s2">is maybe three levels deep or maybe four</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.569" end="00:41:55.519" style="s2">for when you go four levels deep it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.700" end="00:41:57.469" style="s2">when you&#39;re riding a wave and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.519" end="00:42:00.109" style="s2">sudden you don&#39;t you&#39;re not you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.469" end="00:42:02.059" style="s2">such the edge you don&#39;t know that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.109" end="00:42:03.739" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing to make it</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.059" end="00:42:05.749" style="s2">work and when you kick out you start</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.739" end="00:42:07.519" style="s2">questioning what you did and then you</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.749" end="00:42:09.529" style="s2">actually forget how you did it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.519" end="00:42:12.110" style="s2">like what just happened and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.529" end="00:42:15.290" style="s2">like me sitting here in</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.110" end="00:42:17.720" style="s2">heart of Los Angeles I almost feel like</p>

<p begin="00:42:21.380" end="00:42:24.830" style="s2">a hundred times but I question if I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.330" end="00:42:27.110" style="s2">ever do it again like I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.830" end="00:42:29.000" style="s2">have the confidence to say that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:42:30.830" end="00:42:37.910" style="s2">some cool dude that I met in Maui and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.300" end="00:42:41.750" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that suggests that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.910" end="00:42:44.120" style="s2">person that I&#39;ve seen on these myriad</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.750" end="00:42:46.610" style="s2">different videos is that guy in other</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.120" end="00:42:50.090" style="s2">words you&#39;re talking about this but</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.610" end="00:42:52.100" style="s2">there&#39;s no aspect of the the person who</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.090" end="00:42:53.450" style="s2">does those incredible things you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.100" end="00:42:55.370" style="s2">now just saying well here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.450" end="00:42:57.290" style="s2">remember about that yeah and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.370" end="00:42:58.850" style="s2">meet somebody like you know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.290" end="00:43:00.980" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to Albert Einstein and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.850" end="00:43:02.300" style="s2">you were going to McDonald&#39;s with him</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.980" end="00:43:04.370" style="s2">and you were just ordering hamburger</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.300" end="00:43:07.610" style="s2">there would be nothing Albert Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.370" end="00:43:10.460" style="s2">ish about his act of ordering a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.610" end="00:43:12.080" style="s2">hamburger and so like it&#39;s a very weird</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.460" end="00:43:14.750" style="s2">thing the way the mundane and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.080" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">transcendent collide and sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.750" end="00:43:21.050" style="s2">person who has this transcendent ability</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">when they&#39;re in their mundane head they</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.050" end="00:43:22.820" style="s2">can&#39;t even imagine that that&#39;s who they</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.820" end="00:43:28.100" style="s2">do you ever have that oh yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:29.810" style="s2">totally have that it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.100" end="00:43:31.940" style="s2">fear will I ever get to that level again</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.810" end="00:43:33.890" style="s2">sort of thing but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.940" end="00:43:37.460" style="s2">moment where I I&#39;m starting to identify</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.890" end="00:43:39.500" style="s2">when the switch happens and it usually</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.460" end="00:43:41.360" style="s2">happens because to get to big waves you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.500" end="00:43:43.700" style="s2">usually round a corner whether it&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.360" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">boat or a car or whatever we&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.700" end="00:43:46.610" style="s2">down the beach you come around a corner</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:48.590" style="s2">and all of a sudden the wave is revealed</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.610" end="00:43:50.510" style="s2">it&#39;s like the reveal of a movie like</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.590" end="00:43:51.890" style="s2">okay all of a sudden you see the monster</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.510" end="00:43:53.480" style="s2">or you see the building or you see</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.890" end="00:43:56.150" style="s2">whatever it is that you feel that with</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.480" end="00:43:57.890" style="s2">you oh my god every time so you turn the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.150" end="00:44:00.500" style="s2">corner and you see plumes of spray going</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.890" end="00:44:02.360" style="s2">hundreds of feet in the air and in in</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.500" end="00:44:04.850" style="s2">the distance maybe a mile away you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.360" end="00:44:06.200" style="s2">this monster breaking and and your heart</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.850" end="00:44:08.150" style="s2">starts to skip a little bit and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.200" end="00:44:10.250" style="s2">like oh my gosh like here we go and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.150" end="00:44:12.170" style="s2">could start feeling the switch kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.250" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">starting to move and then all this and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.170" end="00:44:18.040" style="s2">pull up and I see the the canvas that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:20.450" style="s2">the wave breaking and the perfection and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.040" end="00:44:22.970" style="s2">any fear that I had the night before</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.450" end="00:44:24.590" style="s2">because it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t live in</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.970" end="00:44:25.310" style="s2">fear at all like the night before I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.590" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">like scratch my</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.310" end="00:44:29.540" style="s2">like I got myself into what am i doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.010" end="00:44:32.660" style="s2">was it like Bruce woohoo coming Bruce</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.540" end="00:44:34.340" style="s2">Banner is gonna have to fight and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.660" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">not the Hulk yet and so he has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.340" end="00:44:39.020" style="s2">approach the fight and before it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">the Hulk at some level it&#39;s terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.020" end="00:44:42.020" style="s2">because you&#39;re signing up to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:43.460" style="s2">something that you&#39;re not capable of</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.020" end="00:44:46.340" style="s2">doing until you make the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.460" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a great analogy definitely because</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.340" end="00:44:50.210" style="s2">I&#39;ll pull up on the jet ski and I wanna</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:51.950" style="s2">see a wave just submit and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.210" end="00:44:54.680" style="s2">sixty-four wave and it&#39;s terrifying and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.950" end="00:44:56.390" style="s2">and and you know everything about it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.680" end="00:44:57.560" style="s2">like you want to avoid being caught in</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.390" end="00:44:59.270" style="s2">there you know like how can the human</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.560" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">body live through something like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.270" end="00:45:03.980" style="s2">yeah but then all of a sudden I get all</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:05.480" style="s2">this energy and I and I&#39;m like let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.980" end="00:45:07.130" style="s2">let&#39;s go and I&#39;m whoever I&#39;m with I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.480" end="00:45:08.930" style="s2">trying to rush them off the jet ski or</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.130" end="00:45:10.430" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to grab my board to paddle</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.930" end="00:45:11.960" style="s2">out or I&#39;m getting them to drive me and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.430" end="00:45:14.840" style="s2">I&#39;m like let&#39;s go and I&#39;ll find myself</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.960" end="00:45:16.280" style="s2">sitting out on the water doing like I</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.840" end="00:45:17.450" style="s2">have kind of this breathing exercise I</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.280" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">do or it&#39;s like breathe in for two</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.450" end="00:45:20.900" style="s2">seconds out what you said it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:22.580" style="s2">really mellow and it&#39;s just really to</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.900" end="00:45:25.370" style="s2">get a lot of oxygen in my lungs but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.580" end="00:45:29.240" style="s2">also to like have like sharpness of mind</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.370" end="00:45:30.380" style="s2">and and then sometimes for waves in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.240" end="00:45:32.090" style="s2">set will come in so it&#39;s not like just</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.380" end="00:45:34.010" style="s2">one big wave comes in it breaks there</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.090" end="00:45:37.700" style="s2">could be four stacked in the horizon we</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.010" end="00:45:40.100" style="s2">call those a set and and and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.700" end="00:45:41.840" style="s2">it&#39;s always a bit of chess to try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.100" end="00:45:43.580" style="s2">figure out which one&#39;s gonna be the best</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.840" end="00:45:45.290" style="s2">wave because I&#39;ve had millions of waves</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.580" end="00:45:46.970" style="s2">where I&#39;ve kicked out no you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.290" end="00:45:49.340" style="s2">millions but lots of waves where I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.970" end="00:45:51.800" style="s2">kicked out and you see the perfect big</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.340" end="00:45:53.630" style="s2">wave behind it and you&#39;re like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.800" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">why did I go on the first one and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.630" end="00:45:58.910" style="s2">kicking yourself but so so I&#39;m usually</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:46:02.180" style="s2">I&#39;m usually really like I would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.910" end="00:46:04.220" style="s2">reserved in the fact when like I hate</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.180" end="00:46:05.750" style="s2">asking people for to go out of their way</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.220" end="00:46:07.100" style="s2">for something like hey you know is it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.750" end="00:46:08.780" style="s2">okay like even if I&#39;m staying at</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.100" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">someone&#39;s house like it&#39;s okay if I get</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.780" end="00:46:12.290" style="s2">some water you know it&#39;s just who I am I</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:15.140" style="s2">would say on like a base level but all</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.290" end="00:46:18.890" style="s2">of a sudden I think my commander inside</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.140" end="00:46:21.080" style="s2">me or kind of like the general sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.890" end="00:46:22.280" style="s2">comes out where it&#39;s like my driver I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.080" end="00:46:24.470" style="s2">telling me exactly when you see I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.280" end="00:46:26.780" style="s2">number two which is the second way no no</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.470" end="00:46:28.820" style="s2">no no faster faster let&#39;s go and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.780" end="00:46:30.710" style="s2">send I&#39;m yelling and I love this person</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.820" end="00:46:32.600" style="s2">and later on I feel guilty night</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.710" end="00:46:34.490" style="s2">sometimes apologize but they understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.600" end="00:46:37.220" style="s2">that I&#39;m out there with a purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.490" end="00:46:39.079" style="s2">trying to catch a wave and it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.220" end="00:46:40.609" style="s2">do have a right to command a situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.079" end="00:46:42.619" style="s2">you do have some kind of a split</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.609" end="00:46:44.599" style="s2">personality because like when we came</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.619" end="00:46:47.719" style="s2">out and visited you you could not have</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.599" end="00:46:49.249" style="s2">been more hospitable to some like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.719" end="00:46:50.809" style="s2">the funny part is if I understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.249" end="00:46:52.910" style="s2">correctly you first found out about me</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.809" end="00:46:55.190" style="s2">because you were a Joe Rogan watcher</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.910" end="00:46:56.630" style="s2">yeah exactly and I said hey are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.190" end="00:46:58.190" style="s2">watching what&#39;s going on and surfing</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.630" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">that&#39;s where innovation is happening now</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.190" end="00:47:00.380" style="s2">and I shouted out your name that I see</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:02.390" style="s2">on Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.380" end="00:47:04.369" style="s2">hey this dude shouted out my name or</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.390" end="00:47:05.559" style="s2">something I&#39;m thinking like okay how</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.369" end="00:47:07.940" style="s2">does that guy even know that I exist</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.559" end="00:47:09.769" style="s2">that you know what it&#39;s the same way how</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.940" end="00:47:12.410" style="s2">does someone like you know I exist no no</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.769" end="00:47:15.739" style="s2">it&#39;s like funny I just feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.410" end="00:47:17.690" style="s2">know in my world I&#39;m trying to break out</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.739" end="00:47:20.359" style="s2">of my own personal bubble like and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.690" end="00:47:22.009" style="s2">not a bubble in terms of like get seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.359" end="00:47:24.289" style="s2">by other people more but it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.009" end="00:47:28.219" style="s2">think we all find ourselves in our own</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.289" end="00:47:29.809" style="s2">world and in and I in fact if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.219" end="00:47:31.849" style="s2">learned anything from big wave riding is</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.809" end="00:47:33.920" style="s2">this trying to be uncomfortable more</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.849" end="00:47:35.380" style="s2">often like everyday if I can be a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.920" end="00:47:38.630" style="s2">uncomfortable it&#39;s probably positive</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.630" end="00:47:42.950" style="s2">something that I&#39;m not used to it with</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.940" end="00:47:44.660" style="s2">whatsoever you know let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.950" end="00:47:46.009" style="s2">some of the technology that&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.660" end="00:47:47.359" style="s2">what it is that you do if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.009" end="00:47:49.249" style="s2">thinking about like you&#39;re a painter</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.359" end="00:47:50.719" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about canvas all right</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.249" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">well now you&#39;ve got more brushes and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.719" end="00:47:54.920" style="s2">paints to paint with so what I see and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m not getting it from</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.920" end="00:48:01.999" style="s2">outside so that this foil the hydrofoil</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:04.459" style="s2">underneath the board&#39;s is making it</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.999" end="00:48:06.680" style="s2">possible to be like effectively Aladdin</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.459" end="00:48:09.140" style="s2">on a magic carpet where you&#39;re surfing</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.680" end="00:48:11.949" style="s2">above the water then there&#39;s this kite</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.140" end="00:48:14.959" style="s2">thing going on where you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.949" end="00:48:17.959" style="s2">accessing the wind to jump at levels</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.959" end="00:48:21.319" style="s2">that just seem absolutely insane there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.959" end="00:48:25.809" style="s2">safety equipment which is weirdly like</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.319" end="00:48:28.279" style="s2">only recently available to decrease the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.809" end="00:48:30.650" style="s2">probability that you&#39;re gonna get held</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.279" end="00:48:32.509" style="s2">down I think what all those things have</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.650" end="00:48:35.900" style="s2">in common and this is what&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.509" end="00:48:38.029" style="s2">about water sports and the the real</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.900" end="00:48:38.839" style="s2">connection is things are invented out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.029" end="00:48:41.390" style="s2">necessity</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.839" end="00:48:44.029" style="s2">just like everything in life but really</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.390" end="00:48:47.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s in created in the name of fun</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.029" end="00:48:48.890" style="s2">like how can I have more fun what can we</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.180" end="00:48:50.959" style="s2">do to make it more fun oh this is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.890" end="00:48:52.550" style="s2">solution and like big wave surfing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.959" end="00:48:54.260" style="s2">fun until you drown</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.550" end="00:48:56.330" style="s2">so that inflation vest you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.260" end="00:48:57.500" style="s2">about it&#39;s a similar concept is the one</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.330" end="00:49:00.440" style="s2">that&#39;s under your seat when you fly on</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.500" end="00:49:02.450" style="s2">an airplane co2 canister and air bag in</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.440" end="00:49:04.250" style="s2">a wetsuit pull the cord the thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.450" end="00:49:06.860" style="s2">inflates and if you become a buoy and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.250" end="00:49:08.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s in the name of fun because now</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.860" end="00:49:10.670" style="s2">all of a sudden it&#39;s given people like</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.840" end="00:49:13.070" style="s2">me the opportunity to ride these big</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.670" end="00:49:16.190" style="s2">waves and focus less on trying to not</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.070" end="00:49:17.930" style="s2">drown but more on what can we do on</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.190" end="00:49:19.580" style="s2">these big waves like how what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.930" end="00:49:22.369" style="s2">experiences can I have on them and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.580" end="00:49:25.180" style="s2">that&#39;s where I say that the limit is</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.369" end="00:49:27.500" style="s2">still yet to be totally tapped into</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.180" end="00:49:29.210" style="s2">especially with tow-in surfing paddle</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.500" end="00:49:31.910" style="s2">surfing people are put constantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.210" end="00:49:33.890" style="s2">pushing the edge because it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.910" end="00:49:37.130" style="s2">act of it&#39;s it&#39;s really like going</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.890" end="00:49:38.290" style="s2">hunting with you know a knife you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.130" end="00:49:41.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like going hunting with a knife</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.290" end="00:49:42.830" style="s2">versus you know going out with all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.420" end="00:49:44.570" style="s2">technology in the world and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.830" end="00:49:47.450" style="s2">different it&#39;s a different approach and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.570" end="00:49:48.770" style="s2">some might say it&#39;s it&#39;s not pure</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.450" end="00:49:51.130" style="s2">whatever wool those people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.770" end="00:49:55.490" style="s2">actually surf equates though who cares</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.130" end="00:49:57.800" style="s2">but for me I love technology yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.490" end="00:50:00.350" style="s2">love when they merge with like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.800" end="00:50:02.420" style="s2">the craziest thing you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.350" end="00:50:03.950" style="s2">with technology I&#39;m constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.420" end="00:50:05.750" style="s2">figure out how to do something better</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.950" end="00:50:08.060" style="s2">you know I think what blows people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:10.340" style="s2">minds away the most is the hydrofoil</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.060" end="00:50:11.960" style="s2">yeah and what those capabilities are</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.340" end="00:50:14.300" style="s2">it&#39;s like an underwater airplane</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.960" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">attached to a large fin attached to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.300" end="00:50:18.560" style="s2">board and lets you glide like your</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:21.290" style="s2">seagull and gives you an illusion of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.560" end="00:50:23.450" style="s2">flight and I think almost everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.290" end="00:50:26.330" style="s2">a dream of wanting to just soar through</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.450" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">the air you know like be a bird and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.330" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">can&#39;t see what&#39;s lifting you up out of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.160" end="00:50:31.490" style="s2">the water when you&#39;re riding these</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:32.840" style="s2">things all you can all you feel it see</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.490" end="00:50:36.020" style="s2">is the board around you and the water</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.840" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">moving and when I first did it I started</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.020" end="00:50:41.480" style="s2">when I was nine years old but when I</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:43.820" style="s2">kind of told you I&#39;m 27 but but there</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.480" end="00:50:46.310" style="s2">was 2016 was kind of the year of</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.820" end="00:50:49.130" style="s2">reinvention of it kind of the rebirth of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.310" end="00:50:50.750" style="s2">it originally it was adopted from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.130" end="00:50:53.660" style="s2">air chair which was what you would ride</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.750" end="00:50:55.250" style="s2">behind a water-ski boat and those guys</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.660" end="00:50:56.869" style="s2">would sit down on they do incredible</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.250" end="00:50:58.220" style="s2">maneuvers but they had the rope and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.869" end="00:51:02.170" style="s2">know you had to be rode around a lake</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.220" end="00:51:04.820" style="s2">and then Laird Hamilton Rush Randall</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.170" end="00:51:05.600" style="s2">Dave Kalama Derek Dorner all these guys</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.820" end="00:51:07.850" style="s2">strapped</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.600" end="00:51:09.290" style="s2">crew took it put snowboard boots on it</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.850" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">and their goal was read the biggest way</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.290" end="00:51:12.620" style="s2">he&#39;s ever ridden</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:14.300" style="s2">another problem with riding big waves</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.620" end="00:51:17.270" style="s2">and this is what led them to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.300" end="00:51:19.370" style="s2">hydrofoil was the chops going up the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.270" end="00:51:21.410" style="s2">face Levite gets so big that on normal</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.370" end="00:51:23.420" style="s2">board you can&#39;t go fast enough hydrofoil</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.410" end="00:51:25.850" style="s2">is a giant fin it cuts right through it</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.420" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">like a hot knife through butter and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.850" end="00:51:30.130" style="s2">they that was they were pushing it in</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:33.050" style="s2">the big wave realm and then come 2016 I</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.130" end="00:51:35.060" style="s2">had a vision of instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.050" end="00:51:36.230" style="s2">ride the biggest waves in the world on</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.060" end="00:51:37.790" style="s2">this why don&#39;t we try to ride the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.230" end="00:51:40.300" style="s2">smallest waves in the world on this and</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.790" end="00:51:42.980" style="s2">that opened the door the floodgates for</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.300" end="00:51:45.380" style="s2">making terrible surf anywhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.980" end="00:51:47.870" style="s2">world feel like it&#39;s the best waves on</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.380" end="00:51:50.150" style="s2">the planet and because you don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.870" end="00:51:52.490" style="s2">perfect wave to feel like you&#39;re on one</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.150" end="00:51:55.130" style="s2">because you you can glide on parts of</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.490" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">the wave that are far away from where a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.130" end="00:52:00.560" style="s2">traditional surfboard has its limit and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:03.620" style="s2">it also open the door for crossing large</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.560" end="00:52:06.350" style="s2">bodies of water now for fun what we do</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.620" end="00:52:08.450" style="s2">in Hawaii and we do races now is we</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.350" end="00:52:11.540" style="s2">cross between each Island riding a board</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.450" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;s mate at times no wider than four</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.540" end="00:52:16.700" style="s2">feet and you&#39;re hovering and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.720" end="00:52:19.460" style="s2">like a bird and you go from one Island</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.700" end="00:52:21.260" style="s2">do you know for like Molokai to Oahu</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.460" end="00:52:23.720" style="s2">yeah like Molokai - well every island</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.260" end="00:52:25.220" style="s2">you can you can go between it&#39;s just how</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.720" end="00:52:27.770" style="s2">long do you want to be out on the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.220" end="00:52:31.490" style="s2">for what&#39;s your time in Molokai to Oahu</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.770" end="00:52:33.800" style="s2">is for is a is a 32-mile channel</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.490" end="00:52:36.440" style="s2">crossing and I could do it just above</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.800" end="00:52:38.900" style="s2">two hours two hour mark is right there</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.440" end="00:52:42.440" style="s2">which is exciting but the coolest thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.900" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">is is like if there&#39;s a when I first did</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.440" end="00:52:44.930" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:48.410" style="s2">there was this there&#39;s this you for</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.930" end="00:52:50.420" style="s2">doing by pumping well so pumping is kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.410" end="00:52:51.950" style="s2">of like the flapping of a bird you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.420" end="00:52:53.750" style="s2">like that&#39;s how they create more lift</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.950" end="00:52:56.330" style="s2">when they need it but if you play your</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.750" end="00:52:59.120" style="s2">cards right and you the best way to read</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.330" end="00:53:01.070" style="s2">the open ocean swells is imagine you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.120" end="00:53:05.780" style="s2">playing a game of chess or if you were</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.070" end="00:53:07.550" style="s2">playing kind of like you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.780" end="00:53:09.170" style="s2">that game like in an arcade where the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.550" end="00:53:10.670" style="s2">ball bounces around and it you get a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.170" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">bunch of different points and you try to</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.670" end="00:53:15.230" style="s2">get it into that one like a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:16.970" style="s2">point hold - what is it called again the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.230" end="00:53:18.580" style="s2">pachinko that the Japanese want a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.970" end="00:53:20.080" style="s2">pinball pinball okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.580" end="00:53:22.600" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to pin ball between swells</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.080" end="00:53:24.250" style="s2">ting ting ting and if you you go from</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.600" end="00:53:27.820" style="s2">one cell to the next to the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.250" end="00:53:30.790" style="s2">once you&#39;re gaining the energy and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.820" end="00:53:32.740" style="s2">lift underwater the vortex that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.790" end="00:53:34.150" style="s2">up these little waves and creating lifts</p>

<p begin="00:53:34.150" end="00:53:39.070" style="s2">and a perfect line you&#39;re you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.510" end="00:53:40.660" style="s2">turning and you&#39;re snowboarding it feels</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.070" end="00:53:43.390" style="s2">like you&#39;re going downhill the whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.660" end="00:53:44.950" style="s2">time if you and you might pump to get to</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.390" end="00:53:47.920" style="s2">the next swell if you have to if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.950" end="00:53:49.750" style="s2">spread out far enough and it&#39;s so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.920" end="00:53:51.700" style="s2">would say more even it&#39;s physically</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.750" end="00:53:53.700" style="s2">taxing you use every fiber of your body</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.700" end="00:53:56.500" style="s2">because you&#39;re using your arms to create</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.700" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">energy to help your legs pump this board</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.500" end="00:54:01.030" style="s2">to go faster because it&#39;s always about</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:03.430" style="s2">going quicker and then your mind has to</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.030" end="00:54:05.290" style="s2">focus on reading the ocean and if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.430" end="00:54:07.720" style="s2">miss time it or you miss read it you</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.290" end="00:54:09.610" style="s2">stop you come to a dead stop and so if</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.720" end="00:54:12.490" style="s2">you if you&#39;re really on it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.610" end="00:54:15.850" style="s2">reading I feel like it&#39;s when I read a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.490" end="00:54:17.710" style="s2">really like dense book lots of heavy</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.850" end="00:54:19.990" style="s2">words that I don&#39;t understand I&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.710" end="00:54:21.880" style="s2">to really think about it that is like</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.990" end="00:54:23.950" style="s2">doing a channel crossing because every</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.880" end="00:54:25.780" style="s2">single wave you see isn&#39;t the same it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.950" end="00:54:28.750" style="s2">all slightly different and you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.780" end="00:54:30.820" style="s2">to navigate it and it&#39;s playing chess</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.750" end="00:54:32.680" style="s2">you know you if you make one mistake all</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.820" end="00:54:34.570" style="s2">of a sudden you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re down</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.680" end="00:54:37.480" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting I mean I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.570" end="00:54:39.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen you do this and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.480" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">have the same visual appeal if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.670" end="00:54:45.340" style="s2">not part of this world I&#39;ve also seen</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:47.590" style="s2">the motorized version of this which</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.340" end="00:54:51.430" style="s2">definitely looks like a magic carpet for</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.590" end="00:54:52.870" style="s2">sure and it is it is bizarre just I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.430" end="00:54:54.820" style="s2">the physics almost don&#39;t feel like they</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.870" end="00:54:57.460" style="s2">make sense to see the board that far out</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.820" end="00:55:00.070" style="s2">of the water it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.460" end="00:55:04.990" style="s2">physics yeah it&#39;s also everything that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.070" end="00:55:07.990" style="s2">I&#39;m doing now I mean obviously is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.990" end="00:55:10.150" style="s2">all physics and I never was a kid I</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.990" end="00:55:12.760" style="s2">never thought I&#39;d be into physics but</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.150" end="00:55:14.830" style="s2">the only way physics I understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.760" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">physics it&#39;s through kind of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.830" end="00:55:19.660" style="s2">devices or kind of these approaches it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:21.100" style="s2">almost my my version of math you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.660" end="00:55:23.140" style="s2">it&#39;s like well if you take a board here</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.100" end="00:55:24.670" style="s2">and you do this and with the wind and</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.140" end="00:55:26.260" style="s2">you rotate that way you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.670" end="00:55:27.880" style="s2">but let&#39;s talk about this in a weird</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.260" end="00:55:31.569" style="s2">context so there&#39;s that now there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.880" end="00:55:34.089" style="s2">these engineered waves oh yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.569" end="00:55:36.339" style="s2">people are actually saying look if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.089" end="00:55:40.089" style="s2">want a a regular experience we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.339" end="00:55:42.609" style="s2">design a wave in a wave pool and make it</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.089" end="00:55:43.569" style="s2">as pretty and regular as you want I</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.609" end="00:55:44.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we&#39;ve gotten to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.569" end="00:55:46.809" style="s2">point where you can dial your own</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.890" end="00:55:48.759" style="s2">irregularities into it but maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.809" end="00:55:51.699" style="s2">coming though yeah I think what makes</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.759" end="00:55:53.829" style="s2">surfing so fun is when you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.699" end="00:55:56.259" style="s2">wave it&#39;s the unpredictability you you</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.829" end="00:55:58.839" style="s2">can kind of read what the waves doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.259" end="00:56:00.489" style="s2">and you can make the most informed and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.839" end="00:56:02.709" style="s2">best decisions on it but you get on</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.489" end="00:56:04.959" style="s2">these mechanical waves like at the surf</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.709" end="00:56:06.609" style="s2">ranch or you know these leaders Kelly</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.959" end="00:56:08.680" style="s2">Slater&#39;s pool and it&#39;s almost like too</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.609" end="00:56:11.940" style="s2">perfect you get on it and you&#39;re it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.680" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">like you&#39;re all of a sudden having to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.940" end="00:56:15.819" style="s2">figure out your own runs right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:17.170" style="s2">like okay I can do two turns here and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.819" end="00:56:18.549" style="s2">can get barreled and I could do this and</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.170" end="00:56:21.699" style="s2">you could sort of do that in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.549" end="00:56:24.130" style="s2">but I mean the wave pool is insane if</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.699" end="00:56:25.660" style="s2">you want to get better because you get</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.130" end="00:56:28.239" style="s2">the wave of the day every single time</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.660" end="00:56:29.739" style="s2">you stand up and a lot of times you</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.239" end="00:56:31.900" style="s2">never get the wave of the day when</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.739" end="00:56:32.859" style="s2">you&#39;re surfing in the ocean I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.900" end="00:56:34.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something about being in</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.859" end="00:56:36.869" style="s2">saltwater and I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.900" end="00:56:39.910" style="s2">about kind of that natural element and</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.869" end="00:56:42.969" style="s2">being in line with nature in one of her</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.910" end="00:56:45.069" style="s2">most dynamic moments right that is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.969" end="00:56:48.479" style="s2">it makes you feel good like really</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.069" end="00:56:50.709" style="s2">really good but that being said as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.479" end="00:56:52.900" style="s2">professional athlete the more time I</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.709" end="00:56:55.209" style="s2">could spend in a wave fool the better</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.900" end="00:56:57.999" style="s2">because it just means that I&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.209" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">focus on things that I couldn&#39;t I may</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.999" end="00:57:01.749" style="s2">you only get one chance to try</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:03.640" style="s2">so I surfing so hard it&#39;s the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.749" end="00:57:05.079" style="s2">word in the world because you go out</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.640" end="00:57:06.699" style="s2">there with the intention to learn a new</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.079" end="00:57:09.339" style="s2">trick you may never get the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.699" end="00:57:11.529" style="s2">one or you may get one opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.339" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">you may blow it because you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.529" end="00:57:14.920" style="s2">learn how to do the high-end and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:18.579" style="s2">only way to get high in is in a pool</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.920" end="00:57:22.119" style="s2">like that or to live you know you or</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.579" end="00:57:23.979" style="s2">travel traveling a ton and for most</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.119" end="00:57:25.719" style="s2">people they can&#39;t travel a time for me</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.979" end="00:57:28.089" style="s2">I&#39;m lucky that it&#39;s in my job</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.719" end="00:57:29.259" style="s2">description to do it with big wave</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.089" end="00:57:31.749" style="s2">surfing nothing about this would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.259" end="00:57:34.509" style="s2">going surfing the wave surfing is so</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.749" end="00:57:35.680" style="s2">rare went them times when I most want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.509" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">go out there and do something in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:40.449" style="s2">most motivated the most physically fit</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:41.799" style="s2">it just doesn&#39;t exist nowhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.449" end="00:57:43.390" style="s2">world there&#39;s moments like right now</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.799" end="00:57:44.580" style="s2">there&#39;s nowhere on earth that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.390" end="00:57:46.650" style="s2">breaking the way out</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.580" end="00:57:48.240" style="s2">once it&#39;s a break or a big enough so</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.650" end="00:57:50.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like right you know you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.240" end="00:57:51.900" style="s2">at the forecast and you&#39;re jumping on</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.100" end="00:57:53.090" style="s2">flights two days before this wall hits</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.900" end="00:57:54.960" style="s2">you arrive the day before</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.090" end="00:57:57.000" style="s2">jet-lagged from Hawaii all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.960" end="00:57:59.550" style="s2">Europe you said surfers - you said to me</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.000" end="00:58:01.170" style="s2">surfers are some of the world&#39;s best ya</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.550" end="00:58:02.940" style="s2">know surfers without a doubt are</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.170" end="00:58:05.370" style="s2">probably some of the best meteorologists</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.940" end="00:58:08.190" style="s2">because there&#39;s more at stake than just</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.370" end="00:58:10.440" style="s2">a huge storm destroying something</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.190" end="00:58:13.950" style="s2">there&#39;s what&#39;s at stake is your</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.440" end="00:58:16.680" style="s2">enjoyment and and and it&#39;s personal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.950" end="00:58:20.250" style="s2">really personal so the people I talk to</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.680" end="00:58:23.280" style="s2">that our surfers that know how to read</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.250" end="00:58:25.470" style="s2">the ocean read the the information that</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.280" end="00:58:26.940" style="s2">comes out of NOAA or any of these other</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.470" end="00:58:31.500" style="s2">buoys that are scattered across the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.940" end="00:58:34.050" style="s2">planet satellites they they can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.500" end="00:58:36.930" style="s2">- basically the minute when a certain</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.050" end="00:58:39.930" style="s2">wave is gonna come in and that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.930" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">really cool is like you without you</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.930" end="00:58:43.320" style="s2">knowing it you&#39;re a meteorologist</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:45.420" style="s2">because you&#39;re like okay this is this</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.320" end="00:58:47.340" style="s2">tide mixed with this swell Direction</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.420" end="00:58:50.190" style="s2">mixed with these winds is gonna make it</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.340" end="00:58:54.510" style="s2">this way and you in the really good guys</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.190" end="00:58:56.370" style="s2">girls they can call it like okay at 7:00</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.510" end="00:58:58.710" style="s2">a.m. the waves gonna be pumping is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.370" end="00:59:00.600" style="s2">turn on and then you can show up 6:00</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.710" end="00:59:03.960" style="s2">a.m. it&#39;s not really that good semi damn</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.600" end="00:59:08.160" style="s2">boom it hits so it&#39;s it&#39;s really almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.960" end="00:59:10.460" style="s2">predicting the future so another</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.160" end="00:59:12.600" style="s2">question I had is about physics is</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.460" end="00:59:14.730" style="s2">there&#39;s this question about what is</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.600" end="00:59:16.950" style="s2">possible and I remember a description</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.730" end="00:59:20.700" style="s2">back in the early skateboarding days of</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.950" end="00:59:22.170" style="s2">like dog town yeah there was this</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.700" end="00:59:23.760" style="s2">question about nobody knew what happened</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.170" end="00:59:27.240" style="s2">what would happen if you went over the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.760" end="00:59:28.830" style="s2">lip of a swimming pool like they I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.240" end="00:59:31.980" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t calculate the actual</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.830" end="00:59:33.930" style="s2">physical consequences and so the lady in</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.980" end="00:59:35.370" style="s2">the lip of a swimming pool well like you</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.930" end="00:59:36.720" style="s2">know you had this drought in the early</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.370" end="00:59:38.820" style="s2">70s in California</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.720" end="00:59:39.810" style="s2">right right okay gotcha I was for some</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.820" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">reason I was thinking something</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.810" end="00:59:43.860" style="s2">different but with skating go above it</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:45.960" style="s2">right yeah yeah yeah and I think Tony</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.860" end="00:59:47.820" style="s2">Alva if I recall karate was he did the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.960" end="00:59:51.030" style="s2">first air or something was the first guy</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.820" end="00:59:52.380" style="s2">who said like I&#39;m gonna try it and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.030" end="00:59:53.790" style="s2">find out whether like they didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.380" end="00:59:55.380" style="s2">what would happen physically or</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.790" end="00:59:57.390" style="s2">something and it turned out that it</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.380" end="00:59:58.200" style="s2">worked and then it was like oh okay that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.390" end="01:00:00.060" style="s2">is possible</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.200" end="01:00:02.820" style="s2">now look at them and now look at them oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.060" end="01:00:04.980" style="s2">my god and I wonder like are there</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.820" end="01:00:07.290" style="s2">things where you&#39;re pretty sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.980" end="01:00:09.540" style="s2">possible but you like you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.290" end="01:00:12.630" style="s2">whether it&#39;s physically possible usually</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.540" end="01:00:15.750" style="s2">you get I feel like I get about 3/4 of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.630" end="01:00:17.250" style="s2">the way there and any you can&#39;t go any</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.750" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">further and you have to just try it at a</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.250" end="01:00:21.329" style="s2">certain point it&#39;s like it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:23.670" style="s2">think I could do that and you&#39;ve wrapped</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.329" end="01:00:25.560" style="s2">you you&#39;ve kind of played it all out in</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.670" end="01:00:26.670" style="s2">your head like I got this equipment this</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.560" end="01:00:28.500" style="s2">equipments gonna allow me to do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.670" end="01:00:29.520" style="s2">okay I need this type of way because</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.500" end="01:00:31.020" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna allow me what are you</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.520" end="01:00:32.550" style="s2">thinking about what&#39;s up next that might</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.020" end="01:00:35.160" style="s2">be possible that you don&#39;t know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.550" end="01:00:37.500" style="s2">possible you know what it&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.160" end="01:00:39.390" style="s2">because a lot of the things just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.500" end="01:00:41.220" style="s2">hit you like an epiphany like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.390" end="01:00:42.270" style="s2">like hit you it&#39;s like a baseball bat to</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.220" end="01:00:46.260" style="s2">the head all of a sudden you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.270" end="01:00:48.329" style="s2">like what and I can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.260" end="01:00:50.940" style="s2">X because because you have to kill me</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.329" end="01:00:52.920" style="s2">well no no I don&#39;t know it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.940" end="01:00:54.690" style="s2">crazy I&#39;ll this is how it happens</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.920" end="01:00:59.430" style="s2">literally be sitting out in the water</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.690" end="01:01:01.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s like all the stars all like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.430" end="01:01:03.359" style="s2">five brain cells I have kind of go</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.500" end="01:01:06.480" style="s2">ting ting ting they all line up and all</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.359" end="01:01:07.770" style="s2">of a sudden it&#39;s like oh oh my god that</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:09.300" style="s2">was right in front of me the whole time</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.770" end="01:01:11.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like staring me in the face but you</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.300" end="01:01:12.720" style="s2">don&#39;t see yet give me an example of one</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.010" end="01:01:14.940" style="s2">of those in the past that actually works</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.720" end="01:01:17.099" style="s2">well the epiphany was the hydrofoil for</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.940" end="01:01:19.140" style="s2">one because everyone was riding big</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.099" end="01:01:21.030" style="s2">waves and I was doing a lot of channel</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.140" end="01:01:22.890" style="s2">crossings on stand-up paddleboards or</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.030" end="01:01:25.410" style="s2">prone paddle boards or on a canoe and</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.890" end="01:01:27.180" style="s2">that&#39;s where your your board is a wet</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.410" end="01:01:29.849" style="s2">the wetted surface or you were the guy</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.180" end="01:01:31.800" style="s2">who thought to put the hydrofoil into</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.849" end="01:01:33.900" style="s2">channel crossings yeah I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.800" end="01:01:37.200" style="s2">that yeah so that was kind of like I</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.900" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">guess my sort of contribution to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.200" end="01:01:43.619" style="s2">sport and it was it came from necessity</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:45.869" style="s2">to want to go faster so I I basically</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.619" end="01:01:47.609" style="s2">pushed my physical limits and I could</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.869" end="01:01:48.780" style="s2">probably be faster now as I&#39;m older and</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.609" end="01:01:51.329" style="s2">I&#39;m better trained blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.780" end="01:01:52.530" style="s2">equipment&#39;s better but on my stand-up</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.329" end="01:01:54.270" style="s2">paddle board for example it was like</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.530" end="01:01:57.660" style="s2">gosh I just want to go fast all my other</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.270" end="01:02:00.390" style="s2">sports are I&#39;m going fast all the time</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.660" end="01:02:02.339" style="s2">and here I&#39;m limited to maybe maximum 14</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.390" end="01:02:04.680" style="s2">miles an hour downwind at peak speed</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.339" end="01:02:08.160" style="s2">average let&#39;s say 9 miles an hour 10</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.680" end="01:02:10.290" style="s2">miles an hour and and so the it was like</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.160" end="01:02:11.770" style="s2">gosh like all of a sudden I put like two</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.290" end="01:02:15.250" style="s2">and two together I&#39;m like Hydra</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.770" end="01:02:17.370" style="s2">and then I put down winter and they sort</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.250" end="01:02:19.420" style="s2">of cross and it&#39;s like well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.370" end="01:02:21.160" style="s2">obviously that should work I just need a</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.420" end="01:02:22.450" style="s2">bigger wing they were just using too</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.160" end="01:02:24.130" style="s2">small of wings that&#39;s why you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.450" end="01:02:26.980" style="s2">you need more lift you get a bigger wing</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.130" end="01:02:30.010" style="s2">and the first time I tried it in a wave</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.980" end="01:02:32.080" style="s2">I was like this is gonna work oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.010" end="01:02:34.150" style="s2">this is gonna work and then I went and</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.080" end="01:02:36.550" style="s2">did it and I ended up paddling like 3</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.150" end="01:02:39.100" style="s2">miles in the middle of the ocean and got</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.550" end="01:02:40.420" style="s2">up for a hundred yards maybe because the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.100" end="01:02:42.640" style="s2">equipment wasn&#39;t quite there yet right</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.420" end="01:02:44.890" style="s2">right but I got up and it was just</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.640" end="01:02:47.260" style="s2">enough to go oh my god and just hit me</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.890" end="01:02:51.190" style="s2">like in the hex I had been foiling since</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.260" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">I was 9 years old like on a tow board</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.190" end="01:02:56.200" style="s2">with the jet ski and how I would do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:58.210" style="s2">in bigger waves and and then with this</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.200" end="01:03:00.160" style="s2">it was like god I&#39;ve been doing it since</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.210" end="01:03:03.150" style="s2">on iron and it took me until now I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.160" end="01:03:07.540" style="s2">I was like what 24 or something no 25</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.150" end="01:03:10.030" style="s2">2016 and it&#39;s for it to click and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.540" end="01:03:11.080" style="s2">like oh god it was right there gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.030" end="01:03:12.820" style="s2">the whole time I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.080" end="01:03:15.670" style="s2">ever heard about this guy Freeman Dyson</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.820" end="01:03:18.610" style="s2">who&#39;s named Institute for Advanced Study</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.670" end="01:03:20.500" style="s2">and he was a great physicist also</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.610" end="01:03:23.260" style="s2">mathematician did not have a PhD in</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.500" end="01:03:24.550" style="s2">either subject he wrote an article which</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.260" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">I think might be called missed</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.550" end="01:03:29.500" style="s2">opportunities and he talks about Freeman</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:31.740" style="s2">Dyson the physicist needed a result of</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.500" end="01:03:34.810" style="s2">Freeman Dyson the mathematician and</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.740" end="01:03:36.790" style="s2">Freeman Dyson the human being who was</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.810" end="01:03:39.670" style="s2">both of these people was not having that</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.790" end="01:03:41.350" style="s2">conversation so the only person who had</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.670" end="01:03:43.480" style="s2">the result was Freeman Dyson the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.350" end="01:03:46.300" style="s2">mathematician but the physicist who was</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.480" end="01:03:48.340" style="s2">himself could not figure out how to ask</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.300" end="01:03:50.830" style="s2">the question to make the connection yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.340" end="01:03:53.170" style="s2">so there is this feeling that like the</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.830" end="01:03:57.160" style="s2">the feeling of discovery is often a</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.170" end="01:03:58.990" style="s2">feeling of stupidity like oh my god I</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.160" end="01:04:00.970" style="s2">could have done that at anytime and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.990" end="01:04:02.920" style="s2">just didn&#39;t well you just don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.970" end="01:04:04.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s invisible and then all</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.920" end="01:04:07.000" style="s2">of a sudden it&#39;s just there that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.480" end="01:04:08.530" style="s2">whole clear as day and you&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.000" end="01:04:11.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you find your way out</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.530" end="01:04:14.410" style="s2">of your how do you find these epiphanies</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.710" end="01:04:16.180" style="s2">yeah and and and like then you go back</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.410" end="01:04:19.240" style="s2">and you say to yourself well what was it</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.180" end="01:04:21.520" style="s2">on that particular day that caused me to</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.240" end="01:04:22.990" style="s2">look at a wall and really see that there</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.520" end="01:04:25.420" style="s2">was probably a door and you know or</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.990" end="01:04:27.700" style="s2">something like that and it&#39;s about being</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.420" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">open-minded to anything and that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.700" end="01:04:31.780" style="s2">think permeable well going back to being</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:33.040" style="s2">uncomfortable all the time if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.780" end="01:04:35.650" style="s2">willing to be uncomfortable all the time</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.040" end="01:04:38.170" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to see things from very</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.650" end="01:04:40.089" style="s2">different perspectives and oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.170" end="01:04:44.319" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna surprise yourself I always</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.089" end="01:04:46.359" style="s2">find myself talking a lot and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.319" end="01:04:48.250" style="s2">like but I everything I&#39;m saying I</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.359" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">already know I got it okay you got a</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.250" end="01:04:51.190" style="s2">list on your cell phone I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:54.460" style="s2">listening to yourself talking if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.190" end="01:04:55.720" style="s2">don&#39;t do that I mean how shocking is</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.460" end="01:04:58.510" style="s2">something I don&#39;t know how to convey to</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.720" end="01:05:01.510" style="s2">people how shocking is our own voice</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.510" end="01:05:04.359" style="s2">like if you go into a room where there</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.510" end="01:05:06.010" style="s2">is nobody else and you actually start</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.359" end="01:05:08.890" style="s2">talking and you realize that you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.010" end="01:05:11.410" style="s2">talking for yourself it is a terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.890" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">feeling realizing that the listener and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.410" end="01:05:16.390" style="s2">the speaker are not the same person</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:18.520" style="s2">okay no no it&#39;s it&#39;s split personalities</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.390" end="01:05:20.740" style="s2">for sure or I loved your inception</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.520" end="01:05:22.119" style="s2">comment along those lines as layers and</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.740" end="01:05:26.440" style="s2">layers there&#39;s just layers and layers</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.119" end="01:05:28.390" style="s2">and I think some people don&#39;t ever go</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.440" end="01:05:30.309" style="s2">beyond layer one because they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.390" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">you or they don&#39;t know that it or they</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.309" end="01:05:34.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know here&#39;s a question once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.079" end="01:05:36.190" style="s2">seen that there are layers and layers do</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.750" end="01:05:39.849" style="s2">you start looking for that everywhere in</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.190" end="01:05:41.650" style="s2">your life like okay so give me some are</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.849" end="01:05:43.900" style="s2">there any other transferable examples</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.650" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">where the same kind of breakthrough</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.900" end="01:05:49.750" style="s2">takes place that you can talk about I</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:51.910" style="s2">mean I think nothing I well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.750" end="01:05:54.069" style="s2">lot of things but there&#39;s there&#39;s little</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.910" end="01:05:56.440" style="s2">wins I call them you know when you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.069" end="01:05:58.329" style="s2">like minor epiphanies or little things</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.440" end="01:06:02.589" style="s2">that sort of just become apparent and</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.329" end="01:06:04.150" style="s2">and and obvious and and I think it</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.589" end="01:06:08.109" style="s2">happens with everyone whether we know it</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.150" end="01:06:09.700" style="s2">or not we&#39;re you&#39;re doing something and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.109" end="01:06:11.859" style="s2">you&#39;ve been trying it for a really long</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.700" end="01:06:13.329" style="s2">time like a trick on a wave you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.859" end="01:06:15.220" style="s2">trying it for a really really long time</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.329" end="01:06:19.540" style="s2">and then all of a sudden you decide to</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.220" end="01:06:21.460" style="s2">change one little thing and a really</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.540" end="01:06:24.010" style="s2">good saying for surfing is letting go</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.460" end="01:06:26.109" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s not letting go in the fact</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.010" end="01:06:27.490" style="s2">that you relax completely or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.109" end="01:06:29.680" style="s2">relaxing but it&#39;s different it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.490" end="01:06:31.000" style="s2">like letting go it&#39;s like letting go of</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.680" end="01:06:33.369" style="s2">your problems you know what I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.000" end="01:06:35.740" style="s2">like letting go in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.369" end="01:06:37.809" style="s2">have any control and and you just kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.740" end="01:06:39.770" style="s2">of like feel it&#39;s you let your physical</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.809" end="01:06:42.530" style="s2">being kind of you go to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.770" end="01:06:45.200" style="s2">close to the flow state but you also let</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.530" end="01:06:47.330" style="s2">someone else take the driving wheel you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.200" end="01:06:52.130" style="s2">know what I mean like in surfing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.330" end="01:06:54.140" style="s2">such a connection and that&#39;s this comes</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.130" end="01:06:55.550" style="s2">to to these moments where I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.140" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">I&#39;m in a movie sometimes and I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.550" end="01:06:59.000" style="s2">passenger seat and everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:00.500" style="s2">happening around me yeah but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.000" end="01:07:02.360" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m doing it I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.500" end="01:07:04.040" style="s2">there&#39;s someone else doing it for me and</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.360" end="01:07:05.540" style="s2">I&#39;m in the movie you know I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.040" end="01:07:07.430" style="s2">seeing it through someone else&#39;s eyes so</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.540" end="01:07:08.840" style="s2">this is a weird case like before we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.430" end="01:07:10.790" style="s2">talking about surrendering to the wave</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.840" end="01:07:12.380" style="s2">there&#39;s also this question about</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.790" end="01:07:15.470" style="s2">surrendering to the parts of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.380" end="01:07:17.720" style="s2">that you don&#39;t your self control yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.470" end="01:07:20.060" style="s2">well so it&#39;s like all of a sudden I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.720" end="01:07:22.070" style="s2">a wave and it&#39;s survival and my what I</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.060" end="01:07:25.430" style="s2">call it you know survival mode comes on</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.070" end="01:07:27.260" style="s2">and I&#39;m seeing everything but my body is</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.430" end="01:07:29.120" style="s2">moving to make it all happen to work</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.260" end="01:07:30.530" style="s2">because it wants to make it out and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.120" end="01:07:32.810" style="s2">like it&#39;s fully in control and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.530" end="01:07:35.390" style="s2">visualizing and seeing it and then I get</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.810" end="01:07:36.950" style="s2">back to the shore and I get back on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.390" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">beach and all of a sudden it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.950" end="01:07:41.690" style="s2">switch flips back over and all of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.960" end="01:07:44.150" style="s2">sudden I&#39;m just going like did I do that</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.690" end="01:07:46.730" style="s2">like I don&#39;t I couldn&#39;t tell you really</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.150" end="01:07:49.730" style="s2">I can imagine I can try to recall but</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.730" end="01:07:53.750" style="s2">like I don&#39;t really know what happened</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.730" end="01:07:56.210" style="s2">like like like I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll never be</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.750" end="01:08:00.110" style="s2">able to repeat that again with because</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.210" end="01:08:01.490" style="s2">well first of all each it&#39;s really weird</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.110" end="01:08:04.010" style="s2">that you have things that are highly</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.490" end="01:08:07.070" style="s2">regular and things like a bowling alley</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.010" end="01:08:09.980" style="s2">that those pins are always more or less</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.070" end="01:08:13.850" style="s2">the same and yeah the wave it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.980" end="01:08:15.560" style="s2">different why so I struggled for a while</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.850" end="01:08:17.930" style="s2">like when I it&#39;s not like I start big</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.560" end="01:08:19.150" style="s2">wave surfing and it was like I want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.930" end="01:08:22.640" style="s2">be able to sort of this it was like</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.150" end="01:08:24.500" style="s2">being a kid standing on the cliff going</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.640" end="01:08:25.370" style="s2">figuring out the wave from that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.500" end="01:08:27.020" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.370" end="01:08:28.100" style="s2">feeling like I knew it like the back of</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.020" end="01:08:30.410" style="s2">my head better than guys that were</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.100" end="01:08:32.299" style="s2">riding it all of a sudden I blinked I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.410" end="01:08:34.069" style="s2">down in the water and I&#39;m going oh my</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.299" end="01:08:36.460" style="s2">gosh how&#39;d this happened so fast I</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.069" end="01:08:39.380" style="s2">thought I had so much more time and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.460" end="01:08:41.600" style="s2">blink again and it&#39;s all since like I</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.380" end="01:08:43.790" style="s2">get myself into this mess you know like</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.600" end="01:08:45.109" style="s2">how did I get myself into the point</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.790" end="01:08:47.690" style="s2">where I feel like I&#39;m gonna die all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.109" end="01:08:49.730" style="s2">time you do it regularly why I used to</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.690" end="01:08:50.449" style="s2">when I first started it was like going</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.730" end="01:08:52.940" style="s2">oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.449" end="01:08:55.009" style="s2">and then you have like sponsors and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.940" end="01:08:56.809" style="s2">you have like boats and you have safety</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.009" end="01:08:58.819" style="s2">team and your people are on payroll it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.809" end="01:09:00.409" style="s2">expensive to surf big waves is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.819" end="01:09:02.269" style="s2">saying what am i right that you got</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.409" end="01:09:03.949" style="s2">yourself into trouble at some point when</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.269" end="01:09:06.139" style="s2">there was a helicopter that had been</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.949" end="01:09:07.670" style="s2">hired and you wanted to perform for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.139" end="01:09:09.650" style="s2">helicopter and you took on risk that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.670" end="01:09:13.569" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.650" end="01:09:16.309" style="s2">that&#39;s just that is a natural sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.569" end="01:09:17.690" style="s2">that&#39;s just natural to big wave surfing</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.309" end="01:09:19.190" style="s2">in general like you&#39;re gonna have to go</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.690" end="01:09:21.109" style="s2">through sir everyone goes through those</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.190" end="01:09:24.469" style="s2">types of situations if they&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.109" end="01:09:26.900" style="s2">to go to the level that they want or the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.469" end="01:09:29.809" style="s2">highest level the degree in which would</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.900" end="01:09:31.609" style="s2">be like a black belt or a like you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.809" end="01:09:34.699" style="s2">to go through that at one point there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.609" end="01:09:36.139" style="s2">just it&#39;s like someone telling you what</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.699" end="01:09:37.759" style="s2">to do and they have all this wealth of</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.139" end="01:09:39.170" style="s2">knowledge but until you go through the</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.759" end="01:09:40.969" style="s2">experience on your own you don&#39;t truly</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.170" end="01:09:42.979" style="s2">learn it for yourself you don&#39;t go like</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.969" end="01:09:45.170" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have the weight necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.979" end="01:09:46.789" style="s2">you can be told all you want but you</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.170" end="01:09:47.420" style="s2">almost have to experience it on your own</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.789" end="01:09:48.679" style="s2">accord</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.420" end="01:09:51.139" style="s2">well my right that this is so</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.679" end="01:09:54.049" style="s2">unpredictable that like you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.139" end="01:09:57.079" style="s2">I&#39;ve got this because anything can</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.049" end="01:09:59.780" style="s2">happen in a big wave absolutely um and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.079" end="01:10:03.139" style="s2">that yeah if I understand correctly your</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.780" end="01:10:06.979" style="s2">foot at some point had the surfboard</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.139" end="01:10:09.829" style="s2">come right at it and cleave it into oh</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.979" end="01:10:12.829" style="s2">yeah no that was like a classic example</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.829" end="01:10:14.900" style="s2">of like kind of going in to what you</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.829" end="01:10:19.099" style="s2">were saying it&#39;s it was probably my</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.900" end="01:10:23.360" style="s2">third full season surfing big waves the</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.099" end="01:10:25.699" style="s2">waves were giant and we were we hired a</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.360" end="01:10:27.559" style="s2">helicopter were filming and it was like</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.699" end="01:10:29.900" style="s2">I really want to get a shot for this</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.559" end="01:10:32.269" style="s2">movie that I&#39;m working on I really want</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.900" end="01:10:34.239" style="s2">to like have it blow people&#39;s minds you</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.269" end="01:10:37.010" style="s2">know there&#39;s that ego part ego is just</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:38.780" style="s2">the worst in big waves it&#39;s the best and</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.010" end="01:10:41.570" style="s2">the worst in a way because you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.780" end="01:10:43.639" style="s2">need an ego to like make yourself kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.570" end="01:10:46.999" style="s2">of prop yourself up to match power with</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.639" end="01:10:48.440" style="s2">power but am i right that you this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.999" end="01:10:50.260" style="s2">something I talk about and pisses people</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.440" end="01:10:54.260" style="s2">off like you wouldn&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.260" end="01:10:56.690" style="s2">the necessity of being both incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.260" end="01:10:58.519" style="s2">humble and an egomaniac and having the</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.690" end="01:11:02.630" style="s2">two of those selves fight each other</p>

<p begin="01:11:18.050" end="01:11:23.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a necessity towards it</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.970" end="01:11:25.100" style="s2">ego is okay there&#39;s certain situations</p>

<p begin="01:12:12.320" end="01:12:20.510" style="s2">exactly and it&#39;s you know I&#39;ve told a</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.290" end="01:12:22.310" style="s2">one thing that I remember when I was a</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.510" end="01:12:24.890" style="s2">really little kid being told all the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.310" end="01:12:27.290" style="s2">time was like don&#39;t no one likes a big</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.890" end="01:12:28.460" style="s2">head no one likes this and it beat there</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.290" end="01:12:30.800" style="s2">was like kind of beating into my head so</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.460" end="01:12:34.220" style="s2">much from Mike my mentors and certain</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.800" end="01:12:36.890" style="s2">people around me that it made me really</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.220" end="01:12:38.450" style="s2">shine reserved and felt like I fell I</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.890" end="01:12:41.030" style="s2">always felt like I could handle anything</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.450" end="01:12:43.910" style="s2">but I I don&#39;t think anyone else could</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.030" end="01:12:45.950" style="s2">like like if I said something that was</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.910" end="01:12:47.540" style="s2">maybe the truth or if I said somebody</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.950" end="01:12:50.750" style="s2">that was like something that was hard or</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.540" end="01:12:52.430" style="s2">very critical it would it would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.750" end="01:12:53.750" style="s2">damaging to someone and I never wanted</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.430" end="01:12:56.450" style="s2">to hurt anyone that&#39;s like the last</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.750" end="01:12:58.910" style="s2">thing I&#39;d ever want to do and so it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.450" end="01:13:03.830" style="s2">actually it&#39;s been a long process trying</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.910" end="01:13:06.740" style="s2">to overcome kind of that that habit of</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.830" end="01:13:10.220" style="s2">like giving your power away leaving the</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.740" end="01:13:12.410" style="s2">power away when in CERN it&#39;s okay to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.220" end="01:13:15.230" style="s2">like I think the the the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.410" end="01:13:16.530" style="s2">the best right the the best athletes</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.230" end="01:13:18.720" style="s2">that I&#39;ve ever met</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.530" end="01:13:22.620" style="s2">the true alphas they know how to switch</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.720" end="01:13:24.930" style="s2">it on and off like they they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.620" end="01:13:26.820" style="s2">able to be so humble and kind and they</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.930" end="01:13:29.010" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like they need to exert some</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.820" end="01:13:31.140" style="s2">but when the time comes for whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.010" end="01:13:33.240" style="s2">is that they do they can turn it on all</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.140" end="01:13:36.120" style="s2">of a sudden they&#39;re just these beasts</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.240" end="01:13:37.350" style="s2">these monsters that are a joke accept</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.120" end="01:13:40.110" style="s2">what it is that you are I&#39;m you know I</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.350" end="01:13:41.730" style="s2">let&#39;s be honest when I when I called you</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.110" end="01:13:44.250" style="s2">out there isn&#39;t another surfer on the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.730" end="01:13:46.710" style="s2">planet that I was dying to meet because</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.250" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">this is not I mean I&#39;m aware of who</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.710" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">Laird Hamilton is I&#39;m aware of Kelly</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:52.560" style="s2">Slater there tons of people like this</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:56.820" style="s2">guy Philip Toledo yeah I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.560" end="01:13:59.550" style="s2">watching all of these guys you were the</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.820" end="01:14:01.800" style="s2">only one from outside that I absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.550" end="01:14:03.570" style="s2">had to meet because of the level of</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.800" end="01:14:07.290" style="s2">innovation and then when I met you it</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.570" end="01:14:08.040" style="s2">was so disarming that you clearly know</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.290" end="01:14:11.430" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing something very</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.040" end="01:14:14.940" style="s2">different you can&#39;t actually deny it you</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.430" end="01:14:16.740" style="s2">can&#39;t fully embrace it either and so I</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.940" end="01:14:19.320" style="s2">think that one of the puzzles here is</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.740" end="01:14:21.660" style="s2">that we have to sort of pass power back</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.320" end="01:14:23.220" style="s2">and forth which is that you give your</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.660" end="01:14:25.260" style="s2">power away to some extent and then the</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.220" end="01:14:26.970" style="s2">community kind of with love just says</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.260" end="01:14:29.250" style="s2">you know no you really need to take this</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.970" end="01:14:32.790" style="s2">on because people are looking towards</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.250" end="01:14:35.640" style="s2">you and it&#39;s a very weird thing to sort</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.790" end="01:14:37.380" style="s2">of have to balance these things I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.640" end="01:14:39.810" style="s2">we do a terrible disservice when we tell</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.380" end="01:14:42.480" style="s2">people to get rid of their egos because</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.810" end="01:14:43.890" style="s2">that&#39;ll never work you have to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.480" end="01:14:48.270" style="s2">that the thing is like a Mexican</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.890" end="01:14:51.690" style="s2">standoff it you have to anything you</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.270" end="01:14:53.640" style="s2">have to face everything like if it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.690" end="01:14:55.050" style="s2">was telling my friend I had like a</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.640" end="01:14:58.260" style="s2">certain situation that I was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.050" end="01:15:02.040" style="s2">going through like maybe end of last</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.260" end="01:15:04.050" style="s2">year and it&#39;s like I told myself for</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.040" end="01:15:06.240" style="s2">this situation when I was a young kid</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.050" end="01:15:07.860" style="s2">like cuz I was pretty aware about like</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.240" end="01:15:10.140" style="s2">my pute the people around me and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.860" end="01:15:11.760" style="s2">mistakes they had made and how I was</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.140" end="01:15:13.560" style="s2">like I&#39;ve always I always when I was</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.760" end="01:15:16.920" style="s2">really young and when my ego is</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.560" end="01:15:18.900" style="s2">definitely very strong inside I was like</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.920" end="01:15:20.430" style="s2">I want to do everything perfect and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.900" end="01:15:22.080" style="s2">want to do it the best anyone&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.430" end="01:15:24.300" style="s2">done it I want to be the best ever</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.080" end="01:15:26.310" style="s2">because as a kid there&#39;s you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.300" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">to confront it yet you know but you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.310" end="01:15:29.970" style="s2">imagine you can believe you can do all</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.800" end="01:15:31.290" style="s2">these things because but you</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.970" end="01:15:33.990" style="s2">I actually have to go through it yet</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.290" end="01:15:35.610" style="s2">because you&#39;re still a little kid anyway</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.990" end="01:15:37.980" style="s2">so I told myself this one particular</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.610" end="01:15:39.090" style="s2">thing like I&#39;m gonna avoid this and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.980" end="01:15:41.790" style="s2">gonna and I&#39;m gonna make sure I never</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.090" end="01:15:43.650" style="s2">end up in the situation and inevitably</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.790" end="01:15:45.870" style="s2">the one thing that you try to avoid is</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.650" end="01:15:47.310" style="s2">the one thing that&#39;ll and eventually</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.870" end="01:15:49.590" style="s2">come for you you know you&#39;ll eventually</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.310" end="01:15:52.440" style="s2">meet it and I learned that that into the</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.800" end="01:18:23.369" style="s2">was the biggest surprise I&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.389" end="01:18:25.770" style="s2">in a movie because as a big wave surfer</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.369" end="01:18:29.309" style="s2">I was like it&#39;s so rideable and look you</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.770" end="01:18:32.059" style="s2">can do a Somali 400% man who&#39;s any big</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.309" end="01:18:34.770" style="s2">wave surf I don&#39;t know if any but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.059" end="01:18:37.500" style="s2">think about okay so in the movie the</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.770" end="01:18:39.780" style="s2">waves are created by gravitational</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.500" end="01:18:42.900" style="s2">forces right and and that&#39;s a lot like</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.780" end="01:18:44.579" style="s2">the moon helps pull our tides right but</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.900" end="01:18:47.460" style="s2">in the film here I&#39;m seeing a</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.579" end="01:18:50.460" style="s2">thousand-foot wave that&#39;s never breaking</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.460" end="01:18:53.099" style="s2">and it&#39;s continuous for for around the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.460" end="01:18:55.110" style="s2">entire world and I&#39;m like that seems</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.099" end="01:18:57.059" style="s2">like the sick you could ride a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.110" end="01:19:00.449" style="s2">full wave the biggest playground ever</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.059" end="01:19:02.190" style="s2">thank you football if you fall you just</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.449" end="01:19:04.320" style="s2">kind of cover the back and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.190" end="01:19:06.960" style="s2">another one and I mean the person the</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.320" end="01:19:08.039" style="s2">character dies because I can imagine if</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.960" end="01:19:09.599" style="s2">you&#39;re going over a thousand foot wave</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.039" end="01:19:11.520" style="s2">you get really high in the wave and it</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.599" end="01:19:14.039" style="s2">flicks you into the air and you fall a</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.520" end="01:19:16.050" style="s2">thousand feet and you die right or 200</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.039" end="01:19:17.460" style="s2">feet whatever it is because I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.050" end="01:19:19.739" style="s2">trying to I was always trying to imagine</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.460" end="01:19:21.030" style="s2">how the person died in that film because</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.739" end="01:19:23.039" style="s2">I had to leave them behind or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.030" end="01:19:24.599" style="s2">and I&#39;m like well the solution would</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.039" end="01:19:26.429" style="s2">have been right as you get to the top</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.599" end="01:19:28.559" style="s2">you just duck under the water and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.429" end="01:19:30.270" style="s2">stay the water kind of conceals you and</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.559" end="01:19:32.010" style="s2">you come back down the backside of it</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.270" end="01:19:34.020" style="s2">and then you can stick your head back up</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.010" end="01:19:36.000" style="s2">and get air or in that case you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.020" end="01:19:37.260" style="s2">wearing spacesuits perfect do you even</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.000" end="01:19:40.909" style="s2">have to like hold your breath underwater</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.260" end="01:19:43.139" style="s2">that&#39;s one one problem taken care of and</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.909" end="01:19:45.539" style="s2">and they&#39;re pressurized so you can just</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.139" end="01:19:48.300" style="s2">go through it but anyway I was just like</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.539" end="01:19:50.099" style="s2">that is like that would be that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.300" end="01:19:51.780" style="s2">and it made me actually start thinking</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.099" end="01:19:53.610" style="s2">like gosh I wonder if in my lifetime if</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.780" end="01:19:55.949" style="s2">space travel is really gonna be a thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.610" end="01:19:57.460" style="s2">and maybe someone goes to tighten or</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.949" end="01:20:00.969" style="s2">Europa like because the</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.460" end="01:20:02.890" style="s2">supposedly water some of us wait I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.969" end="01:20:05.890" style="s2">I&#39;m obsessed with the idea of surfing</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.890" end="01:20:07.660" style="s2">waves in this world yeah sure like if</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.890" end="01:20:09.520" style="s2">you have the right suit on I mean in any</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.660" end="01:20:11.650" style="s2">element you could probably go in unless</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.520" end="01:20:14.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like lava maybe I don&#39;t know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.650" end="01:20:16.630" style="s2">not that smart but what I do know is</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.170" end="01:20:18.790" style="s2">that just think of all the waves in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.630" end="01:20:21.969" style="s2">universe that is just firing right now</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.790" end="01:20:24.160" style="s2">and no one out and if we maybe we have</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.969" end="01:20:25.960" style="s2">the best waves in the universe but there</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.160" end="01:20:28.180" style="s2">has to be better ways I often look back</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.960" end="01:20:30.160" style="s2">in time just how do you think there</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.180" end="01:20:33.160" style="s2">aren&#39;t great undiscovered waves 100%</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.160" end="01:20:35.739" style="s2">where we on earth on earth do you think</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.160" end="01:20:37.900" style="s2">we&#39;ve mapped all the great waves no okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.739" end="01:20:40.210" style="s2">a great example is this wave NASA this</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.900" end="01:20:43.330" style="s2">is a great lead-in to Nezzer a Nazare</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.210" end="01:20:46.330" style="s2">let&#39;s discover nine years ago nine years</p>

<p begin="01:23:08.139" end="01:23:12.699" style="s2">believe it&#39;s an ancient it was once a</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.869" end="01:23:15.610" style="s2">glacier that carved out a huge valley</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.699" end="01:23:18.130" style="s2">and when all the ice caps melted it</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.610" end="01:23:21.519" style="s2">filled in the oceans and it covered that</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.130" end="01:23:24.159" style="s2">trench now the trench allows the swell</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.519" end="01:23:26.320" style="s2">this raw energy from the Atlantic to</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.159" end="01:23:26.769" style="s2">come in it gets sucked into that deep</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.320" end="01:23:29.230" style="s2">water</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.769" end="01:23:31.000" style="s2">it focuses it and it comes in and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.230" end="01:23:33.070" style="s2">this is where the wave comes in they</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.000" end="01:23:37.050" style="s2">call it pride they norte which is you</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.070" end="01:23:39.309" style="s2">know note the north&#39;s beach north point</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.050" end="01:23:41.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s where the wave breaks in</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.309" end="01:23:44.559" style="s2">nazaré and so what happens is all the</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.679" end="01:23:47.380" style="s2">swell comes in and then it all of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.559" end="01:23:49.510" style="s2">sudden gets accelerated onto shallow</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.380" end="01:23:51.519" style="s2">water so there&#39;s a point with a Ledge</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.510" end="01:23:54.099" style="s2">and it&#39;s all sand it&#39;s a giant beach and</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.519" end="01:23:57.280" style="s2">it comes in and then it focuses and what</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.099" end="01:23:59.050" style="s2">makes Nazeri so big is two peaks two</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.280" end="01:24:01.389" style="s2">waves and this is the concept of a rogue</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.050" end="01:24:03.909" style="s2">wave you know you can have a really big</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.389" end="01:24:05.280" style="s2">ocean of big waves and then it&#39;s one two</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.909" end="01:24:07.409" style="s2">big waves come together it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.280" end="01:24:10.780" style="s2">superposition it&#39;s the superposition</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.409" end="01:24:13.090" style="s2">yak-1 the swell comes in this way and it</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.780" end="01:24:15.070" style="s2">matches with another one and the energy</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.090" end="01:24:18.610" style="s2">combines and it doubles in height so it</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.070" end="01:24:20.230" style="s2">jacks up twice as high and it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.610" end="01:24:24.250" style="s2">perfect bottom for that perfect</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.230" end="01:24:25.570" style="s2">situation and it it produces the tallest</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.250" end="01:24:30.699" style="s2">waves in the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.570" end="01:24:32.709" style="s2">consistently and yeah that&#39;s nazaré</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.699" end="01:24:34.809" style="s2">nazaré is a trip you go there and it</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.709" end="01:24:37.629" style="s2">feels biblical I mean the word the word</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.809" end="01:24:40.599" style="s2">Nazare already sound like it&#39;s from you</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.629" end="01:24:42.959" style="s2">know the Old Testament and then add to</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.599" end="01:24:46.929" style="s2">this there was a guy there named Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.959" end="01:24:49.629" style="s2">that is stands up on the lighthouse and</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.929" end="01:24:52.269" style="s2">calls out sets if your tow surfing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.629" end="01:24:54.099" style="s2">like okay second set get out there you</p>

<p begin="01:24:58.619" end="01:25:02.800" style="s2">hilarious situation like so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.479" end="01:25:05.320" style="s2">out there often you&#39;re seeing this</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.800" end="01:25:06.909" style="s2">massive cliff 200-foot cliff and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.320" end="01:25:09.070" style="s2">seeing winds that are like half the size</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.909" end="01:25:11.139" style="s2">of it and on really big days the same</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.070" end="01:25:13.539" style="s2">size as the cliff because it gets that</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.139" end="01:25:15.219" style="s2">big we haven&#39;t seen it in the time that</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.539" end="01:25:16.959" style="s2">we&#39;ve surfed out there though you see</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.219" end="01:25:19.869" style="s2">this sort of castle lighthouse on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.959" end="01:25:21.729" style="s2">point spray in the air and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.869" end="01:25:24.939" style="s2">where am i right now I feel like I got</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.729" end="01:25:26.949" style="s2">thrown back in time and and this just</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.939" end="01:25:28.809" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel real and you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.949" end="01:25:31.689" style="s2">these towering mountains of water that</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.809" end="01:25:33.219" style="s2">look like interstellar looks the same</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.689" end="01:25:34.989" style="s2">it&#39;s just walls popping up everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.219" end="01:25:37.329" style="s2">and and it&#39;s not like there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.989" end="01:25:39.579" style="s2">breaking wave there&#39;s six breaking waves</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.329" end="01:25:41.769" style="s2">at once and there&#39;s no channel which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.579" end="01:25:43.149" style="s2">the channel is with a safe zone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.769" end="01:25:44.289" style="s2">where the deep water is and where it</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.149" end="01:25:46.179" style="s2">doesn&#39;t break it&#39;s kind of breaking</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.289" end="01:25:49.030" style="s2">everywhere it&#39;s a beach break it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.179" end="01:25:50.709" style="s2">world&#39;s biggest beach break it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.030" end="01:25:54.010" style="s2">one of the world&#39;s most terrifying big</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.709" end="01:25:55.780" style="s2">waves to challenge in that there is no</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.010" end="01:25:57.760" style="s2">safe zone when you&#39;re committed you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.780" end="01:25:59.619" style="s2">committed and I&#39;ve seen some disastrous</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.760" end="01:26:01.599" style="s2">rescue attempts on this thing oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.619" end="01:26:03.189" style="s2">great and every time I go there we lose</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.599" end="01:26:05.199" style="s2">a jetski at least once is that right</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.189" end="01:26:09.909" style="s2">luckily there&#39;s sand so pushes back up</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.199" end="01:26:12.159" style="s2">but imagine like everything around you</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.909" end="01:26:13.959" style="s2">was built bigger and all sudden you felt</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.159" end="01:26:15.699" style="s2">like your scale just went really down</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.959" end="01:26:17.260" style="s2">that&#39;s what it feels like there because</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.699" end="01:26:20.349" style="s2">the waves are so big all sudden you feel</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.260" end="01:26:22.570" style="s2">like really small the beach the beach is</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.349" end="01:26:24.729" style="s2">really steep and massive and large and</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.570" end="01:26:27.249" style="s2">you feel smaller on the beach the way</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.729" end="01:26:29.889" style="s2">the waves that move up and down it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.249" end="01:26:31.629" style="s2">travel 50 to 60 yards up the sand before</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.889" end="01:26:33.399" style="s2">it returns back to the ocean and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.629" end="01:26:35.709" style="s2">feel like this is what it feels like to</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.399" end="01:26:37.959" style="s2">be the size of a chihuahua do you get</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.709" end="01:26:39.040" style="s2">off on your own insignificance like your</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.959" end="01:26:41.080" style="s2">significance coming</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.040" end="01:26:44.290" style="s2">in significance there&#39;s no place on</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.080" end="01:26:47.440" style="s2">earth like like that place that wave to</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.290" end="01:26:50.010" style="s2">make me realize how small human being is</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.440" end="01:26:53.290" style="s2">definitely gotten used to feeling like</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.010" end="01:26:56.530" style="s2">insignificant and my place in this whole</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.290" end="01:26:58.330" style="s2">crazy world is not as important</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.530" end="01:27:00.130" style="s2">necessarily as I might want to think you</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.330" end="01:27:02.710" style="s2">know like because you look at these</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.130" end="01:27:05.710" style="s2">waves and they&#39;re just power this power</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.710" end="01:27:07.270" style="s2">and and you&#39;re trying to find kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.710" end="01:27:10.030" style="s2">like symmetry with it you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.270" end="01:27:13.420" style="s2">be one with it for just a brief moment</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.030" end="01:27:15.640" style="s2">and you just realize like it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.420" end="01:27:20.500" style="s2">place has been here forever for a long</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.640" end="01:27:22.420" style="s2">time and you know I guess if I can be</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.500" end="01:27:25.060" style="s2">just in line with something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.420" end="01:27:26.230" style="s2">bigger than myself that&#39;s what I thought</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.060" end="01:27:28.420" style="s2">what&#39;s me that&#39;s what makes me feel</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.230" end="01:27:30.160" style="s2">really good the best feeling I get from</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.420" end="01:27:31.780" style="s2">riding big waves is the drive home</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.160" end="01:27:35.290" style="s2">because you&#39;ve just went through this</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.780" end="01:27:37.150" style="s2">whole crazy experience your relief he</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.290" end="01:27:39.430" style="s2">relieved you just went through that and</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.150" end="01:27:40.540" style="s2">and and you you you tapped into</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.430" end="01:27:42.730" style="s2">something bigger than yourself</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.540" end="01:27:44.770" style="s2">physically bigger than yourself - well</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.730" end="01:27:47.290" style="s2">I&#39;m used to seeing you on some of these</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.770" end="01:27:50.170" style="s2">monster waves alone and then recently I</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.290" end="01:27:53.500" style="s2">saw you get a ride it looked like it</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.170" end="01:27:56.350" style="s2">jaws with a friend of yours yeah Nathan</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.500" end="01:28:00.760" style="s2">Florence and I thought what is it like</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.350" end="01:28:02.350" style="s2">to actually ride a wave like that with</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.760" end="01:28:05.290" style="s2">somebody that you know and care about</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.350" end="01:28:07.750" style="s2">does it feel totally different you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.290" end="01:28:10.660" style="s2">what it just there&#39;s camaraderie yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.750" end="01:28:13.450" style="s2">involved you still feel kind of alone</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.660" end="01:28:16.120" style="s2">because you on the board it&#39;s you on the</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.450" end="01:28:17.980" style="s2">board and it&#39;s your decisions that make</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.120" end="01:28:19.180" style="s2">the outcome and sometimes it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.980" end="01:28:21.340" style="s2">your decision that makes the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.180" end="01:28:23.260" style="s2">it&#39;s the waves that make the outcome you</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.340" end="01:28:25.000" style="s2">know like you could choose a wave and</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.260" end="01:28:26.710" style="s2">all of a sudden it it does something</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.000" end="01:28:28.750" style="s2">completely unforeseen and different</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.710" end="01:28:30.280" style="s2">riding that wave with Nathan we ended up</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.750" end="01:28:33.610" style="s2">getting really big barrel out of Jaws</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.280" end="01:28:35.950" style="s2">together and two for both of us to be in</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.610" end="01:28:38.170" style="s2">the barrel at the same time was amazing</p>

<p begin="01:28:59.210" end="01:29:05.690" style="s2">feeling you can translate the emotions</p>

<p begin="01:30:08.300" end="01:30:12.470" style="s2">effect coming up yeah there&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.400" end="01:30:14.570" style="s2">shift in women&#39;s big wave surfing and</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.470" end="01:30:18.530" style="s2">there was there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.570" end="01:30:21.200" style="s2">progression is until recently and now</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.530" end="01:30:24.650" style="s2">there&#39;s major strides the girls are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.200" end="01:30:27.980" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing how people like Keala</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.650" end="01:30:30.290" style="s2">has inspired the next generation enough</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.980" end="01:30:33.110" style="s2">to Alston step into that realm because</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.290" end="01:30:34.580" style="s2">for the longest time there were women</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.110" end="01:30:37.730" style="s2">that were writing big waves but not</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.580" end="01:30:39.140" style="s2">enough it wasn&#39;t inspired maybe I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.730" end="01:30:41.510" style="s2">want to take anything away from them but</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.140" end="01:30:44.030" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t inspiring the next of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.510" end="01:30:46.460" style="s2">youth or the next generation and along</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.030" end="01:30:50.540" style="s2">with Kayla and Paige alms</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.460" end="01:30:52.730" style="s2">Bianca Valente they these are like three</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.540" end="01:30:55.250" style="s2">of the top big wave female surfers yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.730" end="01:30:57.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve been Maya Gaby era who&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.250" end="01:31:00.290" style="s2">out at nazaré as well they&#39;ve inspired</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.680" end="01:31:02.030" style="s2">the next generation of big wave girls</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.290" end="01:31:05.780" style="s2">it&#39;s all since step into the realm in</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.030" end="01:31:09.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve always felt that it&#39;s it&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.780" end="01:31:11.000" style="s2">big ways sports in general die when</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.710" end="01:31:13.100" style="s2">there&#39;s not the next generation to take</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.000" end="01:31:17.000" style="s2">it to the next level like they cease to</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.100" end="01:31:19.810" style="s2">become relevant or even of interest and</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.000" end="01:31:24.110" style="s2">this is my own personal perspective</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.810" end="01:31:26.030" style="s2">because I feel like sports like action</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.110" end="01:31:29.780" style="s2">sports in particular surfing always</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.030" end="01:31:34.550" style="s2">needs to be constantly being pushed and</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.780" end="01:31:36.950" style="s2">so I I do I do see these young girls</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.550" end="01:31:39.200" style="s2">inspiring actually the older girls to</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.950" end="01:31:41.450" style="s2">continue pushing the envelope and when</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.200" end="01:31:44.750" style="s2">their time is up or they decide no</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.450" end="01:31:46.700" style="s2">longer to do it right that they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.750" end="01:31:49.010" style="s2">their fill that the next generation of</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.700" end="01:31:50.210" style="s2">girls take it to another level and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.010" end="01:31:52.970" style="s2">always felt the same way with me you</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.210" end="01:31:56.870" style="s2">know like I saw where Laird in all these</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.970" end="01:31:58.550" style="s2">legends took it and I wanted to take it</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.870" end="01:31:59.480" style="s2">from where they took it to somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.550" end="01:32:02.240" style="s2">else and I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.480" end="01:32:03.770" style="s2">take it but I hope in the future it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.240" end="01:32:06.260" style="s2">relay race you gotta hit it off to</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.770" end="01:32:09.500" style="s2">somebody else I hope in the future that</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.260" end="01:32:13.730" style="s2">I have the privilege of mentoring and</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.500" end="01:32:16.910" style="s2">helping that next generation you take it</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.730" end="01:32:19.850" style="s2">to a place that that that I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.910" end="01:32:21.260" style="s2">anymore because I got it to one position</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.850" end="01:32:23.270" style="s2">I just ran out of time well I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.260" end="01:32:26.000" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.270" end="01:32:27.980" style="s2">about breaking new ground versus what</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.000" end="01:32:31.280" style="s2">keeps us something relevant to the world</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.980" end="01:32:33.470" style="s2">so for example in jazz there was a</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.280" end="01:32:35.660" style="s2">period where the innovators were doing</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.470" end="01:32:38.090" style="s2">innovations that were appreciated by the</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.660" end="01:32:40.790" style="s2">listenership and at some point things</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.090" end="01:32:44.180" style="s2">get so technical that unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.790" end="01:32:46.820" style="s2">actually a performer eat well</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.180" end="01:32:50.060" style="s2">juggling is a good example the most</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.820" end="01:32:52.580" style="s2">technical jugglers in the world will</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.060" end="01:32:54.470" style="s2">point to one of one of their kind and</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.580" end="01:32:56.930" style="s2">say oh my god did you see what that guy</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.470" end="01:32:58.640" style="s2">did and to me you can&#39;t see I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.930" end="01:33:01.100" style="s2">it because it&#39;s already so many balls so</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.640" end="01:33:02.840" style="s2">many rings sure it&#39;s like the whole</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.100" end="01:33:04.340" style="s2">thing is so mind-blowing I can&#39;t slow it</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.840" end="01:33:06.920" style="s2">down enough to understand what the</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.340" end="01:33:08.570" style="s2">innovation was whereas at an earlier</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.920" end="01:33:09.830" style="s2">point and this is this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.570" end="01:33:13.040" style="s2">reasons why I think you&#39;re kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.830" end="01:33:15.590" style="s2">very romantic figure in this story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.040" end="01:33:18.080" style="s2">because I can see those innovations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.590" end="01:33:19.670" style="s2">not like so technical very often with</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.080" end="01:33:21.350" style="s2">some of the skateboarding stuff</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.670" end="01:33:23.150" style="s2">I have to slow it down a million times</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.350" end="01:33:27.410" style="s2">to even understand what the trick was</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.150" end="01:33:29.810" style="s2">yeah and I think that is that is really</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.410" end="01:33:32.210" style="s2">really true and and it touches on the</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.810" end="01:33:34.370" style="s2">point that we&#39;re still only scratching</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.210" end="01:33:37.730" style="s2">the surface of big-wave riding you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.370" end="01:33:40.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s such an act on its own but</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.730" end="01:33:44.120" style="s2">then adding sort of next level maneuvers</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.760" end="01:33:46.130" style="s2">and positions that one could ride at</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.120" end="01:33:48.320" style="s2">least what&#39;s nice about big waves is and</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.130" end="01:33:50.090" style="s2">I always say this is you have all you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.320" end="01:33:52.070" style="s2">all the time you need on a big wave</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.090" end="01:33:53.690" style="s2">small ways happen really quick yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.070" end="01:33:55.520" style="s2">things are like bam bam bam you have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.690" end="01:33:58.160" style="s2">be on it really quick and it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.520" end="01:34:01.310" style="s2">really fast and big waves I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.160" end="01:34:03.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a saying buy a big wave legend</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.310" end="01:34:05.120" style="s2">from Kauai on Hawaii his name was Titus</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.290" end="01:34:07.820" style="s2">kini maka and it was of Laird and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.120" end="01:34:10.400" style="s2">like he has the the quote goes like this</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.820" end="01:34:12.860" style="s2">he has the ability to slow himself down</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.400" end="01:34:15.830" style="s2">when everyone else wants to run like</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.860" end="01:34:17.630" style="s2">hell and it&#39;s not slowing down in terms</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.830" end="01:34:21.739" style="s2">of the speed of your board it&#39;s slowing</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.630" end="01:34:23.330" style="s2">down your mind it&#39;s like it&#39;s like and I</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.739" end="01:34:25.280" style="s2">work on this every single day I ride big</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.330" end="01:34:27.260" style="s2">waves it&#39;s like I have way more time</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.280" end="01:34:28.730" style="s2">than I think on this wave because when I</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.260" end="01:34:31.910" style="s2">watch the footage I realized wow I could</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.730" end="01:34:33.949" style="s2">have been this position and I could have</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.910" end="01:34:36.260" style="s2">waited longer or I could have done this</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.949" end="01:34:40.070" style="s2">like when I go to do a 360 don&#39;t rush</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.260" end="01:34:42.140" style="s2">the 360 let it move the way you you have</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.070" end="01:34:44.060" style="s2">to match the wave your but your mind</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.140" end="01:34:47.060" style="s2">master match the way well you just got</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.060" end="01:34:48.980" style="s2">to know I guess the time you have and a</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.060" end="01:34:50.719" style="s2">lot of people think a lot of people feel</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.980" end="01:34:52.160" style="s2">like they don&#39;t have the time so their</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.719" end="01:34:53.540" style="s2">mind starts racing and then all of a</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.160" end="01:34:55.040" style="s2">sudden the wave itself feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.540" end="01:34:57.350" style="s2">going really fast and everything is</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.040" end="01:34:59.000" style="s2">moving and it&#39;s how can you compute you</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.350" end="01:35:00.980" style="s2">know how can you keep everything like in</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.000" end="01:35:02.560" style="s2">line and then also when you try to slow</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.980" end="01:35:05.239" style="s2">yourself down a little bit just like</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.560" end="01:35:06.770" style="s2">even it&#39;s I just I would say it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.239" end="01:35:08.840" style="s2">when I sometimes ride a really big wave</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.770" end="01:35:14.630" style="s2">all almost just relax for a second and</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.840" end="01:35:16.760" style="s2">go okay let&#39;s continue that&#39;s so cool</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.630" end="01:35:18.350" style="s2">and then and then all of a sudden I see</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.760" end="01:35:21.199" style="s2">things and I&#39;m like oh I&#39;m gonna hit</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.350" end="01:35:22.820" style="s2">that okay here we come all right perfect</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.199" end="01:35:25.160" style="s2">all right here comes a parallel position</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.820" end="01:35:27.560" style="s2">all right I&#39;m in the tube and you calm</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.160" end="01:35:29.510" style="s2">yourself down and you and and I it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:41:29.120" end="01:41:34.460" style="s2">one way it&#39;s I would say really respect</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.240" end="01:41:36.080" style="s2">based but like Reunion Island and this</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.460" end="01:41:37.940" style="s2">is from a lot of my friends who were</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.080" end="01:41:41.270" style="s2">born and raised there and surf there is</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.940" end="01:41:44.450" style="s2">the biggest the the what they think is</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.270" end="01:41:47.720" style="s2">the biggest problem was when it became a</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.450" end="01:41:50.060" style="s2">nature reserve the moment reunion became</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.720" end="01:41:51.800" style="s2">a nature reserve the Sharks that would</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.060" end="01:41:54.170" style="s2">once the bull sharks that would migrate</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.800" end="01:41:56.150" style="s2">from Madagascar to Reunion all of a</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.170" end="01:41:57.590" style="s2">sudden decides to stay because here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.150" end="01:42:01.490" style="s2">abundant amount of fish well let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.590" end="01:42:04.730" style="s2">stay and so people forget that we are</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.490" end="01:42:07.460" style="s2">you know we altered our agreement well</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.730" end="01:42:08.890" style="s2">the agreement all of a sudden it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.460" end="01:42:12.800" style="s2">like giving the keys to the apartment</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.890" end="01:42:13.790" style="s2">but you&#39;re only a visitor and and and</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.800" end="01:42:15.920" style="s2">people forget</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.790" end="01:42:18.410" style="s2">I think people think we&#39;re not a part of</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.920" end="01:42:20.630" style="s2">the natural cycle of we think of</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.410" end="01:42:22.490" style="s2">ourselves too highly that we&#39;re not like</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.630" end="01:42:24.590" style="s2">a part of we become a part of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.490" end="01:42:26.450" style="s2">ecosystem by getting a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.590" end="01:42:29.510" style="s2">fish and of course I believe we should</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.450" end="01:42:31.370" style="s2">never over fish or do that but this is</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.510" end="01:42:34.700" style="s2">from this is like a real-life experiment</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.370" end="01:42:36.470" style="s2">from people that I know that grew up</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.700" end="01:42:38.900" style="s2">there that&#39;s like it used to be one of</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.470" end="01:42:41.030" style="s2">the premier surf destination especially</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.900" end="01:42:42.920" style="s2">for French surfers they&#39;d go there all</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.030" end="01:42:46.880" style="s2">the time because the French you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.920" end="01:42:48.230" style="s2">territory whatever it it all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.880" end="01:42:50.030" style="s2">as soon as we came a natural Nature</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.230" end="01:42:51.980" style="s2">Reserve the bull sharks came the bull</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.030" end="01:42:52.820" style="s2">sharks became territorial very</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.980" end="01:42:54.020" style="s2">territorial</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.820" end="01:42:57.800" style="s2">all of a sudden realized it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.020" end="01:43:00.170" style="s2">easy to fight and attack and feed on</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.800" end="01:43:02.780" style="s2">humans because we&#39;re pretty slow in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.170" end="01:43:04.910" style="s2">water compared to most of their prey and</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.780" end="01:43:07.250" style="s2">they became the dominant force in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.910" end="01:43:08.990" style="s2">water and and then there&#39;s this big</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.250" end="01:43:10.490" style="s2">argument now it&#39;s like well don&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.990" end="01:43:14.270" style="s2">the sharks and yeah of course don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.490" end="01:43:15.980" style="s2">sharks but we got to also like is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.270" end="01:43:18.110" style="s2">also asserting our dominance and our</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.980" end="01:43:21.080" style="s2">where we rank we&#39;re at the top of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.110" end="01:43:22.820" style="s2">food chain too and and it&#39;s all sand</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.080" end="01:43:25.130" style="s2">sharks learn from one another as well</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.820" end="01:43:26.870" style="s2">I&#39;m terrified that we have like this</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.130" end="01:43:29.540" style="s2">weird agreement with the orcas that we</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.870" end="01:43:31.940" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that orcas basically</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.540" end="01:43:33.800" style="s2">essentially never attack humans in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.940" end="01:43:36.950" style="s2">wild there&#39;s so ants there so I think</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.800" end="01:43:39.320" style="s2">orcas are so smart they realize there</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.950" end="01:43:40.790" style="s2">may be the ramifications of if I swear</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.320" end="01:43:42.860" style="s2">to God I think it&#39;s one of the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.790" end="01:43:44.960" style="s2">puzzles ever and I do have the sense</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.860" end="01:43:47.270" style="s2">that they&#39;re like we should not mess</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.960" end="01:43:50.060" style="s2">with these people it&#39;s like this is the</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.270" end="01:43:51.890" style="s2">one species we can take anybody in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.060" end="01:43:55.010" style="s2">water even the great whites leave these</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.890" end="01:43:58.250" style="s2">guys alone and of course you have local</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.010" end="01:44:00.170" style="s2">culture with Orca pods where they have</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.250" end="01:44:01.760" style="s2">entirely different styles of hunting and</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.170" end="01:44:04.220" style="s2">they pass information in ways that we</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.760" end="01:44:06.230" style="s2">have no idea about and so I think the</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.220" end="01:44:07.940" style="s2">fear too is that these bull sharks can</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.230" end="01:44:11.600" style="s2">eventually pass this information to</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.940" end="01:44:13.790" style="s2">other sharks and their offspring be it</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.600" end="01:44:16.340" style="s2">becomes part of their DNA that&#39;s like Oh</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.790" end="01:44:19.040" style="s2">humans are on the menu and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.340" end="01:44:20.960" style="s2">we&#39;re have not their DNA their cultural</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.040" end="01:44:23.840" style="s2">memes or whatever&#39;s they subtle means of</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.960" end="01:44:27.600" style="s2">transmission yeah yeah and and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.840" end="01:44:29.820" style="s2">I think it&#39;s it&#39;s controversial but</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.600" end="01:44:31.920" style="s2">I mean we at a certain point have to</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.820" end="01:44:34.350" style="s2">assert our own dominance in in certain</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.920" end="01:44:37.260" style="s2">ways if we want to take back Reunion</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.350" end="01:44:41.460" style="s2">damn it exactly right or or not leave it</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.260" end="01:44:43.320" style="s2">okay but but it&#39;s there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.460" end="01:44:45.570" style="s2">middle ground here you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.320" end="01:44:46.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like kids are getting eaten there</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.570" end="01:44:48.810" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.290" end="01:44:50.220" style="s2">they just want to go surfing and I knew</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.810" end="01:44:52.380" style="s2">that we get into this thing where we get</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.220" end="01:44:54.150" style="s2">into a reverential state about nature</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.380" end="01:44:55.740" style="s2">without realizing that we&#39;re part of it</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.150" end="01:44:57.770" style="s2">and we&#39;ve also break broken that you</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.740" end="01:45:00.120" style="s2">bought it it&#39;s a much more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.770" end="01:45:02.460" style="s2">relationship that we need and I think</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.120" end="01:45:04.500" style="s2">it&#39;s important everywhere it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.460" end="01:45:07.680" style="s2">same everywhere you know it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.500" end="01:45:09.180" style="s2">same like what happens here in</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.680" end="01:45:13.110" style="s2">California is not the same as in réunion</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.180" end="01:45:15.660" style="s2">you know I think we&#39;re not gods as well</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.110" end="01:45:18.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s like trying to like understand</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.660" end="01:45:20.370" style="s2">things is really difficult but it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.390" end="01:45:23.220" style="s2">think I want to say leave it up to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.370" end="01:45:25.550" style="s2">people yeah and leave it up to or leave</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.220" end="01:45:27.570" style="s2">it up to the people in those places and</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.550" end="01:45:30.330" style="s2">there&#39;s I don&#39;t think there should be</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.570" end="01:45:32.940" style="s2">any kind of backseat sort of driving</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.330" end="01:45:34.080" style="s2">from somewhere else because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.940" end="01:45:36.120" style="s2">different part of the world it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.080" end="01:45:39.390" style="s2">different ocean it&#39;s a different culture</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.120" end="01:45:42.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a different everything and let the</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.390" end="01:45:45.030" style="s2">tribes deal with those tribe things like</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.300" end="01:45:46.530" style="s2">we&#39;re not like everyone always argues</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.030" end="01:45:48.660" style="s2">like we don&#39;t want a police world well</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.530" end="01:45:50.100" style="s2">this is exactly a situation yeah we all</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.660" end="01:45:52.200" style="s2">have our own opinions on how it should</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.100" end="01:45:53.910" style="s2">be dealt with no one has a better</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.200" end="01:45:56.730" style="s2">opinion than the people who live there</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.910" end="01:45:59.490" style="s2">and understand certain things you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.730" end="01:46:02.310" style="s2">like I&#39;m just that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.490" end="01:46:04.350" style="s2">perspective on it I think however they</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.310" end="01:46:07.850" style="s2">see fit to take care of this situation</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.350" end="01:46:09.750" style="s2">is up to them and for me I live</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.850" end="01:46:14.550" style="s2">thousands and thousands of miles away</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.750" end="01:46:16.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not my decision so I have three</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.550" end="01:46:20.190" style="s2">destination questions to finish this off</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.920" end="01:46:21.810" style="s2">with I am obsessed with three islands in</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.190" end="01:46:24.000" style="s2">the middle of the Atlantic and I have no</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.810" end="01:46:27.570" style="s2">idea whether they have an importance in</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.000" end="01:46:31.140" style="s2">surf culture all right so we have this</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.570" end="01:46:33.690" style="s2">island ascension st. Helena and Tristan</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.140" end="01:46:35.130" style="s2">da Cunha do you know about this dude you</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.690" end="01:46:36.900" style="s2">can&#39;t tell you don&#39;t know these islands</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.130" end="01:46:40.620" style="s2">they&#39;re right in the middle between</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.900" end="01:46:42.480" style="s2">Africa and South America so Napoleon I</p>

<p begin="01:47:25.620" end="01:47:30.120" style="s2">time my friend of mine sent me a picture</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.990" end="01:47:32.100" style="s2">and in my quest to try to find the</p>

<p begin="01:47:32.100" end="01:47:36.720" style="s2">waves that I haven&#39;t been able to surf</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.690" end="01:47:40.350" style="s2">yet we were looking at a place like that</p>
