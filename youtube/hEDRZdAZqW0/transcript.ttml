<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.650" end="00:00:25.039" style="s2">Kord</p>

<p begin="00:00:25.039" end="00:00:30.110" style="s2">actually no it&#39;s zero percent right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.630" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t feel nervous anymore there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.110" end="00:00:40.489" style="s2">sort of like a mature boyish nobility</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:41.629" style="s2">sort of like on graduation day and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.489" end="00:00:43.489" style="s2">I just and I said that just really</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.629" end="00:00:45.309" style="s2">sinking to the moment feeling warm in</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.589" end="00:00:58.820" style="s2">matters most a nice edge of this moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.750" end="00:00:59.629" style="s2">and today we have Bonita Roy and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.820" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">just gonna hand the keys over to</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.880" end="00:01:22.390" style="s2">your hands</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:29.330" style="s2">okay so there are some new people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:29.330" style="s2">taking the risk that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.380" end="00:01:40.619" style="s2">so Peter has offered for me to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">quite a lot of these so I&#39;m hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.619" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">we can play around with something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:49.700" style="s2">we can build on over time but it you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">know stuff that would that would also</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.700" end="00:01:56.190" style="s2">hang by itself you know so this</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:58.470" style="s2">combination of doing one offs and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.190" end="00:02:00.750" style="s2">perhaps trying to build over time and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.470" end="00:02:05.640" style="s2">the one offs actually people could could</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.750" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">watch the recording so as I was telling</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.640" end="00:02:13.769" style="s2">Peter earlier you know he has so many</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:16.350" style="s2">great guests on this series and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.769" end="00:02:20.430" style="s2">always asking myself the question like</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.350" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t want to just contribute</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.430" end="00:02:28.290" style="s2">a lame version of Daniels Martin burger</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:31.950" style="s2">or lame version of Zach&#39;s dying you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">what these people are doing the top work</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.950" end="00:02:38.630" style="s2">and what they do so that means I have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">come up with something that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.630" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">orthogonal to this main conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">that&#39;s the part that makes Peter a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:54.510" style="s2">little nervous and so what I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.430" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">would do is share with you stuff at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.510" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">leading edge of my own thinking so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">it&#39;s half formed and it&#39;s offered for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">you as new minds you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:08.850" style="s2">tracking the types of minds young people</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:10.739" style="s2">have have changed over time I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.850" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">writing an article how the Anthropocene</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.739" end="00:03:16.829" style="s2">is changing our minds literally the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:20.100" style="s2">architecture of our minds and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.829" end="00:03:23.130" style="s2">noticing in my own courses that I give</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.100" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">is some of this very new work lands</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.130" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">intuitively for people and so then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:34.320" style="s2">it can be a tool or skill that you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:36.420" style="s2">play with going forward in the general</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.320" end="00:03:42.390" style="s2">category of sense making sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.420" end="00:03:43.550" style="s2">around these things so if you were here</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.390" end="00:03:48.120" style="s2">last week</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.550" end="00:03:52.230" style="s2">you got a flavor of what I call a modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.120" end="00:03:57.860" style="s2">minimalist approach to meditation or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.230" end="00:04:04.890" style="s2">some kind of a pasta this is a very big</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.860" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">design imperative in my work so you may</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.890" end="00:04:10.620" style="s2">have read some of my articles on</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:12.630" style="s2">releasing systemic complexity and so we</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.620" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">have this for a long time we&#39;ve had this</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.630" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">mind has grown you know taken our</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:19.560" style="s2">theories or issues and they make</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:21.269" style="s2">theories and they&#39;re meta theories and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.560" end="00:04:23.610" style="s2">systems of theories in meta you know we</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.269" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">have this way our mind has been working</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.610" end="00:04:31.320" style="s2">for a long time and now we have hyper</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:34.919" style="s2">objects and recently you will see a turn</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.320" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a turn to using our minds in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.919" end="00:04:41.790" style="s2">different way because there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:43.590" style="s2">impossible to act on a hyper object you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.790" end="00:04:45.740" style="s2">know it&#39;s in we&#39;ve gotten ourselves so</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.590" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">if we continue to use our minds in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.740" end="00:04:52.169" style="s2">what&#39;s called synthetic complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:57.140" style="s2">synthetic means ads and ads and ads and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.169" end="00:04:59.729" style="s2">ads hierarchical complexity that we get</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.140" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">increasingly complex thoughts with</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.729" end="00:05:07.050" style="s2">decreasing returns okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:08.820" style="s2">so my question is how you know not only</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.050" end="00:05:11.460" style="s2">I didn&#39;t approach it just like how can</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.820" end="00:05:14.540" style="s2">we use my our minds differently but can</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.460" end="00:05:17.550" style="s2">I can we look for cracks in that wall</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.540" end="00:05:19.910" style="s2">and we see them now I mean I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.550" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">writing about this for a long time but</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.910" end="00:05:28.440" style="s2">one of the things when you probably all</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:30.180" style="s2">are no Jordan halls deep code right or</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.440" end="00:05:31.740" style="s2">the way he writes about situational</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:34.530" style="s2">assessment it&#39;s a way to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.740" end="00:05:36.690" style="s2">cut through all this epistemic fat of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.530" end="00:05:39.630" style="s2">what&#39;s going on he would call it get rid</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.690" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">of the noise and get on signal right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.630" end="00:05:43.200" style="s2">this is one of the new minds this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:46.289" style="s2">like the characteristic of this new mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.200" end="00:05:49.230" style="s2">how can i how can I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.289" end="00:05:52.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a minimalist approach but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.230" end="00:05:55.580" style="s2">very tricky because we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.950" end="00:05:59.780" style="s2">reduce the complexity of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.580" end="00:06:03.480" style="s2">we want to preserve the holistic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.780" end="00:06:06.150" style="s2">integration the holistic complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.480" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">we want a minute we want to control our</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.150" end="00:06:14.220" style="s2">the potential of our minds to synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:18.330" style="s2">into hyper objects that we can&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.220" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">with so this is what I call a modern</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.330" end="00:06:25.350" style="s2">minimalist approach and I thought we</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:27.420" style="s2">would spend this session maybe a couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.350" end="00:06:30.150" style="s2">of sessions of trying to use our minds</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.420" end="00:06:32.730" style="s2">in this way now you see this in ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.150" end="00:06:35.820" style="s2">social life too I mean there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.730" end="00:06:38.070" style="s2">why people love Twitter it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.820" end="00:06:42.650" style="s2">opportunity to bottom-line what you want</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.070" end="00:06:45.240" style="s2">to say and for people who are used to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.650" end="00:06:47.490" style="s2">developing ideas through hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.240" end="00:06:49.110" style="s2">complexity they don&#39;t get it you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.490" end="00:06:51.060" style="s2">there&#39;s too much there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.110" end="00:06:54.030" style="s2">information on Twitter and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.060" end="00:06:56.250" style="s2">there&#39;s no one kind of collating it into</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.030" end="00:06:59.100" style="s2">like well then what is it you know so</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.250" end="00:07:01.890" style="s2">you see these these new minds even in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.100" end="00:07:03.960" style="s2">these kind of popular social things</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.890" end="00:07:08.810" style="s2">where people even people who aren&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.960" end="00:07:13.380" style="s2">necessarily geeky abstract thinkers that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.810" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">feeling of get to the heart of something</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.380" end="00:07:17.460" style="s2">in a hundred and sixty two characters or</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:25.860" style="s2">whatever it is this is this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.460" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">in our in our culture now and I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.860" end="00:07:28.620" style="s2">want to say them and then we&#39;ll we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:30.300" style="s2">Platt we&#39;re gonna practice we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.620" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">play with this but it requires quite a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.300" end="00:07:35.640" style="s2">lot of a little bit of framing I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:39.200" style="s2">want to say also if you saw the recent</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.640" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">rebel wisdom video</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.200" end="00:07:44.930" style="s2">and they have I&#39;m not going to remember</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:47.320" style="s2">his name they have Zach Stein and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.930" end="00:07:50.570" style="s2">they have this Canadian man who was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.320" end="00:07:54.200" style="s2">artist and he works with death</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.570" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">Stephen Jenkinson yeah now if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.200" end="00:07:59.060" style="s2">the way he speaks it obviously comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:02.120" style="s2">from like this way of an indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.060" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">thinker thanks you know these these</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.120" end="00:08:09.110" style="s2">these short powerful sentences so I want</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.250" end="00:08:11.420" style="s2">to say that there&#39;s something about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.110" end="00:08:14.570" style="s2">modern minimalist approach and deep cold</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.420" end="00:08:17.000" style="s2">with Jordan Hall that&#39;s actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.570" end="00:08:19.460" style="s2">a modern reflection of something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.000" end="00:08:22.970" style="s2">indigenous people did do I see them both</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.460" end="00:08:27.410" style="s2">somehow dancing in the same space so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.970" end="00:08:31.150" style="s2">way he speaks is very simple but</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.410" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">powerful right so I see these two</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.150" end="00:08:35.690" style="s2">actually just look for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:37.040" style="s2">yesterday when I heard him speak and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.690" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">was thinking about doing this with you</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.040" end="00:08:44.300" style="s2">guys I realized there&#39;s a like two sides</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:46.580" style="s2">of the clamshell there&#39;s something going</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.300" end="00:08:49.220" style="s2">on between it&#39;s a new mind but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.580" end="00:08:52.130" style="s2">got some of the characteristics of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.220" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">powerful ways that indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.130" end="00:08:58.060" style="s2">speak and I remember that happening to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:03.230" style="s2">me the first time I met Oren Lyons a</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.060" end="00:09:05.330" style="s2">conference in Yale and Andrew Cuomo was</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.230" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">there and the Kennedys were there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.330" end="00:09:10.700" style="s2">all these people were speaking one after</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:13.850" style="s2">another about environmentalists of iron</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.700" end="00:09:17.990" style="s2">mentalism in human rights this was years</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.850" end="00:09:20.090" style="s2">ago they were good you know there were</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.990" end="00:09:23.860" style="s2">really good speeches then Oren Lyons</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.090" end="00:09:23.860" style="s2">came up and he just</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.520" end="00:09:32.200" style="s2">just cut through so much what I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.280" end="00:09:34.990" style="s2">call epistemic fat you know he said</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.200" end="00:09:38.380" style="s2">you&#39;re talking as if if you live</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.990" end="00:09:43.060" style="s2">upstream from the toxic dump then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.380" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">okay and then he&#39;d say there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.060" end="00:09:47.380" style="s2">upstream honey we just let that sit for</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:51.070" style="s2">a while</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.380" end="00:09:56.340" style="s2">right so I think that this is a skill</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.070" end="00:09:58.450" style="s2">set that&#39;s very powerful that can really</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.340" end="00:10:00.370" style="s2">change the world it could change</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.450" end="00:10:08.620" style="s2">political discourse</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.370" end="00:10:12.400" style="s2">it could change yeah and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.620" end="00:10:13.810" style="s2">it&#39;s counter valence by let me say like</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.400" end="00:10:16.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a Daniel Chaumont and Berger</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.810" end="00:10:18.580" style="s2">approach which is not this Daniel smart</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.030" end="00:10:21.310" style="s2">book is a very integrative highly</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.580" end="00:10:24.420" style="s2">complex systems thinker I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.310" end="00:10:27.240" style="s2">a there&#39;s a beauty in a need for that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.420" end="00:10:29.740" style="s2">but I think this I just want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.240" end="00:10:32.220" style="s2">account juxtapose that to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.740" end="00:10:32.220" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.400" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">and someone in between is Charles</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.590" end="00:10:40.510" style="s2">Eisenstein you know he both says things</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:43.840" style="s2">that kind of cut to the chase but then</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.510" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of in in a situation where he</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.840" end="00:10:48.040" style="s2">feels to justify because he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:49.960" style="s2">such controversial things he feels to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.040" end="00:10:52.060" style="s2">the need to justify it by exciting</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.960" end="00:10:55.030" style="s2">science and a lot of factoids around it</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.060" end="00:10:59.350" style="s2">right so once you start to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.030" end="00:11:01.660" style="s2">kind of dynamics the cognitive dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.350" end="00:11:05.970" style="s2">of our collective you can see you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.660" end="00:11:05.970" style="s2">see these moving in in the inner space</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:11.580" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting I won&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:14.070" style="s2">forever we are gonna play but I just</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.580" end="00:11:17.220" style="s2">want to get you very interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.070" end="00:11:19.950" style="s2">this topic there&#39;s this book by David</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.220" end="00:11:21.870" style="s2">Chandler I have my thing on mirror so</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.950" end="00:11:25.500" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna be able to see it very</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.870" end="00:11:28.080" style="s2">well but it&#39;s called Anto politics in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.500" end="00:11:32.170" style="s2">the anthropic see</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.080" end="00:11:33.910" style="s2">this is the first published book let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.170" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">see when it was published he&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.910" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s out in 2018 he&#39;s out light</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:43.770" style="s2">lighting the same thing he says that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:46.750" style="s2">Anthropocene is changing our mind and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.770" end="00:11:55.800" style="s2">it&#39;s pushing it to three different ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.750" end="00:12:02.260" style="s2">and he calls it mapping sensing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.800" end="00:12:04.420" style="s2">hacking now I think the word sensing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.260" end="00:12:08.410" style="s2">problematic so I&#39;m gonna call it mapping</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.420" end="00:12:10.990" style="s2">tracking and hacking okay so just just</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.410" end="00:12:15.880" style="s2">use those three for how you remember</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.990" end="00:12:24.040" style="s2">this because you&#39;ll see why the word</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.880" end="00:12:25.510" style="s2">sensing is I think problematic so we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.040" end="00:12:26.650" style="s2">have these great archetypes in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.510" end="00:12:29.560" style="s2">space so I&#39;m just going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.650" end="00:12:33.610" style="s2">archetypes instead of getting conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.560" end="00:12:36.970" style="s2">here in this in this taxonomy Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.610" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">Sherman burgers a mapper you map all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.970" end="00:12:41.320" style="s2">relationships in the cat you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:43.510" style="s2">potential catastrophic let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.320" end="00:12:46.680" style="s2">Cascades and the trophic effects and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.510" end="00:12:50.500" style="s2">this he&#39;s a he&#39;s a brilliant mapper</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.680" end="00:12:52.960" style="s2">those of you who like to use mind map or</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.500" end="00:12:55.330" style="s2">I think Rome does this this is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.960" end="00:12:57.790" style="s2">impulse to map everything in all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.330" end="00:13:01.540" style="s2">relationships okay so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.790" end="00:13:02.950" style="s2">Anthropocene is pushing us to that one</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.540" end="00:13:04.510" style="s2">this is one response that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.950" end="00:13:07.450" style="s2">Anthropocene is pushing us to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.510" end="00:13:09.940" style="s2">different then having a complete theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.450" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">of everything because a complete theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.940" end="00:13:13.720" style="s2">of everything just says this and then it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:15.460" style="s2">makes it more complex and finally you</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.720" end="00:13:17.050" style="s2">have this meta theory on top of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.460" end="00:13:19.810" style="s2">everything that stands in for everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.050" end="00:13:21.730" style="s2">else mapping is just you kind of have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.810" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">travel you have to be a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.730" end="00:13:27.220" style="s2">traveller to deal with mapping does that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:30.670" style="s2">make sense do we need a question or</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.220" end="00:13:33.670" style="s2">clarification so mapping still has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.670" end="00:13:35.920" style="s2">of complexity but it doesn&#39;t just you</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.670" end="00:13:37.780" style="s2">know put like the meta theory that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.920" end="00:13:39.700" style="s2">stands in for everything yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.780" end="00:13:41.050" style="s2">actually have to have a mind that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.700" end="00:13:42.700" style="s2">you see</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.050" end="00:13:44.440" style="s2">Daniel doing this I mean it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.700" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">right he starts here and then it can go</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.440" end="00:13:48.610" style="s2">here and then you see well he could go</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:52.149" style="s2">here but he&#39;s gonna go here the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.610" end="00:13:56.140" style="s2">the mind has to journey in with</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.149" end="00:13:59.560" style="s2">conceptual territory in real time so</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.140" end="00:14:03.970" style="s2">this is a new mind and as I said I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.560" end="00:14:05.560" style="s2">very happy to see it published if I</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.970" end="00:14:07.980" style="s2">could write I could I would have really</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.560" end="00:14:11.589" style="s2">written it myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.980" end="00:14:15.310" style="s2">so that&#39;s mapping the prot so each one</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.589" end="00:14:17.079" style="s2">of these has benefits and problems and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.310" end="00:14:19.740" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to contextualize what</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.079" end="00:14:21.850" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do within this this this</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.740" end="00:14:24.310" style="s2">taxonomy so what we&#39;re doing is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.850" end="00:14:26.860" style="s2">mapping the problem of mapping is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.310" end="00:14:31.060" style="s2">there&#39;s if what he calls infinite causal</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.860" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">depth there&#39;s no end to what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.060" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">include</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.610" end="00:14:43.430" style="s2">and so this kind of exhausts itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:43.820" style="s2">eventually now does that make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.430" end="00:14:46.870" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.820" end="00:14:50.750" style="s2">infinite causal depth and you you know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.870" end="00:14:53.480" style="s2">have this this is very strong in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.750" end="00:14:55.310" style="s2">personality cuz when I hear Daniel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.480" end="00:15:00.350" style="s2">so beautiful and then I just fall into</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.310" end="00:15:01.970" style="s2">despair frankly that&#39;s like it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.350" end="00:15:03.740" style="s2">know and that&#39;s not true for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.970" end="00:15:05.420" style="s2">because you might have a mind that has</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.740" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">the energy to continue that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.420" end="00:15:12.010" style="s2">these are these are different minds but</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:15.200" style="s2">my mind is I&#39;m a lazy Taoist like things</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.010" end="00:15:18.170" style="s2">cut to the chase and this is more like</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.200" end="00:15:22.670" style="s2">just the chase so he calls the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.170" end="00:15:25.550" style="s2">causal depth now the second thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.670" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">happening in our society is what I call</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.550" end="00:15:34.760" style="s2">tracking he calls it sensing but what he</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:38.149" style="s2">means by tracking is oh so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.760" end="00:15:43.250" style="s2">things that&#39;s that is driving these</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.149" end="00:15:45.970" style="s2">three responses is that we are dealing</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.250" end="00:15:49.880" style="s2">with complexity that you can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.970" end="00:15:54.199" style="s2">characterize as if then if this then</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.880" end="00:15:54.500" style="s2">that so mapping doesn&#39;t say if this than</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.199" end="00:15:57.890" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.500" end="00:16:00.649" style="s2">you can enter the causal chain anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.890" end="00:16:04.180" style="s2">and and there&#39;s all kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.649" end="00:16:09.140" style="s2">can happen so this is the breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.180" end="00:16:10.970" style="s2">the if-then structure of mind prior to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.140" end="00:16:14.660" style="s2">three thousand years ago we we were</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.970" end="00:16:17.750" style="s2">unable to make if-then propositions then</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.660" end="00:16:20.829" style="s2">in axial age this new mind came we could</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.750" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">make if-then propositions if-then</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.829" end="00:16:26.810" style="s2">propositions build the upward path to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:30.290" style="s2">complexity now we can no longer the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.810" end="00:16:34.070" style="s2">questions we we ask are no longer can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.290" end="00:16:35.630" style="s2">put in if-then propositions so if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.070" end="00:16:37.190" style="s2">can&#39;t make it if they&#39;re in proposition</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.630" end="00:16:44.140" style="s2">you can&#39;t have a hypothesis you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.190" end="00:16:47.329" style="s2">have science this is not a postmodern ku</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.140" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">it&#39;s the nature of the evolution of the</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:57.810" style="s2">you&#39;re thought okay is that settling</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.980" end="00:17:00.060" style="s2">okay all right so one one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.810" end="00:17:02.460" style="s2">responses is mapping and one of is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.060" end="00:17:04.620" style="s2">called tracking and this is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.460" end="00:17:08.130" style="s2">mainstream response and what it is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.620" end="00:17:12.120" style="s2">that we are building AI systems that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.130" end="00:17:14.580" style="s2">know surveil and track everything but</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.120" end="00:17:19.970" style="s2">the theory is not that they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.580" end="00:17:22.970" style="s2">find if then if someone sneezes in</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.970" end="00:17:22.970" style="s2">Afghanistan</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:29.910" style="s2">Putin launches a nuclear missile right</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.790" end="00:17:33.300" style="s2">now they&#39;re not trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.910" end="00:17:35.250" style="s2">these complex causal change there</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.300" end="00:17:39.320" style="s2">they&#39;re working with computational</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.250" end="00:17:42.600" style="s2">statistics probabilities and correlation</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.320" end="00:17:47.970" style="s2">so what they&#39;re seeing for example is AI</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.600" end="00:17:50.580" style="s2">could see something like when pink comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.970" end="00:17:56.810" style="s2">in vogue in the fashion industry</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.580" end="00:18:00.900" style="s2">the Taliban tend to become more violent</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.810" end="00:18:02.790" style="s2">now if you had insight into why that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.900" end="00:18:05.550" style="s2">the case it might be because a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.790" end="00:18:07.860" style="s2">chemical that makes the pink goes on</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.550" end="00:18:10.050" style="s2">certain ships the shipping lanes are</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.860" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">owned by the Taliban the Taliban gets a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.050" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">heads-up they know that you know there</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">could be like all these reasons why but</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:23.490" style="s2">they&#39;re just using AI to find patterns</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:26.520" style="s2">that may or may not have causal links to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.490" end="00:18:29.250" style="s2">control and predict and to stabilize the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.520" end="00:18:31.020" style="s2">world as we know it these people want</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.250" end="00:18:35.820" style="s2">the world they have a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.020" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">control version of a homeostatic world</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.820" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">and he calls it sensing but you can see</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:46.590" style="s2">why I call it tracking so the book goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:51.450" style="s2">on and on it really talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.590" end="00:18:55.010" style="s2">sophisticated knot theory but this</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.450" end="00:18:58.260" style="s2">sophisticated yeah like theory or that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.010" end="00:19:01.610" style="s2">thought that backs this whole movement</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.260" end="00:19:03.670" style="s2">so there&#39;s a very big movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.610" end="00:19:03.670" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.830" end="00:19:11.580" style="s2">you feel this in you know the kovin</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.799" end="00:19:14.100" style="s2">response let&#39;s correlate surveil</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.580" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">movements and correlate there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.100" end="00:19:18.330" style="s2">this correlation correlate with</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:20.730" style="s2">pre-existing conditions correlate with</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.330" end="00:19:23.159" style="s2">this quarter with that it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.730" end="00:19:26.399" style="s2">it&#39;s not a measurement really it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.159" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">correlation that&#39;s so complex</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.399" end="00:19:37.230" style="s2">only a I can handle it should I look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">the chat maybe not okay so that one</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.230" end="00:19:42.630" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing but we have to honor</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:45.090" style="s2">that these two are in the space the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.630" end="00:19:48.210" style="s2">third one is called hacking and hacking</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.090" end="00:19:51.240" style="s2">is what we&#39;re going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.210" end="00:19:53.750" style="s2">it&#39;s relate it refers to what I call</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.240" end="00:20:00.779" style="s2">source code modern minimalist approach</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.750" end="00:20:05.309" style="s2">Jordan green halls deep code it and this</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.779" end="00:20:07.940" style="s2">is something that you see emerging today</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.309" end="00:20:12.779" style="s2">and they&#39;re pretty much experimental</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.940" end="00:20:14.490" style="s2">right so no ones that do it that&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.779" end="00:20:18.149" style="s2">deep code is pretending they have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.490" end="00:20:19.710" style="s2">theory that&#39;s more like a story but then</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.149" end="00:20:21.389" style="s2">there&#39;s key characteristics they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.710" end="00:20:23.549" style="s2">highlighting the deep code is there a</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.389" end="00:20:29.000" style="s2">code underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.549" end="00:20:36.649" style="s2">and so we are going to play around with</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.000" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">building some deep code today awesome</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.649" end="00:20:41.669" style="s2">that was supposed to be half at a time</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">but we so do we have any questions and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.669" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">before we do the exercises</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.940" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.680" end="00:20:58.290" style="s2">okay we&#39;re gonna start with something</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.310" end="00:21:02.970" style="s2">hopefully blow your mind and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.290" end="00:21:04.920" style="s2">weekend but that&#39;s the price someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.970" end="00:21:06.660" style="s2">said that perhaps explain shortly deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.920" end="00:21:10.920" style="s2">code okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.660" end="00:21:14.970" style="s2">so Jordan Hall uses the term deep code</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.920" end="00:21:18.210" style="s2">and what it is is I&#39;m going to you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.970" end="00:21:20.160" style="s2">try to language it for him if you see if</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.210" end="00:21:22.680" style="s2">you watch his deep code videos he has</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.160" end="00:21:25.800" style="s2">like 22 I think deep code videos on</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.680" end="00:21:29.420" style="s2">YouTube that has a rapid succession and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.800" end="00:21:34.110" style="s2">what he&#39;s trying to do is name the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.420" end="00:21:36.570" style="s2">significant so sovereignty came out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.110" end="00:21:39.150" style="s2">his deep code analysis he would say what</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.570" end="00:21:41.370" style="s2">we need is sovereignty and sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.150" end="00:21:46.200" style="s2">he has to do with sensing so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.370" end="00:21:48.600" style="s2">building up protocols for what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.200" end="00:21:52.110" style="s2">sovereignty and he&#39;s saying this is deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.600" end="00:21:54.540" style="s2">cold for being a human being right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.110" end="00:21:57.810" style="s2">not a theory and it&#39;s not just a story</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.540" end="00:22:02.840" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to tap into some intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.810" end="00:22:02.840" style="s2">knowing that this is this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.500" end="00:22:07.370" style="s2">what being a human is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.190" end="00:22:16.210" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna play with one if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.830" end="00:22:18.310" style="s2">get it to today we&#39;ll play with one if</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.210" end="00:22:21.100" style="s2">you if you read if you know if you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.310" end="00:22:23.290" style="s2">you can listen to my podcast son emerge</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.100" end="00:22:25.390" style="s2">anchor emerge with Daniel Thorson and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.290" end="00:22:28.060" style="s2">talked about source code analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.390" end="00:22:30.210" style="s2">trust power and collective action we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.060" end="00:22:33.760" style="s2">gonna actually do that here together so</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.210" end="00:22:37.870" style="s2">it may or may not be useful to to watch</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.760" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">that but the notion of sovereignty as</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.870" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">deep code like what are we doing or when</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:46.210" style="s2">he when he when he he&#39;s really good at</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">looking at complex situation he&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.210" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">then he says signal-to-noise people so</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:55.000" style="s2">just by that little code like their</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:22:57.730" style="s2">signal and noise going it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.000" end="00:22:59.710" style="s2">very effective way to cut out a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.730" end="00:23:08.110" style="s2">complexity without reducing it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.710" end="00:23:12.430" style="s2">lose the complexity but you you you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.110" end="00:23:16.150" style="s2">a new perspective on it if he says in in</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.430" end="00:23:18.730" style="s2">all this confusion all this this fake</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.150" end="00:23:21.820" style="s2">news and propaganda information there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.730" end="00:23:23.920" style="s2">signal and there&#39;s noise people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.820" end="00:23:26.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s that&#39;s a deep code</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.920" end="00:23:31.750" style="s2">underneath the information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.550" end="00:23:36.850" style="s2">what&#39;s that helpful a little been</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.750" end="00:23:39.400" style="s2">helpful yeah yeah it&#39;s different than</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.850" end="00:23:41.110" style="s2">then like trying to analyze everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.400" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">that&#39;s going on in information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.110" end="00:23:47.680" style="s2">he&#39;s just using a it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:49.780" style="s2">pointing out instruction you know you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.680" end="00:23:52.330" style="s2">you will see that deep code and source</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.780" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">code they have to do with sensing your</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.330" end="00:23:56.740" style="s2">your body and your intuition is always a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:58.930" style="s2">part of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.740" end="00:24:01.090" style="s2">I call it source code because deep code</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.930" end="00:24:03.940" style="s2">you know it sounds very paranoia</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.090" end="00:24:05.950" style="s2">conspiratorial but okay so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.940" end="00:24:08.610" style="s2">do with this one&#39;s a fun one because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.950" end="00:24:14.550" style="s2">want to build up like our ability to to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.610" end="00:24:17.320" style="s2">to play with with source codes our</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.550" end="00:24:20.590" style="s2">source code so what we&#39;re going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.320" end="00:24:22.570" style="s2">we&#39;re going to take on a simple</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.590" end="00:24:25.210" style="s2">exercise first we&#39;re going to find the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.570" end="00:24:28.450" style="s2">the source code of the existence of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.210" end="00:24:38.590" style="s2">universe so we start with something very</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.450" end="00:24:42.340" style="s2">simple yeah so the idea is I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.590" end="00:24:44.770" style="s2">to I don&#39;t want to download this so to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.340" end="00:24:47.500" style="s2">be good participants you just have to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.770" end="00:24:49.570" style="s2">willing to say what comes up even if</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.500" end="00:24:51.429" style="s2">it&#39;s you know you really at this point</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.570" end="00:24:54.580" style="s2">you have no idea where I&#39;m going with</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.429" end="00:24:58.600" style="s2">this so we can build on it together so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.580" end="00:25:01.029" style="s2">what do I mean by the source code we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.600" end="00:25:03.809" style="s2">going to parse the source code of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.029" end="00:25:06.820" style="s2">universe well I obviously I don&#39;t mean a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.809" end="00:25:10.120" style="s2">unified field theory because that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.820" end="00:25:15.340" style="s2">of this big synthetic thing and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.120" end="00:25:19.059" style="s2">mean mind mapping I&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.340" end="00:25:22.269" style="s2">what is the most minimalist set of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.059" end="00:25:26.249" style="s2">requirements I need</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.269" end="00:25:26.249" style="s2">that are necessary and sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.850" end="00:25:32.029" style="s2">to generate everything the universe as</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:36.619" style="s2">we know it</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.029" end="00:25:40.809" style="s2">what is the minimal set of requirements</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.619" end="00:25:43.809" style="s2">I call them protocols that can generate</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.809" end="00:25:43.809" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.280" end="00:25:49.150" style="s2">that we experienced and know everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.650" end="00:25:51.540" style="s2">we know and experience about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.150" end="00:25:51.540" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.049" end="00:25:59.159" style="s2">so it sounds like a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.510" end="00:26:20.930" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually a very easy problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.810" end="00:26:25.340" style="s2">once you get the hang of this so you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.930" end="00:26:27.500" style="s2">might say well you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.340" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">justify whether why there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.500" end="00:26:31.580" style="s2">and not nothing right I mean that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:36.380" style="s2">thing you could say it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.580" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">fundamental we have to justify that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.380" end="00:26:40.820" style="s2">there is self-reflective consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:43.640" style="s2">even if I don&#39;t believe any of you exist</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.820" end="00:26:50.450" style="s2">I know that I have self reflective</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.640" end="00:26:55.270" style="s2">consciousness so these are the these are</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.450" end="00:27:04.340" style="s2">some of the basic things that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.270" end="00:27:07.010" style="s2">protocols have to code for has anyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.340" end="00:27:13.370" style="s2">has anyone ever thought of this in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.010" end="00:27:15.170" style="s2">way and come up with something I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.370" end="00:27:17.390" style="s2">this different from science where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.170" end="00:27:19.810" style="s2">have second law of thermodynamics or</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.390" end="00:27:22.700" style="s2">evolutionary theory of fittest or</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.810" end="00:27:26.510" style="s2">adaptation it&#39;s essentially what leads</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.700" end="00:27:30.800" style="s2">to the whole system emerging anyways</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.510" end="00:27:33.260" style="s2">right because it&#39;s it&#39;s simpler and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.800" end="00:27:35.540" style="s2">deeper than that in other words I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.260" end="00:27:42.110" style="s2">going to what we&#39;re going to come up</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.540" end="00:27:43.460" style="s2">with you&#39;ll see that for example one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.110" end="00:27:48.170" style="s2">the things we&#39;re going to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.460" end="00:27:51.430" style="s2">is the notion of asymmetry and this of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.170" end="00:27:55.790" style="s2">course is a fundamental notion in</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.430" end="00:28:01.480" style="s2">thermodynamics right so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.790" end="00:28:06.590" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s deeper then it&#39;s deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.480" end="00:28:10.490" style="s2">those those things so I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.590" end="00:28:13.580" style="s2">give it to you but but I think huh oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.490" end="00:28:16.760" style="s2">yeah please good</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.580" end="00:28:18.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t know if you were asking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.760" end="00:28:23.270" style="s2">reminding of something like forest stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.910" end="00:28:25.400" style="s2">something around interaction ah okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.270" end="00:28:30.830" style="s2">that&#39;s this one yeah so we&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.400" end="00:28:35.470" style="s2">interaction down go ahead Oh try to pull</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.830" end="00:28:39.710" style="s2">them for stuff so there it&#39;s not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.470" end="00:28:47.300" style="s2">some sort of relation now yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.710" end="00:28:50.420" style="s2">gonna put that with interaction okay and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.300" end="00:29:02.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a notion of symmetry a symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.420" end="00:29:04.760" style="s2">continuity and discontinuity yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.570" end="00:29:10.210" style="s2">that&#39;s in the right direction you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.760" end="00:29:15.550" style="s2">this sense of what kind of mind is</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.210" end="00:29:15.550" style="s2">asking from this this a new mind right</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.030" end="00:29:22.100" style="s2">so what&#39;s coming alive for me juanita</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.580" end="00:29:27.070" style="s2">when you were talking is what wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.100" end="00:29:27.070" style="s2">be said was trusting without a guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.060" end="00:29:38.390" style="s2">you know I&#39;m going to that that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.380" end="00:29:43.850" style="s2">writing it down because there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.390" end="00:29:46.340" style="s2">something that is implicated in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.850" end="00:29:48.260" style="s2">protocols it&#39;s very similar to that so</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.340" end="00:29:52.700" style="s2">this is really cool that&#39;s a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.260" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">intuition so I have something it might</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.700" end="00:29:58.730" style="s2">not be useful but I had a vision at a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:01.700" style="s2">certain point of what was underneath</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.730" end="00:30:04.970" style="s2">everything and it was a relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.700" end="00:30:11.930" style="s2">shapes and forms and things was</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.970" end="00:30:14.210" style="s2">patterned and related perfectly yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.930" end="00:30:19.060" style="s2">that&#39;s very platonic right shapes and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.210" end="00:30:22.100" style="s2">forms so where we need are fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.060" end="00:30:24.050" style="s2">it&#39;s not a theory okay it doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.100" end="00:30:26.060" style="s2">anything about causal it&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.050" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">protocols that are necessary but</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.060" end="00:30:28.429" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:30.169" style="s2">and what you&#39;re saying is those</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.429" end="00:30:32.260" style="s2">protocols have to account for the fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.169" end="00:30:35.720" style="s2">that there are shapes and forms and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.260" end="00:30:39.409" style="s2">essences and all these things different</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:41.450" style="s2">ways of cosmology or metaphysics we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.409" end="00:30:46.850" style="s2">to we have to have the conditions need</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.450" end="00:30:49.580" style="s2">to provide for that to happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.850" end="00:30:54.470" style="s2">coming to mind for me is positive and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.580" end="00:30:59.090" style="s2">negative charges and there being a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.470" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">fundamental thing that allow all further</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.090" end="00:31:05.389" style="s2">interaction yeah and that will come with</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">the notion asymmetry is the word that</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.389" end="00:31:12.830" style="s2">categorizes all of that so the word</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:15.830" style="s2">asymmetry is deeper protocol but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.830" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">the simplest way I can account for for</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.830" end="00:31:23.090" style="s2">all of that word that came up for me</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:26.630" style="s2">seems to vague for what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.090" end="00:31:31.850" style="s2">about but consciousness yes so we we</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.630" end="00:31:34.570" style="s2">need we need obviously our protocols to</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.850" end="00:31:40.730" style="s2">set the conditions that conscious beings</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.570" end="00:31:43.010" style="s2">are are happening at least one conscious</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.730" end="00:31:45.139" style="s2">reflective being you know I can doubt I</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.010" end="00:31:47.299" style="s2">can be Descartes and down the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.139" end="00:31:48.679" style="s2">you who are just pixels on my screen and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.299" end="00:31:55.630" style="s2">I&#39;m caught in some kind of simulation</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.679" end="00:31:55.630" style="s2">but yes get gen say more about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.539" end="00:32:05.419" style="s2">hmm so differentiation is where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.259" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">know if I can explain it I can feel it</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.419" end="00:32:12.079" style="s2">yes no it&#39;s actually things for some</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:15.199" style="s2">reason are different and we find those</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.079" end="00:32:16.699" style="s2">we can pull stuff apart and say this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.199" end="00:32:22.570" style="s2">like that and that&#39;s a bit different and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.699" end="00:32:26.899" style="s2">I haven&#39;t got words for it no but that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.570" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">differentiation is is is one we only</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.899" end="00:32:32.469" style="s2">need three actually protocols</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:32.469" style="s2">differentiation is is one of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.029" end="00:32:46.849" style="s2">there&#39;s something like just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.649" end="00:32:50.869" style="s2">there is something about like leap a</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.849" end="00:32:54.139" style="s2">leaping or maybe creativity imagination</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.869" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">but something not so mundane but</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.139" end="00:33:00.289" style="s2">something that has like absolute not</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:06.139" style="s2">nothing ahead of it and leaping into an</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.289" end="00:33:08.449" style="s2">owner yeah wise we&#39;re stuck in what this</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.139" end="00:33:14.959" style="s2">kind of what is sort of thing and how do</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.449" end="00:33:18.639" style="s2">we yeah yeah okay I&#39;m going to tie that</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.959" end="00:33:21.109" style="s2">into trusting without guaranteeing</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.639" end="00:33:24.339" style="s2">because the leap factors in both</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.109" end="00:33:28.099" style="s2">directions in the past in the forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.339" end="00:33:35.119" style="s2">yeah so this is this is very good work</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.099" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">this is like into intuition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.119" end="00:33:37.669" style="s2">actually we&#39;re doing metaphysics that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:39.769" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.669" end="00:33:42.379" style="s2">forest works come in you guys are all</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.769" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">doing metaphysics it&#39;s easier than you</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.379" end="00:33:51.979" style="s2">thought its metaphysics without the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:54.469" style="s2">epistemic fat so there&#39;s there something</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.979" end="00:33:57.069" style="s2">about about just movement in general</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.469" end="00:33:59.540" style="s2">like things don&#39;t stay the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.069" end="00:34:03.110" style="s2">there&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.540" end="00:34:03.670" style="s2">so that&#39;s our first proposition who said</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.110" end="00:34:10.130" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.670" end="00:34:11.659" style="s2">Donna okay yeah so I&#39;ve done this many</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.130" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">times and you always have to start</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.659" end="00:34:19.510" style="s2">somewhere it could be a placeholder but</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:22.510" style="s2">there has to be movement or process or</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.510" end="00:34:22.510" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.630" end="00:34:31.950" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first condition it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.220" end="00:34:34.920" style="s2">a process or a movement or the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.950" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">to move or to change or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.920" end="00:34:39.930" style="s2">it&#39;s more like a you know we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:42.540" style="s2">have a place holder you could say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.930" end="00:34:45.000" style="s2">the void that has within it the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.540" end="00:34:46.920" style="s2">potential for these the potentials of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.000" end="00:34:49.470" style="s2">the void so they&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.920" end="00:34:53.790" style="s2">happening so you could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.470" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">potential anything whatever you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.790" end="00:35:03.410" style="s2">we have to start with that the movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:03.410" style="s2">the move to change the process</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.820" end="00:35:15.870" style="s2">yeah so this is something with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.310" end="00:35:17.370" style="s2">axiomatic we have to it doesn&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.870" end="00:35:19.590" style="s2">it comes from our language and part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.370" end="00:35:22.890" style="s2">it is because we have to get started so</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.590" end="00:35:30.860" style="s2">that&#39;s axiomatic to this now there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.890" end="00:35:30.860" style="s2">others if we had movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.990" end="00:35:35.090" style="s2">and something was just moving</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.130" end="00:35:44.040" style="s2">would we necessarily have many different</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.790" end="00:35:44.040" style="s2">things that can relate to each other</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.660" end="00:35:56.310" style="s2">if it was just a wave the second one be</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.670" end="00:35:59.780" style="s2">differentiation and then yeah relative</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.310" end="00:36:02.300" style="s2">relative it has to be a self</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.780" end="00:36:05.270" style="s2">differentiating</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.300" end="00:36:09.310" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.270" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s where the asymmetry comes in</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.310" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">you guys are like metaphysics people</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.750" end="00:36:24.850" style="s2">yes so that&#39;s that&#39;s the obvious next</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.600" end="00:36:27.690" style="s2">step if the wave didn&#39;t self</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.850" end="00:36:27.690" style="s2">differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.730" end="00:36:35.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not adequate you need self</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.380" end="00:36:37.390" style="s2">differentiation and then what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.090" end="00:36:37.390" style="s2">third one</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.250" end="00:36:51.859" style="s2">is it just complexification no a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:53.539" style="s2">- that&#39;s a little too ahead of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.859" end="00:36:56.539" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;ve already said it if I</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.539" end="00:36:59.930" style="s2">have something here&#39;s the wave and now</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.539" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s done self differentiating what else</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.930" end="00:37:06.030" style="s2">do I need</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:08.700" style="s2">for consciousness interaction yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.030" end="00:37:11.220" style="s2">interaction the self differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.700" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">parts need to interact in order to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.220" end="00:37:17.220" style="s2">produce everything else we have so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:19.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the interaction relationality or</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.220" end="00:37:22.890" style="s2">else we would never have we would never</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.380" end="00:37:24.299" style="s2">know ourselves right the wave even</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.890" end="00:37:26.430" style="s2">though it&#39;s self differentiated would</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.299" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">never know itself you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.430" end="00:37:34.559" style="s2">interaction so interaction or what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:36.780" style="s2">call participation so do you understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.559" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">now what deep code is this is like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.780" end="00:37:44.690" style="s2">fundamental protocols that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:44.690" style="s2">generate everything we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.940" end="00:37:50.500" style="s2">now it&#39;s fractal you&#39;ll see these same</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.069" end="00:37:53.010" style="s2">three everywhere you look because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.500" end="00:37:53.010" style="s2">deep code</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.220" end="00:38:00.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.580" end="00:38:09.190" style="s2">now one of the things that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.480" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">interesting and these came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.190" end="00:38:14.210" style="s2">leap and the trusting without a</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:19.000" style="s2">guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.210" end="00:38:19.000" style="s2">is there something</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.109" end="00:38:26.510" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.450" end="00:38:26.510" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.050" end="00:38:32.080" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try it Peter I&#39;m going in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.650" end="00:38:42.750" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.690" end="00:38:42.750" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:48.220" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">you have to enable participants screen</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:08.250" style="s2">sharing because they&#39;re not them on this</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.520" end="00:39:08.250" style="s2">one I&#39;m not the okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.450" end="00:39:20.530" style="s2">there you go thank you very much okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.840" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">welcome to the corona a century where we</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.530" end="00:39:33.130" style="s2">need to do these things like this so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">you have something like process and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.130" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">the process self differentiates</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.240" end="00:39:45.220" style="s2">and we already know like that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.430" end="00:39:51.010" style="s2">not adequate you could imagine many</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.220" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">worlds that exist where there&#39;s process</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.010" end="00:39:55.870" style="s2">fields that fail to self differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:58.500" style="s2">and they could be out there it could be</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.870" end="00:40:02.110" style="s2">what for example dark energy is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.500" end="00:40:05.830" style="s2">you could have process fields where the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.110" end="00:40:07.930" style="s2">energy is self differentiating but</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.830" end="00:40:10.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have participation so it</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.930" end="00:40:13.840" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t build a whole world right maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.810" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what string theory is you go on</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.840" end="00:40:19.060" style="s2">and on and on but it doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:22.150" style="s2">necessarily have to have all this</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.060" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">complexity there may be quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.150" end="00:40:27.130" style="s2">worlds where you don&#39;t have adequate</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:32.170" style="s2">complexity to build the world we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.130" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">right does that make sense yeah now so</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.170" end="00:40:40.650" style="s2">then these guys whoops</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:40.650" style="s2">these guys participate</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.670" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">this is where some are called</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.260" end="00:40:48.670" style="s2">complexification and that&#39;s and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:51.190" style="s2">actually self-organized new forms right</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.670" end="00:40:53.410" style="s2">so they can self-organize new forms you</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.190" end="00:40:58.109" style="s2">can do all kinds of things with this but</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.410" end="00:40:58.109" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.579" end="00:41:04.900" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.319" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">worlds that we can build from this and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.900" end="00:41:11.769" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to choose one over the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:17.609" style="s2">other but there&#39;s a chance that so if</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.769" end="00:41:20.769" style="s2">you if you think of buddhist yogacara</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.609" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">spirituality this very close to their</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.769" end="00:41:31.279" style="s2">cosmology and this lower this level here</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:33.339" style="s2">is called the storehouse consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.279" end="00:41:33.339" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.410" end="00:41:42.110" style="s2">they argue storehouse</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.290" end="00:41:44.090" style="s2">consciousness they argue when you go</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.110" end="00:41:46.400" style="s2">into deep dreamless sleep you always</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.090" end="00:41:48.590" style="s2">deep dip into here this is where karmic</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.400" end="00:41:50.810" style="s2">imprints happening where collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.590" end="00:41:53.900" style="s2">karma happens and stuff like that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.810" end="00:41:56.900" style="s2">it&#39;s why you can be reborn because</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.900" end="00:41:58.520" style="s2">they&#39;re seeds of your previous life gets</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.900" end="00:42:01.100" style="s2">stored in here and then you&#39;re reborn</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.520" end="00:42:02.980" style="s2">with some information from a previous</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.100" end="00:42:11.870" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.980" end="00:42:15.020" style="s2">now the Chi UGA&#39;s the dali lama&#39;s school</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.870" end="00:42:18.230" style="s2">they say you don&#39;t need this it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.020" end="00:42:22.280" style="s2">very advanced theory and this is true</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.230" end="00:42:28.040" style="s2">for post metaphysical process philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.280" end="00:42:35.870" style="s2">also they say that once oops this is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.040" end="00:42:41.240" style="s2">really easy to do draw ja ja ja ja text</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.870" end="00:42:45.290" style="s2">subject I don&#39;t know draw that so once</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.240" end="00:42:47.450" style="s2">this gets complexified okay now this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.290" end="00:42:49.490" style="s2">whatever and you have these forms</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.450" end="00:42:54.650" style="s2">somebody talked about shapes right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.490" end="00:42:59.120" style="s2">you have these forms in the world it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.650" end="00:43:03.470" style="s2">possible that the this the origin is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.120" end="00:43:07.850" style="s2">gone and the way you think about this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.470" end="00:43:10.970" style="s2">an amoeba is the first amoeba around na</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.850" end="00:43:12.530" style="s2">well is you know is the first amoeba</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.970" end="00:43:15.830" style="s2">still with us</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.530" end="00:43:18.980" style="s2">and you know me buzz they divide into</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.830" end="00:43:22.790" style="s2">two and so the original one is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.980" end="00:43:27.590" style="s2">there in a certain way and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.790" end="00:43:30.500" style="s2">there in a certain way and so is this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.590" end="00:43:31.970" style="s2">this make sense so it could be true that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.500" end="00:43:34.160" style="s2">as the process filled self</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.970" end="00:43:40.070" style="s2">differentiates and participate there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.160" end="00:43:44.270" style="s2">no nothing left behind that all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.070" end="00:43:47.180" style="s2">potential in the origin is in</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.270" end="00:43:50.630" style="s2">those parts the way the original amoeba</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.180" end="00:43:52.790" style="s2">is in all the successive amoebas so it</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.630" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t disappear but it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.790" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">question because it problematizes the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:44:02.890" style="s2">search for the origin of the universe it</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:02.890" style="s2">actually may not be there</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:10.549" style="s2">and then this gives a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.460" end="00:44:13.460" style="s2">Peter said you have to trust without a</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.549" end="00:44:16.670" style="s2">guarantee because you&#39;ll never bump into</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.460" end="00:44:18.710" style="s2">where you came from and what Kim said</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.670" end="00:44:24.260" style="s2">and you&#39;re leaping forward with nothing</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.710" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">behind you truly and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.260" end="00:44:31.490" style="s2">cosmology of the zouk gen scholastics so</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.010" end="00:44:35.420" style="s2">processed based philosophy based upon</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.490" end="00:44:37.609" style="s2">the transiency of origin and the</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:56.720" style="s2">can you feel how open it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.199" end="00:45:12.609" style="s2">and and we use this also to get a</p>

<p begin="00:45:12.609" end="00:45:17.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of metaphysical deep</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.160" end="00:45:24.269" style="s2">patterning starting from first</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.559" end="00:45:24.269" style="s2">principles and we used</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.509" end="00:45:27.569" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.250" end="00:45:36.839" style="s2">yes so there is a sense that if the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.650" end="00:45:39.869" style="s2">thing is no longer there the causes</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.839" end="00:45:44.390" style="s2">still can be found why had called these</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.869" end="00:45:48.740" style="s2">traces traces he calls them they subsist</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.390" end="00:45:52.230" style="s2">they subsist as enduring potentials so</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.740" end="00:45:55.890" style="s2">whoever said that that&#39;s true on this</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.230" end="00:45:59.010" style="s2">now now we take our minimal thing and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.890" end="00:46:00.900" style="s2">can complexify all these we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.010" end="00:46:04.230" style="s2">complexify from there we can make new</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.900" end="00:46:06.299" style="s2">steps toward reimagining whole new</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.230" end="00:46:09.630" style="s2">Sciences and stuff the wiggle room now</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.299" end="00:46:11.339" style="s2">we carved off all the epistemic fat so</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.630" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">we have a lot of wiggle room to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.339" end="00:46:18.680" style="s2">reimagine and then and then reimagine</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:18.680" style="s2">what might be the case</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.900" end="00:46:26.210" style="s2">yeah holy cow it landed yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.440" end="00:46:26.210" style="s2">working psychos psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.619" end="00:46:34.490" style="s2">you know when I first started teaching</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.790" end="00:46:37.069" style="s2">my consciousness studies course I got</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.490" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">fired by the chairman of the board this</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.069" end="00:46:45.170" style="s2">transpersonal psychologist from Italy</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:48.799" style="s2">because he said your teaching you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.170" end="00:46:53.980" style="s2">post PhD work and I&#39;m like this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.799" end="00:46:56.780" style="s2">can land with just about anyone right</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.980" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s in a it&#39;s it taps into a</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.780" end="00:47:01.690" style="s2">deeper knowing now not all of us can</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:01.690" style="s2">take this then and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.040" end="00:47:10.590" style="s2">build from it a new I understand enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.950" end="00:47:14.670" style="s2">time or relations like Whitehead did but</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.590" end="00:47:18.450" style="s2">the fundamental fro you know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.670" end="00:47:23.090" style="s2">fundamental metaphysics is something</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.450" end="00:47:23.090" style="s2">that lands with people it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.550" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think this is true until</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.280" end="00:47:39.080" style="s2">recently this is this is a new this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:41.450" style="s2">new kind of architecture of mind and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.080" end="00:47:43.460" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting if some of you</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.450" end="00:47:45.230" style="s2">want to play around with it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.460" end="00:47:47.000" style="s2">lot of questions about what is this</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.230" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s not it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.000" end="00:47:51.110" style="s2">abstraction but it&#39;s not the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:54.650" style="s2">of conceptual abstraction because you</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.110" end="00:47:56.600" style="s2">notice we&#39;re using our body right all</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.650" end="00:48:01.850" style="s2">the things you guys said you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.600" end="00:48:05.840" style="s2">like intuitive so it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.850" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">some kind of I&#39;ve been calling them</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.840" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">cognitive widgets it&#39;s some way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:15.980" style="s2">creating so and it turns out there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">a lot of them come in threes and that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.980" end="00:48:22.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a widget so if you have a widget is</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:25.070" style="s2">designed to do something right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.130" end="00:48:27.050" style="s2">like an app instead of a program so</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.070" end="00:48:29.720" style="s2">here&#39;s the this here&#39;s the universe</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.050" end="00:48:31.820" style="s2">widget you need movement process of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.720" end="00:48:34.550" style="s2">differentiation and participation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.820" end="00:48:37.940" style="s2">then you print you you take that up and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.550" end="00:48:40.670" style="s2">you get a universe so I&#39;ve been creating</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.940" end="00:48:45.380" style="s2">these cognitive widgets for things like</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.670" end="00:48:47.420" style="s2">power and Trust and sovereignty but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.380" end="00:48:49.460" style="s2">interesting thing is to go meta on it</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.420" end="00:48:52.670" style="s2">and wonder what what is this process</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.460" end="00:48:56.140" style="s2">like it requires an abstraction it</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.670" end="00:48:56.140" style="s2">requires a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.470" end="00:49:02.540" style="s2">the thought process itself is something</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.200" end="00:49:08.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not on Keegan&#39;s map I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.540" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">you that so that is also fascinating to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.180" end="00:49:16.310" style="s2">me hmm</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:18.440" style="s2">Bonita something&#39;s coming up so one part</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.310" end="00:49:20.120" style="s2">of this project this Toa is like I have</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.440" end="00:49:25.340" style="s2">a great desire for it to be accessible</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.120" end="00:49:27.620" style="s2">and like I&#39;m a trainer at Dale Carnegie</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.340" end="00:49:28.910" style="s2">Training the whole kind of how to win</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.620" end="00:49:29.990" style="s2">friends and influence people it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.910" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">around for hundreds of years that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.990" end="00:49:35.240" style="s2">company not hundreds 100 years I should</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:36.980" style="s2">say founded by Dale Carnegie and when I</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.240" end="00:49:38.600" style="s2">first took that training there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.980" end="00:49:41.300" style="s2">sense of cheesiness like oh my god is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.600" end="00:49:42.980" style="s2">cheesy and the book is cheesy but really</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.300" end="00:49:45.800" style="s2">resonates with people like it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.980" end="00:49:47.120" style="s2">transforms them and he he would the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.800" end="00:49:48.500" style="s2">Stoics he read all these kind of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.120" end="00:49:51.830" style="s2">traditions and he distilled and very</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.500" end="00:49:54.590" style="s2">simple self-help like you know wording</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.830" end="00:49:57.260" style="s2">and some of this stuff while I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.590" end="00:50:01.730" style="s2">tracking it just a term epistemic fad</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.260" end="00:50:03.820" style="s2">feels like epistemic fad and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.730" end="00:50:06.830" style="s2">know what I&#39;m going with this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.820" end="00:50:14.090" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s curiousity I knew thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.830" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">on that yeah I mean I think first I want</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.090" end="00:50:19.160" style="s2">to I want to acknowledge how much work</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:24.290" style="s2">it is to get these things down to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.160" end="00:50:28.010" style="s2">little they&#39;re at but I&#39;m always talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.290" end="00:50:30.890" style="s2">to people like yourself inviting people</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.010" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">to either for example do the meta like</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.890" end="00:50:37.880" style="s2">what is happening or perhaps to</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:40.100" style="s2">standardize you know there&#39;s a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.880" end="00:50:44.470" style="s2">chrome learning tools that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.100" end="00:50:49.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s like not my work to do because</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.470" end="00:50:51.140" style="s2">it&#39;s very you know I especially this</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.400" end="00:50:53.720" style="s2">stuff I&#39;m giving you it&#39;s it&#39;s stuff I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.140" end="00:50:57.140" style="s2">actively playing around with myself I</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.720" end="00:50:59.120" style="s2">can&#39;t really experience it from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.140" end="00:51:03.320" style="s2">outside I don&#39;t have a perspective on it</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.120" end="00:51:05.510" style="s2">so much but what I like about sharing it</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.320" end="00:51:08.530" style="s2">at this forum is because you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.510" end="00:51:08.530" style="s2">hopefully people</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.910" end="00:51:15.400" style="s2">can create opportunities for for people</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.190" end="00:51:21.160" style="s2">to pursue some of these questions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.400" end="00:51:22.900" style="s2">yeah that resonates but I think also you</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.160" end="00:51:27.720" style="s2">know what&#39;s what&#39;s up a stomach fat</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.900" end="00:51:27.720" style="s2">today is you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.550" end="00:51:36.540" style="s2">that might change what would we call it</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.150" end="00:51:38.820" style="s2">step yeah I have to probably describing</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.540" end="00:51:41.190" style="s2">it for what is a cognitive I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.820" end="00:51:44.730" style="s2">call it cognitive widget and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.190" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">really cool kind of modern term you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.730" end="00:51:49.740" style="s2">but then to explain what it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:52.350" style="s2">and why is it called the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.740" end="00:52:02.070" style="s2">widget it&#39;s gets you start to build up</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.350" end="00:52:06.390" style="s2">more complexity yes could you talk more</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.070" end="00:52:09.990" style="s2">about the you came to a realization that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.390" end="00:52:13.260" style="s2">this this thing can land on people but</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.990" end="00:52:17.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a more recent thing so like before</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.260" end="00:52:20.550" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t I&#39;m just curious what was</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.670" end="00:52:26.540" style="s2">that realization for you I I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.550" end="00:52:31.230" style="s2">it was something there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.540" end="00:52:33.710" style="s2">yeah so since 2008 I&#39;ve been writing</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.230" end="00:52:33.710" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.430" end="00:52:43.579" style="s2">you know I&#39;m a gebser scholar so we know</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.470" end="00:52:45.750" style="s2">from gaps are the the it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.579" end="00:52:48.210" style="s2">developmental consciousness doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.750" end="00:52:51.210" style="s2">develop that it actually leaps into new</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.210" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">forms of consciousness and so that gives</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.210" end="00:52:56.520" style="s2">you reason to believe that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">another company kind of architecture of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.520" end="00:53:04.589" style="s2">mind coming online do you do are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:07.290" style="s2">familiar with integral theory yet so</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.589" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">from the gut serves view everything in</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.290" end="00:53:12.380" style="s2">integral theory along that ladder is in</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:15.270" style="s2">the mental structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.380" end="00:53:16.530" style="s2">okay because it&#39;s linear develop man it</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.270" end="00:53:19.619" style="s2">builds on itself all it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.530" end="00:53:23.069" style="s2">pyramidal it&#39;s meta synthetic so girls</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.619" end="00:53:24.680" style="s2">and more complexity so guests are said</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.069" end="00:53:28.710" style="s2">no there&#39;s something else happening</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.680" end="00:53:30.750" style="s2">right so everything in the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.710" end="00:53:33.210" style="s2">series all the keygen all those models</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.750" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">are development within the mental</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.210" end="00:53:37.710" style="s2">structure of consciousness and then he</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:39.569" style="s2">said something else is happening and one</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.710" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">of the characteristics it would have is</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.569" end="00:53:42.780" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t build up complexity</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:44.900" style="s2">hierarchically it would do something</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.780" end="00:53:44.900" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:54.320" style="s2">so four years since 2012 14 years maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.240" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">2006 I&#39;ve been looking for examples of</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.320" end="00:54:03.080" style="s2">that and I would go to integral 3</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:05.990" style="s2">conferences and kind of give previews</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.080" end="00:54:08.630" style="s2">and get a little traction but both</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.990" end="00:54:13.580" style="s2">basically people hooked up me like I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.630" end="00:54:15.320" style="s2">a freak for many years and my friend Tom</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.580" end="00:54:17.240" style="s2">Murray you may know him from</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.320" end="00:54:21.050" style="s2">he&#39;s a developmental psychologist he</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.240" end="00:54:22.430" style="s2">writes for integral review I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.050" end="00:54:24.020" style="s2">leap forward and then I&#39;ll give you the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.430" end="00:54:26.270" style="s2">middle he came to teach one of my</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.020" end="00:54:28.700" style="s2">courses in consciousness studies and he</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.270" end="00:54:31.460" style="s2">he he taught developmental psychology</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.700" end="00:54:34.570" style="s2">and after he interacted with my students</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.460" end="00:54:39.350" style="s2">he said he said wow I couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.570" end="00:54:41.840" style="s2">talked this level of complexity at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.350" end="00:54:46.580" style="s2">integral theory conference four years</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.840" end="00:54:48.830" style="s2">ago so there&#39;s something about there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.580" end="00:54:50.900" style="s2">something about and I think Chandler&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.830" end="00:54:55.310" style="s2">right it&#39;s the Anthropocene it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.900" end="00:54:58.640" style="s2">fact that these other ways of solving</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.310" end="00:55:00.530" style="s2">problems we know are obsolete we know I</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:04.369" style="s2">mean you guys are young you could go on</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.530" end="00:55:05.960" style="s2">trying to like solve every factor in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.369" end="00:55:07.490" style="s2">climate thing your whole life and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.960" end="00:55:10.430" style="s2">won&#39;t it&#39;s like you know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.490" end="00:55:13.609" style="s2">gonna get to something that way and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.430" end="00:55:17.990" style="s2">our mind even if we don&#39;t want to is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.609" end="00:55:19.970" style="s2">always looking and always in the 60s we</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.990" end="00:55:22.190" style="s2">took drugs for reality testing same</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.970" end="00:55:24.859" style="s2">thing like we didn&#39;t we knew that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.190" end="00:55:29.210" style="s2">reality was it wasn&#39;t like they said you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.859" end="00:55:32.980" style="s2">know and and there&#39;s always the energy</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.210" end="00:55:35.690" style="s2">for the mind to to self transform itself</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.980" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">and some of those are dead ends you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.690" end="00:55:40.609" style="s2">I mean there may be dead ends also</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:42.109" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of psychotic tendencies in</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.609" end="00:55:48.140" style="s2">the new and some of these new Minds</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.109" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">because the pattern recognition but what</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.140" end="00:55:54.710" style="s2">I know for sure is that and I used to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:56.359" style="s2">workshops where I would have do</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.710" end="00:55:58.370" style="s2">exercises and there&#39;d be different</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.359" end="00:56:00.350" style="s2">generations ITC</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.370" end="00:56:02.870" style="s2">and you would set out having people</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.350" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">solve some dilemma like we just solved a</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.870" end="00:56:11.270" style="s2">dilemma and the not always by age but in</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:15.800" style="s2">general by age young people had these</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.270" end="00:56:20.540" style="s2">other ways of solving the dilemma and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.800" end="00:56:25.220" style="s2">say so over time just kind of taking</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.540" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">taking chances that these things can</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.220" end="00:56:30.260" style="s2">land at some point my students always</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:32.120" style="s2">complained that someone said it hit them</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.260" end="00:56:34.400" style="s2">like somatically and then they go home</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.120" end="00:56:35.810" style="s2">and their husbands say oh what did you</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:38.570" style="s2">learn this weekend and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.810" end="00:56:39.890" style="s2">language it because you have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.570" end="00:56:42.560" style="s2">to make an object out of your experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.890" end="00:56:47.090" style="s2">so I&#39;m not saying like all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.560" end="00:56:51.340" style="s2">people come experts in this but trying</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.090" end="00:56:55.670" style="s2">to amplify this kind of new new knowing</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.340" end="00:56:58.460" style="s2">did that answer your question it</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.670" end="00:57:01.940" style="s2">certainly is not being taught it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.460" end="00:57:06.170" style="s2">just being happened and the quite this</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.940" end="00:57:10.070" style="s2">is like the question is if now that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.170" end="00:57:13.940" style="s2">happening can we as educators scaffold</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.070" end="00:57:17.690" style="s2">that to a larger community by naming it</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.940" end="00:57:20.540" style="s2">so this is kind of me naming it and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.690" end="00:57:23.180" style="s2">having it I think it&#39;s important like if</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.540" end="00:57:26.120" style="s2">you are thinking like this and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.180" end="00:57:27.950" style="s2">like you&#39;re weird or something it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.120" end="00:57:31.720" style="s2">nice to have the confirmation that this</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.950" end="00:57:31.720" style="s2">is this is a new potential</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.710" end="00:57:37.540" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.480" end="00:57:37.540" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.180" end="00:57:43.980" style="s2">I had a question something that you just</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.090" end="00:57:45.360" style="s2">said really hit hit with me like if</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.980" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">somebody comes to the class and they go</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.360" end="00:57:49.080" style="s2">home and try and tell their spouse what</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:51.900" style="s2">they learned and they can&#39;t language it</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.080" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">because they can feel it I had that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.900" end="00:57:56.070" style="s2">sensation as we were going through that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:57.780" style="s2">exercise there was something I felt but</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.070" end="00:57:58.890" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know I didn&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.780" end="00:58:02.700" style="s2">word was</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.890" end="00:58:04.560" style="s2">- and so the only word that came into my</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.700" end="00:58:05.940" style="s2">mind was consciousness but there was</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.560" end="00:58:08.520" style="s2">something else I was feeling and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.940" end="00:58:11.820" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what word to put to it and</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.520" end="00:58:15.060" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know exactly what my question</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.820" end="00:58:16.740" style="s2">is but like in my head the story that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.060" end="00:58:18.570" style="s2">was going on is I&#39;m feeling anxiety I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.740" end="00:58:20.460" style="s2">not equipped to be here I shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.570" end="00:58:22.890" style="s2">like you know I could see that story</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.460" end="00:58:24.510" style="s2">coming in and wanting to leave yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.890" end="00:58:26.250" style="s2">don&#39;t belong here I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.510" end="00:58:29.970" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t fully know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.250" end="00:58:31.770" style="s2">how to participate and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.970" end="00:58:34.080" style="s2">area that I tend to be interested in is</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.770" end="00:58:36.630" style="s2">like how do you get somebody who you</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.080" end="00:58:38.970" style="s2">know I&#39;m pretty pretty aware so I can I</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.630" end="00:58:41.400" style="s2">can see okay my anxieties wanting me to</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.970" end="00:58:43.410" style="s2">run and I don&#39;t but for the people who</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.400" end="00:58:49.620" style="s2">aren&#39;t aware of that and like getting</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.410" end="00:58:52.970" style="s2">them into the conversation yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.620" end="00:58:52.970" style="s2">I&#39;m glad you said then in</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.900" end="00:59:01.400" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think I have to convince you</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.230" end="00:59:03.910" style="s2">that something&#39;s landing but you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.400" end="00:59:07.130" style="s2">part of all of this is is</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.910" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">transformational education and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.130" end="00:59:11.390" style="s2">problem is so if this is truly the mind</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:13.099" style="s2">we have then it&#39;s these types of</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.390" end="00:59:16.250" style="s2">exercises we should do with children</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.099" end="00:59:18.380" style="s2">very early on this is what we are this</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.250" end="00:59:21.730" style="s2">is a potential educators need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.380" end="00:59:24.049" style="s2">forth not downloading information now</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.730" end="00:59:25.819" style="s2">one of the things that happen some of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.049" end="00:59:27.770" style="s2">the anxiety comes from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.819" end="00:59:30.020" style="s2">you&#39;re relating to the exercise like you</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.770" end="00:59:33.020" style="s2">should know the answer I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.020" end="00:59:37.640" style="s2">this is so deep in our or that there is</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.020" end="00:59:39.980" style="s2">an answer or or or that the felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.640" end="00:59:42.380" style="s2">is not good enough like if you had just</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.980" end="00:59:44.569" style="s2">drawn that out and couldn&#39;t say like</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.380" end="00:59:47.660" style="s2">you&#39;d be it would be an evocative object</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.569" end="00:59:49.880" style="s2">like what if I erase this and it starts</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.660" end="00:59:51.950" style="s2">to make meaning for you that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.880" end="00:59:55.369" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t fly it would be like</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.950" end="00:59:58.099" style="s2">that&#39;s silly right so we want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.369" end="01:00:01.579" style="s2">transform education because for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.099" end="01:00:06.230" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s been a scaffold this this new</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.579" end="01:00:08.150" style="s2">mind and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s tenacious</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.230" end="01:00:10.910" style="s2">it&#39;s coming online even though you guys</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.150" end="01:00:12.650" style="s2">most of you probably went a horrible</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.910" end="01:00:15.170" style="s2">school where you just were downloading</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.650" end="01:00:17.210" style="s2">information it&#39;s tenacious it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.170" end="01:00:20.539" style="s2">born anyways but what&#39;s the potential if</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.210" end="01:00:23.510" style="s2">we can get in there now you can do</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.539" end="01:00:30.470" style="s2">versions of this with little kids you</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.510" end="01:00:31.880" style="s2">say I it&#39;s kind of cruel but leimia you</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.470" end="01:00:35.270" style="s2">bring them in and they weigh themselves</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.880" end="01:00:37.400" style="s2">on the bathroom scale right kids like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.270" end="01:00:40.789" style="s2">do that right and then they get a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.400" end="01:00:45.039" style="s2">measure how much they weigh and then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.789" end="01:00:45.039" style="s2">say how much does the scale weigh</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.500" end="01:00:53.070" style="s2">and then they laugh something very</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.940" end="01:00:54.870" style="s2">sophisticated is going on in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.070" end="01:01:00.660" style="s2">architecture of their mind when you ask</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.870" end="01:01:02.820" style="s2">them that can you see I can you know if</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.660" end="01:01:05.970" style="s2">I tried to language it it being</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.820" end="01:01:10.410" style="s2">hopelessly complex and kids play these</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.970" end="01:01:12.620" style="s2">games all the time because Dan Brown</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.410" end="01:01:15.810" style="s2">showing that kids have and this woman</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.620" end="01:01:17.250" style="s2">Alison Gopnik she&#39;s saying that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.810" end="01:01:19.560" style="s2">child is a scientist with a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.250" end="01:01:22.890" style="s2">metacognitive mind they just don&#39;t have</p>
