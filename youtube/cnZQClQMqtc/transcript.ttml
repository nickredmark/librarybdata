<p begin="00:00:34.430" end="00:00:40.519" style="s2">to the situation so I decided to launch</p>

<p begin="00:00:40.519" end="00:00:46.910" style="s2">this 24/7 zoom channel but I&#39;m viewing</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.330" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">it more as a digital campfire for us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.910" end="00:00:52.190" style="s2">coherent dialogue but what matters most</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:54.920" style="s2">at the nice edge of our moment and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.190" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">not just a group to talk and practice</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.920" end="00:01:01.939" style="s2">stoicism it&#39;s a group to talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.440" end="00:01:03.920" style="s2">matters most and I&#39;m averaging about</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.939" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">like three events today a day and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.920" end="00:01:07.100" style="s2">just bringing a lot of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:09.640" style="s2">people creative people and were</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.100" end="00:01:14.290" style="s2">experimenting with different things and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.640" end="00:01:18.259" style="s2">today my friend it goes Lee is going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.290" end="00:01:22.580" style="s2">have a talk about a 15 20 minute talk on</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.259" end="00:01:25.100" style="s2">the kovat spectacle and the spectacle is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.580" end="00:01:28.310" style="s2">a term from Guy de Boer about how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.100" end="00:01:32.120" style="s2">sort of are pacified through relating</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.310" end="00:01:33.920" style="s2">with other people through images and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.120" end="00:01:34.820" style="s2">de Bourgh had this as a capitalist of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.920" end="00:01:37.460" style="s2">critique but I think it can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.820" end="00:01:39.110" style="s2">repurposed for many different things but</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.460" end="00:01:42.980" style="s2">I&#39;ll let dillute explain more about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.110" end="00:01:44.720" style="s2">and after David&#39;s talk we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.980" end="00:01:46.670" style="s2">a group dialogue which I&#39;ll explain at</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.720" end="00:01:51.800" style="s2">that point so that being said I&#39;ll hand</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:55.490" style="s2">it over to devote thank you Peter so</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.800" end="00:01:56.620" style="s2">it&#39;s okay if I also record yes okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.490" end="00:02:03.549" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.620" end="00:02:05.930" style="s2">just to have a history of my mistakes so</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.549" end="00:02:08.959" style="s2">thank you very much for being here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.930" end="00:02:12.230" style="s2">I&#39;m very happy to be part of this these</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">ongoing meetings and I&#39;d like to also</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.230" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">begin by saying that please don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:19.790" style="s2">to me as if I&#39;m an expert on this topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:22.269" style="s2">I have no expertise on anything I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.790" end="00:02:25.310" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about these topics</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.269" end="00:02:27.250" style="s2">for a while for the past a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.310" end="00:02:29.950" style="s2">weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.250" end="00:02:33.240" style="s2">part of the reason why I&#39;m sharing them</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.950" end="00:02:35.650" style="s2">is because I would like your feedback</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.240" end="00:02:41.710" style="s2">because I think these are important</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.650" end="00:02:47.410" style="s2">ideas so let me start by sharing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.710" end="00:02:55.330" style="s2">screen if I can start share yes I made</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.410" end="00:02:57.600" style="s2">some some slides okay so because I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.330" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">a background in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.600" end="00:03:03.370" style="s2">again not expertise so so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">start from a psychological point of view</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.370" end="00:03:08.320" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna start with a basic assumption</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:11.110" style="s2">about life so what makes something alive</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.320" end="00:03:14.020" style="s2">and what makes something alive is we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.110" end="00:03:16.690" style="s2">call it activity or we can also divide</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.020" end="00:03:19.060" style="s2">it them can analyze it into a subject or</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.690" end="00:03:21.970" style="s2">an object and the striving of a subject</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.060" end="00:03:25.480" style="s2">towards an object so imagine like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.970" end="00:03:28.300" style="s2">bacteria or a warm striving moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.480" end="00:03:31.750" style="s2">towards food so that&#39;s it basic the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.300" end="00:03:35.910" style="s2">elements anything less than that is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.750" end="00:03:40.750" style="s2">alive let alone mental or psychological</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.910" end="00:03:43.959" style="s2">so subject object but as things get more</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.750" end="00:03:46.570" style="s2">complicated we go from a simple movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.959" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">of a subject towards an object to more</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.570" end="00:03:51.010" style="s2">things so we can have if we assume that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:53.489" style="s2">is activity is the theme we can have</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.010" end="00:03:56.290" style="s2">variations on this theme more</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.489" end="00:04:00.220" style="s2">complicated permutations one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.290" end="00:04:02.980" style="s2">the capacity for equal finality so I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.220" end="00:04:06.040" style="s2">go out of the room through two routes</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.980" end="00:04:08.230" style="s2">for example or I can reach my coffee cup</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.040" end="00:04:11.010" style="s2">with my right hand and my left hand and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.230" end="00:04:14.170" style="s2">both of those achieved the same goal</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.010" end="00:04:19.079" style="s2">they both get me to the same object so</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.170" end="00:04:20.660" style="s2">two paths two means but common end</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.079" end="00:04:24.980" style="s2">another perm</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.660" end="00:04:27.380" style="s2">variation is activity can be accompanied</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.980" end="00:04:29.240" style="s2">with tools this is where instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.380" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">subject object relationship so the main</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.240" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">the primary meaningful relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:36.500" style="s2">between the subject and the second</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:40.370" style="s2">object object number two but there is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.500" end="00:04:43.070" style="s2">intermediary object which we can say is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.370" end="00:04:47.090" style="s2">a tool so this is these images are from</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.070" end="00:04:50.050" style="s2">a primate named Sultan who was studied</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.090" end="00:04:50.050" style="s2">by Wolfgang k√∂hler</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.140" end="00:04:55.820" style="s2">he understood he discovered that he can</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.780" end="00:04:59.180" style="s2">attach for example two sticks to each</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.820" end="00:05:01.640" style="s2">other to get a banana to make even an</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.180" end="00:05:04.940" style="s2">banana for so that too was the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.640" end="00:05:07.880" style="s2">intermediate object which can become an</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.940" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">object that aims with the subject</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.880" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">together towards the second object so</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:15.500" style="s2">activity with tools so we are going</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:19.850" style="s2">somewhere we are making it more</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.500" end="00:05:22.850" style="s2">interesting now we can have activity</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.850" end="00:05:25.790" style="s2">with human labour this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.850" end="00:05:29.660" style="s2">intermediary element is not an object</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.790" end="00:05:31.940" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s not completely it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.660" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">be fair to call it a tool although we</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.940" end="00:05:39.590" style="s2">can but the intermediary element is also</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:42.669" style="s2">a subject so we have a subject using or</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.590" end="00:05:45.350" style="s2">through somehow through a second subject</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.669" end="00:05:47.450" style="s2">achieving a call so the second object</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.350" end="00:05:51.260" style="s2">has to go and get the object and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.450" end="00:05:55.820" style="s2">together they are successful with their</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.260" end="00:05:58.610" style="s2">cooperation so where does that come from</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.820" end="00:06:00.950" style="s2">a Danish psychologist Neil Engelstad</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.610" end="00:06:03.830" style="s2">said that for something like this to</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.950" end="00:06:06.530" style="s2">happen there was they would it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.830" end="00:06:08.740" style="s2">an event in the history of human</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.530" end="00:06:11.540" style="s2">development human evolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.740" end="00:06:14.270" style="s2">something that we can metaphorically at</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.540" end="00:06:16.940" style="s2">least describe with reference to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.270" end="00:06:17.450" style="s2">fall of man&#39;s story with a story of Adam</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.940" end="00:06:19.580" style="s2">and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.450" end="00:06:23.570" style="s2">what is the story we can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.580" end="00:06:27.230" style="s2">this story involved a failing a person a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.570" end="00:06:28.670" style="s2">man who failed at being a hunter failing</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.230" end="00:06:30.710" style="s2">just to hunt</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.670" end="00:06:33.800" style="s2">and would come back to the group hungry</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.710" end="00:06:35.510" style="s2">and didn&#39;t have food and you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.800" end="00:06:38.120" style="s2">there are some gatherers who were taking</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.510" end="00:06:41.110" style="s2">care of the children they had some</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.120" end="00:06:43.580" style="s2">surplus reproductive surplus resources</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.110" end="00:06:48.200" style="s2">so the children could be supported and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.580" end="00:06:50.090" style="s2">grow up and the hunter needs to see in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.200" end="00:06:54.040" style="s2">this in this depiction of the fall of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.090" end="00:06:59.180" style="s2">man we see the man looking at the apple</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.040" end="00:07:01.400" style="s2">with hoping that the woman is gracious</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.180" end="00:07:04.130" style="s2">enough to give some of the resources to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.400" end="00:07:06.260" style="s2">him so he can survive and if he survives</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.130" end="00:07:09.350" style="s2">what happens is that he can go back and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.260" end="00:07:11.870" style="s2">hunt again so the woman can decide to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.350" end="00:07:14.300" style="s2">treat the man as like it some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.870" end="00:07:17.180" style="s2">child child he&#39;s not a child but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.300" end="00:07:18.950" style="s2">also not not a child because he can</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.180" end="00:07:24.440" style="s2">receive support we can receive some of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.950" end="00:07:27.170" style="s2">the surplus resource now what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.440" end="00:07:30.710" style="s2">that the moment a person receives</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.170" end="00:07:33.770" style="s2">investment from another person they</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.710" end="00:07:37.370" style="s2">become economically entangled now my</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.770" end="00:07:39.530" style="s2">friend Peter Andrew Taggert people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.370" end="00:07:42.530" style="s2">have also discussed the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.530" end="00:07:44.870" style="s2">gift also is a form of entanglement the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.530" end="00:07:47.300" style="s2">moment I receive a gift I am now</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.870" end="00:07:49.310" style="s2">entangled with the person who gave me</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:11:01.370" style="s2">where we don&#39;t think just from where we</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.670" end="00:11:03.680" style="s2">stand but we also put ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.370" end="00:11:08.270" style="s2">position of the rest of society and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.680" end="00:11:09.830" style="s2">we look from their perspective more</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.270" end="00:11:13.580" style="s2">famous perhaps is the allegory of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.830" end="00:11:16.760" style="s2">cave we get we inherited we inherit</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.580" end="00:11:19.430" style="s2">these ways of translating appearances</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.900" end="00:11:40.270" style="s2">status okay now those that long</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.570" end="00:11:43.520" style="s2">introduction which has basically the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.270" end="00:11:48.010" style="s2">biggest part of my presentation I just</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.520" end="00:11:48.010" style="s2">wanted to open up the space for</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.110" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">appreciating the fact that something</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.970" end="00:12:01.210" style="s2">like the spectacle and the way we relate</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:06.920" style="s2">to spec spectacles and the way we become</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.210" end="00:12:08.870" style="s2">spectators how that comes about and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.920" end="00:12:11.000" style="s2">it is what what are its origins the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.870" end="00:12:12.530" style="s2">origins are investments education early</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.000" end="00:12:17.180" style="s2">education and our interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.530" end="00:12:21.080" style="s2">other people so this is the now the main</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.180" end="00:12:24.950" style="s2">and key the port a source what is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.080" end="00:12:28.310" style="s2">spectacle spectacle is something that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.950" end="00:12:32.270" style="s2">captures our attention it entertains us</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.310" end="00:12:35.540" style="s2">it gets rid of our boredom and it unites</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.270" end="00:12:37.970" style="s2">us it gives us a sense of being together</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.540" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">that we are together why are we together</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.970" end="00:12:41.089" style="s2">because we are all paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.370" style="s2">the spectacle</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.089" end="00:12:45.649" style="s2">so even if something terrible happens in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.370" end="00:12:47.629" style="s2">the news and we all hear about it and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.649" end="00:12:50.930" style="s2">have nothing else to do but pay</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.629" end="00:12:54.740" style="s2">attention to it and comment on it that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.930" end="00:12:56.629" style="s2">itself gives us a sense of it gives us</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.740" end="00:12:59.329" style="s2">the ability to forget they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.629" end="00:13:01.249" style="s2">individual here and now and join each</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.329" end="00:13:03.620" style="s2">other in paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.249" end="00:13:05.779" style="s2">spectacle another thing that it does is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.620" end="00:13:08.749" style="s2">that it prioritizes appearance over</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.779" end="00:13:11.749" style="s2">reality it becomes more important to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.749" end="00:13:15.259" style="s2">look right to appear right to look good</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.749" end="00:13:17.089" style="s2">so to speak then to actually be good</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.259" end="00:13:21.259" style="s2">so appearance is prioritized over</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.089" end="00:13:24.019" style="s2">reality there&#39;s this line in in the book</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.259" end="00:13:25.670" style="s2">that says to be good the logic of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.019" end="00:13:28.519" style="s2">according to the logic of the spectacle</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.670" end="00:13:30.949" style="s2">to be good is to appear and to appear is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.519" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">to be good and we can derive from that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.949" end="00:13:35.740" style="s2">circular relationship we can derive the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:39.350" style="s2">conclusion that to be famous is</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.740" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">inherently good why because if you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.350" end="00:13:44.689" style="s2">famous you appear in the minds and eyes</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">of many many people therefore your</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.689" end="00:13:49.879" style="s2">appearance is expanded therefore you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:53.029" style="s2">better you are more worthy according to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.879" end="00:13:55.999" style="s2">the logic of the spectacle it also</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.029" end="00:13:58.459" style="s2">prioritizes appearance over action it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.999" end="00:14:03.740" style="s2">prioritizes observing things over</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.459" end="00:14:07.480" style="s2">participating in things so when we think</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.740" end="00:14:10.100" style="s2">about something and events like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.480" end="00:14:13.329" style="s2">pandemic a pandemic like the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.100" end="00:14:17.540" style="s2">kovat 19 if you think about it as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.329" end="00:14:20.089" style="s2">spectacle we automatically because we</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.540" end="00:14:22.850" style="s2">are we have been trained to identify and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.089" end="00:14:25.279" style="s2">to treat something as a spectacle or we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.850" end="00:14:28.490" style="s2">that relationship becomes a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.279" end="00:14:30.410" style="s2">between us and something that is way far</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.490" end="00:14:32.779" style="s2">that cannot really it&#39;s not really about</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.410" end="00:14:34.069" style="s2">me it&#39;s not really about us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.779" end="00:14:35.990" style="s2">something that is at a distance it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.389" end="00:14:45.439" style="s2">make my own choices in a way that really</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.779" end="00:14:49.129" style="s2">is not essentially related to the nature</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.220" end="00:15:03.080" style="s2">it&#39;s good to stay healthy but this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.090" end="00:15:09.020" style="s2">not the response that empathizes with us</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.080" end="00:15:11.570" style="s2">as a collective okay</p>
