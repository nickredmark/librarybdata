<p begin="00:00:13.769" end="00:00:20.010" style="s2">actually see and know and care about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.190" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2">for a whole system shift and if we take</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.010" end="00:00:24.390" style="s2">them step by step as you said people</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">will listen to them and really examine</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.020" end="00:00:43.469" style="s2">I felt I feel so proud to see an</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:48.770" style="s2">illusionary son carrying with such grace</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.469" end="00:00:53.059" style="s2">the full responsibility responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.770" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">able to respond to a radically new</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.059" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">situation with grace charm and actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">pleasure at how complex it is and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">think just that whole attitude is a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:08.460" style="s2">great teaching for all of us when we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">look at situations say I think it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:13.320" style="s2">much for me I would just look at you and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">say no it&#39;s not you&#39;re here because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.320" end="00:01:18.380" style="s2">isn&#39;t too much for you so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:21.380" style="s2">that I really felt that very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.380" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">often as you&#39;re sharing that Einstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.380" end="00:01:27.540" style="s2">comments we tend to esteem the esteem of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">those whom we esteem comes to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">because means a lot to me to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:36.680" style="s2">respect your comment in that way and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">then you know the transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.680" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">perspective how many of the same or</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:46.890" style="s2">similar kinds of insights as we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:48.869" style="s2">these conversations each of us has come</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.890" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">to from very different backgrounds and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.869" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">the places of commonality and overlap</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">but also the places of uniqueness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">difference is such a beautiful fun thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">and there really is like like I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">mentioned when you were talking there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">like a transmission of your being that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:08.520" style="s2">comes through what you teach and how you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:12.220" style="s2">teach it and you&#39;re and you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.520" end="00:02:15.690" style="s2">that clearly nobody else could do and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.220" end="00:02:18.730" style="s2">yeah yes I&#39;m just to add a wonder were</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.690" end="00:02:21.820" style="s2">dickering to me is we have a new world</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.730" end="00:02:24.250" style="s2">of you most people don&#39;t even know they</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.820" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">have a worldview because you swim in it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.250" end="00:02:29.350" style="s2">but it&#39;s a worldview that has all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:31.480" style="s2">elements this new story of creation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.350" end="00:02:33.520" style="s2">you person then your capabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.480" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">when you put this worldview together I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.520" end="00:02:40.540" style="s2">would like to say it&#39;s the most hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">positive guiding worldview that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.540" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">possibly could have and I&#39;d like us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:48.670" style="s2">really notice the elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:51.160" style="s2">worldview that is coming together for</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.670" end="00:02:53.830" style="s2">the three of us and all the sources that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.160" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">the three of us come from yeah to bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.830" end="00:02:58.330" style="s2">together the idea that it&#39;s not just my</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:03:00.730" style="s2">teaching your teaching in other teaching</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.330" end="00:03:03.970" style="s2">but it&#39;s a worldview that can involve</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.730" end="00:03:06.460" style="s2">the world it&#39;s an emergent world it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.970" end="00:03:08.110" style="s2">really is and it&#39;s delightful and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.460" end="00:03:11.380" style="s2">know and the reason we keep coming back</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.110" end="00:03:13.540" style="s2">to first-person it&#39;s how we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.380" end="00:03:15.070" style="s2">embodying the teaching it&#39;s busy this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.540" end="00:03:17.050" style="s2">exactly that place in history where</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.070" end="00:03:20.290" style="s2">there can&#39;t be a split or we actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.050" end="00:03:22.570" style="s2">have to embody it it has to become us</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.290" end="00:03:24.370" style="s2">and we have to become it or there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.570" end="00:03:27.580" style="s2">teaching that&#39;s right so let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.370" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">dive in to two pieces you know which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.580" end="00:03:32.140" style="s2">I think really important pieces we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">highlight and talk about together of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.140" end="00:03:36.370" style="s2">this emergent worldview so in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:37.810" style="s2">there&#39;s this big split that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.370" end="00:03:41.410" style="s2">makes all the time between autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.810" end="00:03:44.290" style="s2">independence in communion being part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.410" end="00:03:46.360" style="s2">being independent being part of right</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.290" end="00:03:48.100" style="s2">are kind of this huge conflict and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.360" end="00:03:50.380" style="s2">could trace of course all of world</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.100" end="00:03:51.670" style="s2">thought and our entire psychology has an</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.380" end="00:03:53.410" style="s2">individual human being but the human</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.670" end="00:03:54.730" style="s2">being and humanity but the balance</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.410" end="00:03:56.830" style="s2">between those two the split between</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.730" end="00:03:58.630" style="s2">those two and you can actually trace all</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.830" end="00:04:00.010" style="s2">of history who said that one is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.630" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">essential and reinterpret or the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.010" end="00:04:03.430" style="s2">you said the other is essential and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.410" style="s2">reinterpret or the other so for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.430" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">the social contract basically says the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.410" end="00:04:09.310" style="s2">basic unit of reality is the individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:10.510" style="s2">to the extent that there&#39;s communities</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.310" end="00:04:12.010" style="s2">because there&#39;s a social contract the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.510" end="00:04:14.170" style="s2">individual gives up some rights to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.010" end="00:04:15.370" style="s2">create some sense of community you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.170" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">a kind of you know Marxist tradition</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.370" end="00:04:20.289" style="s2">emerging out of Hegel that says the real</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:22.180" style="s2">reality is the community right and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.289" end="00:04:23.620" style="s2">the individual only exists to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.180" end="00:04:25.720" style="s2">that they serve the community both</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:26.890" style="s2">actually deny the other and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.720" end="00:04:28.630" style="s2">have people to try and make it a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.890" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">a dialectic there&#39;s a kind of dialect</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.630" end="00:04:32.620" style="s2">hold dance between autonomy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:34.120" style="s2">communion we&#39;re suggesting something</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.620" end="00:04:36.190" style="s2">actually beyond all three of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.120" end="00:04:38.130" style="s2">naturally emerge from our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.190" end="00:04:40.480" style="s2">because actually the psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.130" end="00:04:42.730" style="s2">quality the intellectual cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.480" end="00:04:45.160" style="s2">quality and the existential emotional</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.730" end="00:04:46.630" style="s2">feeling quality of unique self is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">unique self is the place since which you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.630" end="00:04:51.490" style="s2">were pointing to Daniel it&#39;s the place</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">in which autonomy in communion actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.490" end="00:04:57.670" style="s2">that that antinomy that split disappears</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:05:00.370" style="s2">because actually when you wake up in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.670" end="00:05:01.870" style="s2">outrageous love as an outrageous lover</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.370" end="00:05:03.310" style="s2">which means that you&#39;re in your unique</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.870" end="00:05:05.620" style="s2">self your unique incarnation of love</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.310" end="00:05:09.000" style="s2">intelligence you&#39;re fully yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.620" end="00:05:12.250" style="s2">you&#39;re radically wildly autonomous and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.000" end="00:05:15.400" style="s2">you&#39;re fully part of the larger whole in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.250" end="00:05:15.850" style="s2">the entire split between autonomy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.400" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">commune</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.850" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">disappears at a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:21.160" style="s2">consciousness and it&#39;s one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:24.010" style="s2">important breakthroughs in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.160" end="00:05:25.270" style="s2">and in order to respond to this new</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.010" end="00:05:27.940" style="s2">moment in history which either</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:31.720" style="s2">dissolution or evolution but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.940" end="00:05:33.669" style="s2">the overcoming of this historical split</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.720" end="00:05:35.680" style="s2">possible it is one two and three that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.669" end="00:05:37.870" style="s2">outlined moving beyond that that can</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.680" end="00:05:39.640" style="s2">actually birth a new consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.870" end="00:05:40.990" style="s2">without that there&#39;s no possibility so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.640" end="00:05:43.150" style="s2">really just want to highlight that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.990" end="00:05:44.770" style="s2">because it&#39;s the only place that happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.150" end="00:05:46.360" style="s2">last sentence and pass it to both of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.770" end="00:05:48.010" style="s2">you know one of the places people</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.360" end="00:05:50.020" style="s2">experience it but they only experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.010" end="00:05:52.510" style="s2">it in passing is that people have kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.020" end="00:05:54.460" style="s2">of had like a lot of alcohol or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.510" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">another kind of substance I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.460" end="00:05:58.060" style="s2">what it would be but you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:05:59.979" style="s2">there&#39;s other substances that people use</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.060" end="00:06:01.450" style="s2">occasionally right but but if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.979" end="00:06:03.790" style="s2">had kind of being a baby aspirin or</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.450" end="00:06:05.710" style="s2">something like that right so so and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.790" end="00:06:08.140" style="s2">person feels like really expanded they</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.710" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">also feel very loving right but actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.140" end="00:06:13.150" style="s2">that experience right I&#39;ve expanded and</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.160" end="00:06:28.090" style="s2">love so when you awaken as an outrageous</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.500" end="00:07:27.220" style="s2">to say something about what you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.150" end="00:07:31.479" style="s2">that would mean for us if we could have</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.479" end="00:07:36.669" style="s2">something to Marx and then that so many</p>

<p begin="00:07:36.669" end="00:07:44.710" style="s2">personally and collectively come from</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.770" end="00:07:46.630" style="s2">believing in false dichotomies and so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.710" end="00:07:48.159" style="s2">optimize one thing at the expense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.630" end="00:07:50.789" style="s2">another when both are important because</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.159" end="00:07:53.469" style="s2">we believe that we have to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.789" end="00:07:55.330" style="s2">the answer is optimized for both of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.469" end="00:07:57.759" style="s2">those things for agency and communion</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.330" end="00:08:02.020" style="s2">for freedom and connection for we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.759" end="00:08:03.340" style="s2">had the experience of feeling like we</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.020" end="00:08:04.779" style="s2">wanted more connection and intimate</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.340" end="00:08:06.699" style="s2">relationship and they got so connected</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.779" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">our freedom felt lost or feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.699" end="00:08:09.969" style="s2">our you know we got enough freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:12.909" style="s2">the connection was lost and happiness</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.969" end="00:08:15.940" style="s2">actually doesn&#39;t come from either of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.909" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">the poles of sacrifice right so actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.940" end="00:08:20.770" style="s2">in the later in this course I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:23.440" style="s2">dive really deep into this whole process</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.770" end="00:08:26.889" style="s2">of reconciling paradox and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.440" end="00:08:30.310" style="s2">transcending false dichotomies but do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.889" end="00:08:32.890" style="s2">want what is good for this organ or this</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.310" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">organ or you know these cells or the all</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.890" end="00:08:36.520" style="s2">all of them are the questions actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:37.990" style="s2">don&#39;t make any sense when you already</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.520" end="00:08:40.570" style="s2">have a higher picture that shows that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.990" end="00:08:42.820" style="s2">they&#39;re interconnected right and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.570" end="00:08:45.370" style="s2">have unique functions to serve and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.820" end="00:08:46.990" style="s2">the whole needed by the whole and needs</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.370" end="00:08:48.100" style="s2">the whole when you get both what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.990" end="00:08:50.020" style="s2">for the individual in the whole is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.100" end="00:08:51.230" style="s2">same thing so then all the way up the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.020" end="00:08:54.920" style="s2">whole our key</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.230" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">and at every level you&#39;re optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.920" end="00:08:59.390" style="s2">all of them simultaneously and so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:01.460" style="s2">requires optimizing for that for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.390" end="00:09:03.410" style="s2">units and the relationship and as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.460" end="00:09:05.330" style="s2">mentioning so we need to become future</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.410" end="00:09:08.090" style="s2">humans but then to make the future</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.330" end="00:09:09.620" style="s2">humanity think all of the cells just as</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.090" end="00:09:11.240" style="s2">goo aren&#39;t interesting right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.620" end="00:09:14.570" style="s2">cells coming together in a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.240" end="00:09:16.670" style="s2">way so how do we bring humans that have</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.570" end="00:09:18.290" style="s2">woke up to their unique self that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.670" end="00:09:20.330" style="s2">Omni considerate that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.290" end="00:09:23.410" style="s2">comprehensively educated in their unique</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.330" end="00:09:27.020" style="s2">ways how do we bring them together in</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.410" end="00:09:30.440" style="s2">real synergy that creates humanity as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.020" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">emergent yeah thing that&#39;s real not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.440" end="00:09:37.090" style="s2">a bunch of parts bumping and not really</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:39.140" style="s2">in deep relationship and that requires</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.090" end="00:09:41.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not arbitrary how they come</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.140" end="00:09:43.670" style="s2">together right you can&#39;t just hook the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.060" end="00:09:44.840" style="s2">liver up to the small intestine or to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.670" end="00:09:46.790" style="s2">the leg or to the it has to come</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.840" end="00:09:50.060" style="s2">together in a very specific way and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.790" end="00:09:52.370" style="s2">the matching processes the being able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.060" end="00:09:54.650" style="s2">match needs and resources match</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.370" end="00:09:56.780" style="s2">individual skills and genius with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.650" end="00:09:58.700" style="s2">other places match opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.780" end="00:10:01.220" style="s2">contribution with need the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.700" end="00:10:04.460" style="s2">identify all of those things properly</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.220" end="00:10:07.520" style="s2">match them and having that be having a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.460" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">cybernetic process that helps facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.520" end="00:10:13.730" style="s2">that a symbiotic intelligence of a you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:16.370" style="s2">know human and computer facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.730" end="00:10:18.140" style="s2">cloud facilitated capacity is a big part</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.370" end="00:10:19.790" style="s2">of where we&#39;re going close to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.140" end="00:10:22.220" style="s2">technology to do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.790" end="00:10:25.550" style="s2">one interesting observation from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.220" end="00:10:28.280" style="s2">cellular life is the membrane of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.550" end="00:10:31.070" style="s2">multi cell holds and frames the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.280" end="00:10:33.950" style="s2">intelligence that holds and activates</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.070" end="00:10:35.990" style="s2">the script of the DNA itself you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.950" end="00:10:37.850" style="s2">have a membrane so I&#39;ve often thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.990" end="00:10:39.110" style="s2">that the nervous system or the global</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.850" end="00:10:41.270" style="s2">brain when it gets turned on</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.110" end="00:10:44.690" style="s2">sufficiently could be considered a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.270" end="00:10:46.400" style="s2">membrane of consciousness that when we</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.690" end="00:10:49.730" style="s2">have the membrane all the particles that</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.400" end="00:10:53.000" style="s2">are in it yeah will be almost naturally</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.730" end="00:10:55.100" style="s2">more coherent right intuition yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.000" end="00:10:56.960" style="s2">fun way to think about that is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.100" end="00:10:58.940" style="s2">talking in number three about the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.960" end="00:11:00.290" style="s2">Dunbar number and transcending it that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.940" end="00:11:01.850" style="s2">it&#39;s both a limit of empathy and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.290" end="00:11:04.460" style="s2">understanding well we can extend our</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.850" end="00:11:05.059" style="s2">empathy by practice but but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.460" end="00:11:07.039" style="s2">limit</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.059" end="00:11:09.169" style="s2">and what Dunbar saw was it was the size</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.039" end="00:11:10.909" style="s2">of the cortex how many complexities it</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.169" end="00:11:14.149" style="s2">could handle and being able to factor</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.909" end="00:11:16.099" style="s2">all of the complexities that our</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.149" end="00:11:18.109" style="s2">technology has on the world we are one</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.099" end="00:11:19.789" style="s2">brain can&#39;t do that right and a few</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.109" end="00:11:22.129" style="s2">brains talking to each other can do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.789" end="00:11:24.649" style="s2">but but an intelligent cloud actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.129" end="00:11:26.899" style="s2">can so it&#39;s what is a neocortex large</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.649" end="00:11:28.819" style="s2">enough to hold all of it that has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.899" end="00:11:30.619" style="s2">Dunbar number for all of humanity that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.819" end="00:11:32.479" style="s2">then we can interact with and load</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.619" end="00:11:34.219" style="s2">information into and come out of exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.479" end="00:11:36.469" style="s2">and we actually can do that now right</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.219" end="00:11:38.599" style="s2">now we&#39;re really so let&#39;s let&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.469" end="00:11:40.489" style="s2">let&#39;s wrap this piece of it and go to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.599" end="00:11:42.289" style="s2">another piece you have time so what just</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.489" end="00:11:44.329" style="s2">what&#39;s the structural piece we have so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.289" end="00:11:47.059" style="s2">you can access it there kind of directly</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.329" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">now right it&#39;s the image of transcending</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.059" end="00:11:51.609" style="s2">autonomy and communion and you find it</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:55.519" style="s2">by finding an experience in your life</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.609" end="00:11:58.099" style="s2">where you felt totally expanded and at</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:12:01.129" style="s2">the same time totally connected right</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.099" end="00:12:04.339" style="s2">that&#39;s a pointing out instruction for</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.129" end="00:12:06.559" style="s2">this new structure of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.339" end="00:12:08.989" style="s2">again you know as I pointed out and as</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.559" end="00:12:11.119" style="s2">Barbara right deepened into as Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.989" end="00:12:13.459" style="s2">elaborated on all right this is a new</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.119" end="00:12:15.499" style="s2">moment right if you look at all entire</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.459" end="00:12:17.779" style="s2">history of thought and actually didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.499" end="00:12:20.359" style="s2">exist autonomy in commune were always</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.779" end="00:12:23.059" style="s2">thought right to at best being a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.359" end="00:12:26.719" style="s2">dialectical dance of two opposites when</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.059" end="00:12:29.389" style="s2">actually at a higher level literally the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.719" end="00:12:31.489" style="s2">duality of the dichotomy disappears so</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.389" end="00:12:34.069" style="s2">let&#39;s jump into it kind of another piece</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.489" end="00:12:36.109" style="s2">because you know we were talking offline</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.069" end="00:12:38.629" style="s2">Barbara remember yesterday about Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.109" end="00:12:41.179" style="s2">and Technology right and let&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.629" end="00:12:43.429" style="s2">come back to this notion what is Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.179" end="00:12:45.229" style="s2">you know Tantra is this principle of Tom</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.429" end="00:12:47.869" style="s2">you know me you know expansion in</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.229" end="00:12:49.729" style="s2">Sanskrit so Tantra is this you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.869" end="00:12:51.289" style="s2">a particular word in Sanskrit it exists</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.729" end="00:12:53.239" style="s2">in Vedic philosophy but really it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.289" end="00:12:54.709" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a moment in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.239" end="00:12:57.019" style="s2">that actually exists in every tradition</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.709" end="00:12:57.829" style="s2">and Tantra is in some sense has two</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.019" end="00:12:59.599" style="s2">pieces to it</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.829" end="00:13:02.179" style="s2">the first piece it&#39;s the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.599" end="00:13:04.279" style="s2">non rejection Tantra means non rejection</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.179" end="00:13:06.309" style="s2">nothing is rejected and everything has a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.279" end="00:13:08.869" style="s2">place right and Tantra is a trickster</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.309" end="00:13:10.069" style="s2">right it&#39;s always it&#39;s always upside</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.869" end="00:13:12.589" style="s2">down all right it&#39;s Tantra is</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.069" end="00:13:14.449" style="s2">mischievious right and so that notion</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.589" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">that we actually have to with all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.449" end="00:13:18.410" style="s2">ourselves embrace all of life that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:21.319" style="s2">core top</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.410" end="00:13:23.629" style="s2">principal and in some sense right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.319" end="00:13:25.490" style="s2">actually articulating the new Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.629" end="00:13:28.190" style="s2">right and then the new Tantra is the new</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.490" end="00:13:29.930" style="s2">vision right of what&#39;s possible ritual</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.190" end="00:13:32.839" style="s2">pyres that nothing is left out</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.930" end="00:13:35.029" style="s2">everything has a place in the circle and</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.839" end="00:13:36.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a very powerful just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.029" end="00:13:37.459" style="s2">offer that up and to kind of highlight</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.470" end="00:13:41.209" style="s2">that because that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.459" end="00:13:43.129" style="s2">principles is an emergent new yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.209" end="00:13:45.850" style="s2">actually been powerful for me just as</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.129" end="00:13:48.529" style="s2">we&#39;ve been going through this process</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.850" end="00:13:51.500" style="s2">witnessing something I didn&#39;t know would</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.529" end="00:13:54.470" style="s2">be as deep a part of it going in even as</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.500" end="00:13:58.699" style="s2">we created it is this embracing rejected</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.470" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">elements and synthesizing them and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.699" end="00:14:02.300" style="s2">almost every one of the sessions so far</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:05.089" style="s2">there&#39;s been a real key theme of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.300" end="00:14:07.399" style="s2">elements right the human experience that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.089" end="00:14:09.769" style="s2">had been rejected for good reasons</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.399" end="00:14:12.139" style="s2">because they were shadow versions or</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.769" end="00:14:13.970" style="s2">unintegrated versions but the integrated</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.139" end="00:14:15.889" style="s2">versions are totally critical to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.970" end="00:14:17.300" style="s2">full human experience right in paradox</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.889" end="00:14:19.459" style="s2">see the liberal world is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.300" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">non-contract because the liberal world</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.459" end="00:14:25.009" style="s2">its shadow is it&#39;s a big rejecter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:27.319" style="s2">anyone that doesn&#39;t agree with its</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.009" end="00:14:28.430" style="s2">political correctness yes right so just</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.319" end="00:14:29.810" style="s2">like you know we kind of weekly work</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.430" end="00:14:31.910" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of used to casting the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.810" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">fundamentalist says right they create</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.910" end="00:14:36.170" style="s2">other but we&#39;re actually inclusive but</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:37.759" style="s2">actually the liberal world excludes</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.170" end="00:14:39.259" style="s2">fundamentalists and as much as</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.759" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">fundamentalistic slew the liberal world</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.259" end="00:14:43.490" style="s2">and actually in the transcendent include</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:45.800" style="s2">move actually everyone&#39;s got a place</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.490" end="00:14:47.930" style="s2">around the table at a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.800" end="00:14:50.180" style="s2">consciousness this is right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.930" end="00:14:52.759" style="s2">what when nature is in a chaos window</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.180" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">like this it seeks structure of a higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.759" end="00:14:57.889" style="s2">order or it will go to a lower order</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:15:00.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not just good ideas actually so</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.889" end="00:15:03.050" style="s2">when we get into tomorrow it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.170" end="00:15:05.569" style="s2">structure of a co-creative Society what</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.050" end="00:15:08.149" style="s2">kind of self-governance would a society</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.569" end="00:15:11.569" style="s2">have that would be able to do this I</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.149" end="00:15:13.550" style="s2">think that creates kind of a structural</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.569" end="00:15:16.610" style="s2">strange attractor right because without</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.550" end="00:15:18.680" style="s2">some structure the system can&#39;t jump so</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.610" end="00:15:21.019" style="s2">it&#39;s totally I think that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.680" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">so many reactionary but politics</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.019" end="00:15:24.709" style="s2">reactionary religions because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:26.959" style="s2">trying to go somewhere where there was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.709" end="00:15:29.689" style="s2">structure and the liberal community</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.959" end="00:15:31.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the structure and we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.689" end="00:15:33.520" style="s2">just building it right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.570" end="00:15:35.560" style="s2">a very important contribution right what</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.520" end="00:15:37.150" style="s2">we&#39;re doing right now totally mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.560" end="00:15:40.020" style="s2">don&#39;t you have a last thought before I</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.150" end="00:15:42.940" style="s2">wrap it here what do you got for us</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.020" end="00:15:44.950" style="s2">awesome so let&#39;s just maybe put the last</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.940" end="00:15:47.530" style="s2">kind of thought in to kind of wrap this</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.950" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">piece and we&#39;re really finishing and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.530" end="00:15:50.740" style="s2">you know where you are now kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">at yourself you&#39;re finishing the second</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.740" end="00:15:56.080" style="s2">third of the course we&#39;re about to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:59.020" style="s2">into week 7 8 &amp; 9 and so let&#39;s throw one</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.080" end="00:16:01.270" style="s2">more dance into the play certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.020" end="00:16:03.130" style="s2">uncertainty and it&#39;s Barbra it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.270" end="00:16:05.320" style="s2">what you were just talking to and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.130" end="00:16:06.910" style="s2">classical world we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.320" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">conservative or the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.910" end="00:16:11.110" style="s2">fundamentalist world</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:13.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve got certainties and the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.110" end="00:16:15.880" style="s2">world has uncertainty things right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.720" end="00:16:18.190" style="s2">each one excludes the other right and as</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.880" end="00:16:21.250" style="s2">the fundamentalist word excludes all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.190" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">uncertainties right of the liberal world</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.250" end="00:16:24.280" style="s2">and the liberal world excludes all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:25.960" style="s2">the certainties of the fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.280" end="00:16:27.280" style="s2">world but that&#39;s actually a wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.960" end="00:16:29.470" style="s2">relationship between certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.280" end="00:16:31.240" style="s2">uncertainty what if we embrace a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.470" end="00:16:33.520" style="s2">vision which is a critical part of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.240" end="00:16:36.130" style="s2">emergent new evolutionary worldview</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.140" end="00:17:08.949" style="s2">instead of it is true I am true a core</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.130" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">certainty of being and right the liberal</p>
