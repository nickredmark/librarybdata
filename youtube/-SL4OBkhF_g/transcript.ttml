<p begin="00:00:13.590" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">the deal I&#39;ve been having an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:20.460" style="s2">number of conversations over the past</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:24.630" style="s2">two weeks and I wanted to make something</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.460" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">more shared because it&#39;s hard to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.630" end="00:00:26.519" style="s2">this conversation over and over again so</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">here&#39;s the deal</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.519" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">a very important frame that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:34.739" style="s2">held as widely as possible is this</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:36.120" style="s2">notion of a meta crisis what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">it in that fashion so here&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.000" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">we have a lot of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">systems that are always of course</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">interrelating with each other so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">know the the economic system which is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">say that the thing that is associate</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">with people actually doing those stuff</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">in the world is connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">financial system they&#39;re not the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:02.870" style="s2">thing they&#39;re connected but also say for</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">example the medical system so that if</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.870" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">the system that provides medical</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">services is a part of the economy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">there&#39;s also influence know by things</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:12.540" style="s2">aren&#39;t necessarily strictly medical like</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:14.430" style="s2">for example if a if a hospital goes</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.540" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">bankrupt that interrupts the service of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.430" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">medicine to people even though it has</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:18.630" style="s2">nothing to do with the doctors nurses</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:21.420" style="s2">and people all right that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.630" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">general sense in terms of us having</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.420" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">right now in the coronavirus we need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">really grasp the the magnitude and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">impact of the set of systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:33.420" style="s2">interrelated and are impacting each</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">other and how those impacts cross over</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">to really be able to handle and get a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s happening and what will</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">continue to unfold so let&#39;s just start</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">with the medical alright so well the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">medical what I mean is is the virus</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:46.049" style="s2">itself right there&#39;s a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">information that&#39;s now being pushed out</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.049" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">on all kinds of channels and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">lot of noises and we should be clear the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:54.450" style="s2">reality is there&#39;s a lot of stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:55.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know there&#39;s a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.450" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">is based at the wrong epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.890" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">models or it may be bad agendas</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">nonetheless we are getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">better and faster and faster getting a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">sense of saying what&#39;s the current state</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">of the number of cases that have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">tested using our limited testing</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:09.660" style="s2">methodology to different locations</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">according the reporting that the dollars</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.660" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">of those locations use we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:16.320" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:18.840" style="s2">the an increasingly rich amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.320" end="00:02:22.620" style="s2">scientific literature on the specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.840" end="00:02:23.820" style="s2">etiology of the virus the for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:26.460" style="s2">the degree to which is susceptible is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.820" end="00:02:29.190" style="s2">not susceptible to heat etc this is all</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.460" end="00:02:32.820" style="s2">good stuff this is all under the heading</p>

<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">who can understanding the epidemiology</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">how it spreads thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">various kinds of interventions we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:44.310" style="s2">engage in the impact of different kinds</p>
