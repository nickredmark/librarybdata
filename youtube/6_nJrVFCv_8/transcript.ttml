<p begin="00:00:05.460" end="00:00:09.809" style="s2">Percy and I&#39;m a professor of psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.350" end="00:00:12.690" style="s2">and psychotherapy in Germany at Hannover</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">medical school and another institution</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.690" end="00:00:18.090" style="s2">and I have been interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">psychedelic drugs and altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.090" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">consciousness of different origin since</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">40 years meanwhile and I have conducted</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">research in that rhythm for like 30</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:32.279" style="s2">years including clinical studies with</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">different psychedelic substances and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.279" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">other means of inducing altered states</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">of consciousness what was your interest</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">in the mind before then what really what</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">really got you even moving this</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">direction in life so I was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:51.530" style="s2">natural scientist and an atheist at</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">first and then I began to study</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.530" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">philosophy and I was doing fishing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.440" end="00:01:05.270" style="s2">looking at floats for hours and in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:09.090" style="s2">context I got a mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.270" end="00:01:12.500" style="s2">spontaneously and being being one with</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.090" end="00:01:17.540" style="s2">nature and having great feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.500" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">very elaborate kind of sorts and so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.540" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">this was a kind of life transforming</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:27.479" style="s2">experience but in the harsh sense so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">needed kind of three years to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.479" end="00:01:32.670" style="s2">that experience was it irritated my view</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:35.939" style="s2">of the world view in such a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:39.540" style="s2">way that I was completely irritated I</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">even had to get psychotherapy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.540" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">integrate that one experience which I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">have immediately felt to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">merciful experience a human can get that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">was an intuition or an immediately</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">immediate recognition worthy experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">you say good experience yeah it was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">mystical experience of being one with</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:06.049" style="s2">nature and stuff like that and that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:09.539" style="s2">very impressive and so therefore I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.049" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">and life-transforming a process going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:16.200" style="s2">and later on because I studied I was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:18.569" style="s2">philosopher at that point and so I began</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.200" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">to study about mystical experience and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.569" end="00:02:23.430" style="s2">what they mean and what the implications</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">are and later on how they can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.430" end="00:02:27.420" style="s2">generated because usually is we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:29.459" style="s2">them or you have them not this is a more</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">random matter kind of thing if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.459" end="00:02:36.170" style="s2">not a nun or yes Zen master or something</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">and even they don&#39;t have it always and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.170" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">yet so therefore I came across the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">option that drugs might be helpful to to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:49.819" style="s2">induce his kind of experiences and well</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:52.819" style="s2">I was lucky enough to have such an</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.819" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">psilocybin induced experience early on</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.819" end="00:02:57.269" style="s2">which was also a mystical experience a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:59.819" style="s2">full-blown mystic experience might have</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.269" end="00:03:03.569" style="s2">been kind of a revival of what I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.819" end="00:03:06.870" style="s2">experienced before and at that point I</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.569" end="00:03:09.150" style="s2">had the very deep intuition that my life</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.870" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">will be devoted to the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.150" end="00:03:14.519" style="s2">experience or exploring the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:16.829" style="s2">experience the mystical realm as well as</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.519" end="00:03:18.030" style="s2">psychedelic drugs very interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.829" end="00:03:19.859" style="s2">how old were you when that first</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.030" end="00:03:23.100" style="s2">mystical experience first you think I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.859" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">was kind of eighteen eighteen how rigid</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.100" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">was your mind by eighteen because you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:28.500" style="s2">say you were an atheist yeah would you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">say would you describe yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.500" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">someone who really did need to box</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:34.230" style="s2">things up in a way that we might</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">associate with someone who likes</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">mechanism you know and an answer exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:42.120" style="s2">so I was not very much in contact on</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:44.609" style="s2">contact with my feelings and I was also</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.120" end="00:03:46.709" style="s2">having these typical kind of adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.609" end="00:03:49.799" style="s2">crises where you don&#39;t know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.709" end="00:03:51.959" style="s2">and your identity is still something you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.799" end="00:03:54.200" style="s2">have to figure out and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.959" end="00:03:57.290" style="s2">therefore I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.200" end="00:03:59.810" style="s2">I got very much irritated because I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.290" end="00:04:02.030" style="s2">already in a kind of lab Isle a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.810" end="00:04:04.280" style="s2">state and we&#39;re looking out for</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.030" end="00:04:08.660" style="s2">where are the fragments of my identity</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.280" end="00:04:11.540" style="s2">and and that process made me very how</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.660" end="00:04:14.660" style="s2">should I say very open but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.540" end="00:04:16.549" style="s2">point of time very fragile the state of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.660" end="00:04:18.730" style="s2">suggestibility that psychedelics /</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.549" end="00:04:21.799" style="s2">people into and the fact that they can</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.730" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">disorient someone you know at this</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.799" end="00:04:25.730" style="s2">fundamental level which which I really</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:27.560" style="s2">think at one level needs to be referred</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.730" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">to with a mystical language with more</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.560" end="00:04:33.800" style="s2">metaphysical language you know changing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:36.200" style="s2">that around for someone what does that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.800" end="00:04:37.580" style="s2">mean for not only what they think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.200" end="00:04:39.290" style="s2">the world but importantly how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.580" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">going to act in it how they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.290" end="00:04:41.450" style="s2">treat other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:42.889" style="s2">whatever fluence they&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.450" end="00:04:47.330" style="s2">in other people and what that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.889" end="00:04:49.270" style="s2">means for society but before I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.330" end="00:04:51.320" style="s2">we can really talk about that properly</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.270" end="00:04:53.630" style="s2">you&#39;d have to have a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.320" end="00:04:56.150" style="s2">you know yeah what what society is and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.630" end="00:04:59.180" style="s2">what have you so okay so so you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.150" end="00:05:01.220" style="s2">this experience and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.180" end="00:05:04.039" style="s2">psychotherapy what was it about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.220" end="00:05:05.900" style="s2">psychotherapy that helped integrate that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.039" end="00:05:08.630" style="s2">experience for you you know one thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.900" end="00:05:11.660" style="s2">was it we&#39;ve elaborating partially on</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.630" end="00:05:14.090" style="s2">this experience and I made further</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.660" end="00:05:17.000" style="s2">experience during the course of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.090" end="00:05:20.150" style="s2">psychotherapy somewhat and we also could</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.000" end="00:05:23.539" style="s2">integrate this experience and so at last</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.150" end="00:05:28.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve and it also helped me to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.539" end="00:05:31.190" style="s2">all these frigid fragility and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.550" end="00:05:32.930" style="s2">&#39;la by honest and and these fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.190" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">kind of things and it was very very</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.930" end="00:05:38.150" style="s2">helpful because usually if you are an</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:40.460" style="s2">adolescence parents can&#39;t help you as</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.150" end="00:05:42.259" style="s2">effective in that respect so it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.460" end="00:05:44.659" style="s2">if you have another person you have an</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.259" end="00:05:48.379" style="s2">intimate relationship with and which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.659" end="00:05:50.150" style="s2">really looking out for you when and can</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.379" end="00:05:53.389" style="s2">help you when you with you in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.150" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">issues yeah was it was it a man and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.389" end="00:05:58.099" style="s2">woman no it was a man it was a man okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:05:59.300" style="s2">these days in psychotherapy particularly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.099" end="00:06:00.979" style="s2">when it comes to psychedelics they have</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.300" end="00:06:02.210" style="s2">the man and the woman yeah do you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.979" end="00:06:05.319" style="s2">thoughts about that and whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.210" end="00:06:08.150" style="s2">important yeah it is important from an</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.319" end="00:06:11.060" style="s2">archetypical point of view because you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.150" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">have to have both so to say as a usual</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.060" end="00:06:17.210" style="s2">thing but what is also on my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:22.120" style="s2">that it was produced this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.210" end="00:06:25.550" style="s2">setting by cases of abuse sexual abuse</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.120" end="00:06:28.490" style="s2">with people in the early work with MDMA</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.550" end="00:06:31.009" style="s2">and the early 1980s when they had two</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.490" end="00:06:33.979" style="s2">cases which are widely known became</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.009" end="00:06:39.620" style="s2">widely known and there are some issues</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.979" end="00:06:42.229" style="s2">with kind of making people more open by</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.620" end="00:06:44.990" style="s2">these drugs more labile which can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.229" end="00:06:48.979" style="s2">helpful in therapeutic processing but it</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.990" end="00:06:51.650" style="s2">can be also helpful in producing abuse</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.979" end="00:06:54.710" style="s2">you know it&#39;s said using the therapist</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.650" end="00:06:57.319" style="s2">to abuse a patient another aspect is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.710" end="00:07:00.500" style="s2">also that sometimes especially if it</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.319" end="00:07:03.319" style="s2">comes to MDMA if you give em be made to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.500" end="00:07:06.650" style="s2">a patient&#39;s to a patient he might get</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.319" end="00:07:10.550" style="s2">rid of his neurotic fears for some hours</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.650" end="00:07:12.830" style="s2">and so you will see you got a company</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:15.710" style="s2">get a completely other impression from</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.830" end="00:07:18.620" style="s2">the other person he might show up as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.710" end="00:07:20.509" style="s2">completely lovely individual with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.620" end="00:07:23.569" style="s2">of potentials and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.509" end="00:07:26.210" style="s2">so you might fell in love in fact with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.569" end="00:07:28.279" style="s2">patient because of seeing him in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.210" end="00:07:30.289" style="s2">completely different fashion and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.279" end="00:07:32.539" style="s2">there is a certain specific risk</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.289" end="00:07:35.930" style="s2">involved about these kind of things and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.539" end="00:07:39.320" style="s2">I think having a couple there there the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.930" end="00:07:41.089" style="s2">installs a lot of social control about</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.320" end="00:07:41.930" style="s2">these kind of issues and therefore they</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.089" end="00:07:44.870" style="s2">don&#39;t come up</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.930" end="00:07:46.190" style="s2">for me where that links up with in a in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.870" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">another tangential way and we will</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.190" end="00:07:51.710" style="s2">rescue the thread it&#39;s just that when</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:53.419" style="s2">you engage in in the kind of vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.710" end="00:07:55.720" style="s2">a vulnerable relationship with someone</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.419" end="00:07:57.289" style="s2">way where you are speaking well</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.720" end="00:07:59.509" style="s2">authentically to that place of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.289" end="00:08:01.850" style="s2">vulnerability and then with an attitude</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.509" end="00:08:03.800" style="s2">towards change with with the potential</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.850" end="00:08:07.100" style="s2">for help it&#39;s a bit of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.800" end="00:08:09.289" style="s2">involved in that you know it is it seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.100" end="00:08:11.000" style="s2">to me at least like that something</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.289" end="00:08:13.130" style="s2">similar to that mechanism is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.000" end="00:08:15.620" style="s2">involved in developing a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.130" end="00:08:18.320" style="s2">romantic relationship you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.620" end="00:08:20.750" style="s2">you have to it&#39;s quite it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.320" end="00:08:22.780" style="s2">interesting to watch that in yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.750" end="00:08:24.889" style="s2">you go about life in general because</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.780" end="00:08:26.660" style="s2">because you might want to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.889" end="00:08:28.130" style="s2">honest person and an engaged with with</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.660" end="00:08:30.620" style="s2">with those kind of interactions and to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.130" end="00:08:32.450" style="s2">it and and ultimately you should be an</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.620" end="00:08:33.709" style="s2">honest person and otherwise you pervert</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.450" end="00:08:36.229" style="s2">your relationship to being and it almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.709" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">terribly buddy wrong for you but but</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.229" end="00:08:41.659" style="s2">there is still there is still</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:44.510" style="s2">appropriate places within then to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.659" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">guarded in a certain way if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.510" end="00:08:48.589" style="s2">protect yourself or part of something</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:49.850" style="s2">that is unconscious in you so from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.589" end="00:08:51.740" style="s2">man&#39;s perspective if you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.850" end="00:08:52.820" style="s2">young and about it that animal you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.740" end="00:08:55.010" style="s2">getting too attached to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.820" end="00:08:56.870" style="s2">individual you have to you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.010" end="00:08:58.459" style="s2">you have to do have to watch out to what</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.870" end="00:09:00.440" style="s2">it is you are latching you are latching</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.459" end="00:09:03.070" style="s2">onto and I can totally understand how in</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.440" end="00:09:05.540" style="s2">a therapeutic setting you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.070" end="00:09:07.070" style="s2">psychodynamic there that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.540" end="00:09:09.890" style="s2">have to watch out for it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.070" end="00:09:12.589" style="s2">interesting mm-hmm yeah so okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.890" end="00:09:16.550" style="s2">have um so you have the psychotherapy as</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.589" end="00:09:18.500" style="s2">it as it between 18 and 20 watch now</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.550" end="00:09:19.670" style="s2">what about the philosophical side of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.500" end="00:09:22.250" style="s2">because of course you might have had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.670" end="00:09:23.779" style="s2">probably quite a say as an 18 year old</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.250" end="00:09:25.730" style="s2">if I think back to what I was doing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.779" end="00:09:27.560" style="s2">very naive attitude towards the world we</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.730" end="00:09:29.420" style="s2">could maybe call it a naive materialism</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.560" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">of course in the 20th century you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.420" end="00:09:34.670" style="s2">behaviorism very much in vogue so what</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:37.580" style="s2">was it that that that intellectually or</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.670" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">philosophically gave you the new</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.580" end="00:09:41.240" style="s2">grounding or a new space to explore in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:43.520" style="s2">that you could place the context of your</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.240" end="00:09:45.380" style="s2">attitude towards the world in so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.520" end="00:09:47.180" style="s2">somewhat deepened my understanding as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.380" end="00:09:49.490" style="s2">consequence but not out of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.180" end="00:09:52.130" style="s2">experience itself it more indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.490" end="00:09:54.950" style="s2">because I dig deeper and I had a much</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.130" end="00:09:55.310" style="s2">more broader scope and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.950" end="00:09:59.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.310" end="00:10:03.290" style="s2">used by these mystical experiences but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.320" end="00:10:07.070" style="s2">have very concise concedes concise</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.290" end="00:10:09.590" style="s2">thoughts yes and as and also concise</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.070" end="00:10:12.860" style="s2">writing yes and elaborations about</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.590" end="00:10:15.500" style="s2">things but I a kind of attempt to stay</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.860" end="00:10:18.080" style="s2">away from a certain point of view it</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.500" end="00:10:21.050" style="s2">means I&#39;m not a materialist I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.080" end="00:10:23.390" style="s2">idealist I&#39;m not a duelist I respect all</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.050" end="00:10:25.820" style="s2">these approaches but I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.390" end="00:10:29.180" style="s2">hang on one of them yes this is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.820" end="00:10:32.180" style="s2">know how I became that much detached off</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.180" end="00:10:37.930" style="s2">from that but it is more general</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.180" end="00:10:41.000" style="s2">attitude in my mind and I was also</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.930" end="00:10:42.770" style="s2">fought by people because of that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.000" end="00:10:45.110" style="s2">they want to make me they will say</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.770" end="00:10:48.080" style="s2">something oh I&#39;m a duelist I&#39;m this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.110" end="00:10:51.800" style="s2">believing in afterlife and all that kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.080" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">of stuff but I my personal approach as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.800" end="00:10:56.779" style="s2">psychiatrist psychotherapists</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:11:00.620" style="s2">psychologists philosopher is more like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.779" end="00:11:04.520" style="s2">respect that humans have the experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.620" end="00:11:07.070" style="s2">of telepathy if it&#39;s real or not it</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.520" end="00:11:10.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter to me so my research is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.070" end="00:11:13.310" style="s2">limited to the experience and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.430" end="00:11:17.060" style="s2">look out for example if gymnastic</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.310" end="00:11:18.470" style="s2">teachers have more OBEs than others for</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.060" end="00:11:20.600" style="s2">example because they have a more</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.470" end="00:11:23.420" style="s2">awareness of their body scheme and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.600" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">like that other you know yeah we can if</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.420" end="00:11:29.240" style="s2">we can find out a lot by just exploring</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:32.030" style="s2">the experience we don&#39;t have to talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.240" end="00:11:34.339" style="s2">about if it&#39;s real or not but the people</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.030" end="00:11:35.900" style="s2">tend to have these simple things like</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.339" end="00:11:38.810" style="s2">mind over matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.900" end="00:11:40.670" style="s2">that&#39;s all debate you know there is some</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.810" end="00:11:42.980" style="s2">influence of the mind there is some</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.670" end="00:11:45.980" style="s2">influence on the matter so where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.980" end="00:11:48.920" style="s2">problem you don&#39;t have to be so much</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.980" end="00:11:49.640" style="s2">polarized right yes I do understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.920" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">where you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.640" end="00:11:54.350" style="s2">as someone who has engaged in a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:56.029" style="s2">philosophy of mind I suppose it is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.350" end="00:11:57.830" style="s2">interest of mine to try and be as clear</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.029" end="00:12:00.920" style="s2">as possible about what we mean by matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.830" end="00:12:02.330" style="s2">and mean by mind and and well perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.920" end="00:12:04.459" style="s2">can get into that later I am quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.330" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">influenced by I suppose the process</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.459" end="00:12:08.510" style="s2">philosophers bugs on whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:10.300" style="s2">but also Peter Peter our friend</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.510" end="00:12:13.270" style="s2">people will have seen him on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.300" end="00:12:16.310" style="s2">so some variety of pants like is and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.270" end="00:12:19.340" style="s2">it&#39;s quoting quite interesting to me you</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.310" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">know and and the reason for that as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.340" end="00:12:24.710" style="s2">is because because I do find the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">psychological fact the experience so</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.710" end="00:12:30.350" style="s2">important yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:32.270" style="s2">oh that in actual fact well when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.350" end="00:12:35.510" style="s2">follow it when you follow it deep I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.270" end="00:12:38.750" style="s2">as Jung did the line all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.510" end="00:12:41.810" style="s2">between psychological fact and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.750" end="00:12:43.340" style="s2">metaphysical process it does begin to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.810" end="00:12:45.320" style="s2">blur in an interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.340" end="00:12:49.300" style="s2">if you accept certain metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.320" end="00:12:53.090" style="s2">things and I I do quite like I do feel a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.300" end="00:12:56.450" style="s2">resonance with pursuing an integration</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.090" end="00:12:58.130" style="s2">of Jung and the more process philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.450" end="00:13:01.190" style="s2">approach and I think it might bear fruit</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.130" end="00:13:02.690" style="s2">but okay okay so there&#39;s there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.190" end="00:13:04.970" style="s2">things I I definitely know I want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.690" end="00:13:07.010" style="s2">cover with you today yeah the first I</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.970" end="00:13:08.360" style="s2">suppose is to speak to where we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.010" end="00:13:10.760" style="s2">wrapped currently right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.360" end="00:13:13.370" style="s2">upstairs backstage at be on psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.760" end="00:13:16.700" style="s2">conference and it&#39;s it&#39;s been a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.370" end="00:13:18.410" style="s2">interesting few days sometimes sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.700" end="00:13:20.570" style="s2">threatening to be too interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.410" end="00:13:22.400" style="s2">not quite always always interesting in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.570" end="00:13:23.810" style="s2">way I could manage almost every</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.400" end="00:13:25.880" style="s2">interaction you have with someone you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.810" end="00:13:28.220" style="s2">know it&#39;s quite profound yeah people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.880" end="00:13:31.090" style="s2">very very switched on yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.220" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">very interested in in the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.090" end="00:13:35.090" style="s2">metaphysics yeah but what&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:37.250" style="s2">interesting to me and what I will ask</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.090" end="00:13:40.760" style="s2">you about yeah is it&#39;s the general</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.250" end="00:13:42.170" style="s2">attitude and movement and intention of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.760" end="00:13:44.960" style="s2">the collective of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.170" end="00:13:50.210" style="s2">brought here in your from your</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.960" end="00:13:53.090" style="s2">perspective what is the where do you see</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.210" end="00:13:54.740" style="s2">this psychedelic community what is what</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.090" end="00:13:56.750" style="s2">is what is what is there what is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.740" end="00:13:58.610" style="s2">dominant attitude towards psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.750" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">like what is driving people&#39;s interest</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.610" end="00:14:05.900" style="s2">here do you think you have different</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:10.220" style="s2">patterns going on I think one is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.900" end="00:14:13.910" style="s2">you have freaky adolescence always I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.220" end="00:14:16.210" style="s2">mean even three thousand thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.910" end="00:14:19.260" style="s2">years ago they had these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.210" end="00:14:22.590" style="s2">identities seeking</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.260" end="00:14:25.950" style="s2">irritated individuals in this adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.590" end="00:14:28.710" style="s2">phase let&#39;s save 15 to 25 kind of and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.950" end="00:14:31.110" style="s2">the people are much more open to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.710" end="00:14:33.270" style="s2">new experiences maybe even visionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.110" end="00:14:36.030" style="s2">experience psychedelics and so on if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.270" end="00:14:40.110" style="s2">look at the tribes in their former times</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.030" end="00:14:42.330" style="s2">or isolated in Brazil or wherever you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.110" end="00:14:44.640" style="s2">will see that the people are much more</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.330" end="00:14:47.970" style="s2">having much more affinity to have these</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.640" end="00:14:50.430" style="s2">new and maybe irritating experiences to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.970" end="00:14:52.380" style="s2">to clear up where they have to go what</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.430" end="00:14:54.110" style="s2">their personal paths will be and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.380" end="00:14:57.840" style="s2">like that so you have that segment</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.110" end="00:15:00.120" style="s2">always we had that since the nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.840" end="00:15:02.580" style="s2">sixties it was more explicit but we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.120" end="00:15:04.770" style="s2">that since that time you know maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.580" end="00:15:07.260" style="s2">as much in the former Eastern European</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.770" end="00:15:11.160" style="s2">countries which are catching up right</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.260" end="00:15:13.860" style="s2">now but in a lot of other countries and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.160" end="00:15:16.790" style="s2">so it is kind of natural that the people</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.860" end="00:15:19.530" style="s2">look out or search for these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.790" end="00:15:21.180" style="s2">experience irritating experiences that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.530" end="00:15:23.700" style="s2">one part I think it&#39;s a big part of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.180" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">yes yeah as yesterday on the fireplace</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.700" end="00:15:29.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen these kind of people yes and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:32.460" style="s2">but on the other side you have much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.610" end="00:15:34.830" style="s2">majored people which are kind of 35 to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.460" end="00:15:38.070" style="s2">55 or something and they have a more</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.830" end="00:15:41.340" style="s2">elaborate interest in the topic which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.070" end="00:15:44.220" style="s2">much more fundamental in that sense that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.340" end="00:15:48.480" style="s2">they got influenced by the experiences</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.220" end="00:15:51.450" style="s2">and you also have a lot of people which</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:54.540" style="s2">kind of happening having sorts and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.450" end="00:15:58.500" style="s2">attitude like somebody might call a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.540" end="00:16:01.710" style="s2">naive utopianism like oh we can be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.500" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">lovely community blah blah you know but</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.710" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">kind of dissolving boundaries so far</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:12.540" style="s2">that there the differences become</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:15.030" style="s2">blurred kind of and what I realized you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.540" end="00:16:17.730" style="s2">might do that more easily as a physician</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.030" end="00:16:20.970" style="s2">because if you believe that the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.730" end="00:16:24.270" style="s2">you see represent humanity then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.970" end="00:16:26.970" style="s2">might think Oh everybody&#39;s ill because</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.270" end="00:16:29.340" style="s2">the doctor is just consulted if the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.970" end="00:16:31.260" style="s2">person&#39;s are ill if you are working ten</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.340" end="00:16:32.230" style="s2">hours in a clinic you see ten hours</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.260" end="00:16:34.690" style="s2">it&#39;ll people you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.230" end="00:16:36.550" style="s2">saying okay everybody&#39;s ill this is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.690" end="00:16:41.170" style="s2">true this is a kind of perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.550" end="00:16:43.540" style="s2">selection bias and this is also true for</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.170" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">these tiny psychedelic conferences so</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.540" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">there&#39;s just one conference this year</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:52.030" style="s2">explicitly designed for representing</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:54.450" style="s2">psychedelic psychedelic researchers as</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.030" end="00:16:57.760" style="s2">humanity human sciences about</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.450" end="00:17:01.480" style="s2">psychedelics this is here so we are out</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.760" end="00:17:04.060" style="s2">of five billions I think we have a few</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.480" end="00:17:06.700" style="s2">hundred here so we have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.060" end="00:17:10.240" style="s2">that we don&#39;t take this tiny little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.700" end="00:17:13.810" style="s2">for a new wave or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.240" end="00:17:18.330" style="s2">but on the other side what we reach</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.810" end="00:17:23.790" style="s2">right now kind of unexpectedly is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.330" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">psychedelics may have a revival in</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.790" end="00:17:29.670" style="s2">psychiatry and that might lead to some</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:32.740" style="s2">consequences because what we have seen</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.670" end="00:17:35.500" style="s2">through the studies during the last ten</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.740" end="00:17:38.410" style="s2">years is that even the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.500" end="00:17:43.000" style="s2">experience which is really alien to our</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.410" end="00:17:45.370" style="s2">countries and the masses might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.000" end="00:17:48.700" style="s2">helpful in treating depression and if</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.370" end="00:17:51.310" style="s2">that&#39;s true mystical experience might</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.700" end="00:17:52.920" style="s2">become quite more popular that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.310" end="00:17:56.500" style="s2">possibility and if we look more</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.920" end="00:17:58.900" style="s2">neutrally at them we might realize that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.500" end="00:18:01.420" style="s2">they are very versatile experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.900" end="00:18:04.750" style="s2">that a lot of people should have access</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.420" end="00:18:08.050" style="s2">to them and not this kind of random like</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.750" end="00:18:11.910" style="s2">I had by chance thing and that might</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.050" end="00:18:14.980" style="s2">lead in the long run to a more open</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.910" end="00:18:18.130" style="s2">attitude about these experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.980" end="00:18:20.200" style="s2">might be even helped to integrate these</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.130" end="00:18:23.170" style="s2">kind of experiences much more in our</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.200" end="00:18:26.260" style="s2">culture which also implies much more</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.170" end="00:18:27.970" style="s2">people having them yes there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.260" end="00:18:30.580" style="s2">side as many sides of the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.970" end="00:18:32.290" style="s2">world and one side I know as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.580" end="00:18:34.450" style="s2">particular interest of yours is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.290" end="00:18:36.700" style="s2">micro dosing side of psyche terms and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.450" end="00:18:38.680" style="s2">micro dosing is where you take a sub</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.700" end="00:18:40.060" style="s2">perceptual dose of your psychedelics now</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.680" end="00:18:41.560" style="s2">here people have different attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.060" end="00:18:44.230" style="s2">about this so my first question would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.560" end="00:18:45.310" style="s2">what are the dominant attitudes that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.230" end="00:18:47.680" style="s2">see arising in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.310" end="00:18:50.770" style="s2">about the use of micro dosing different</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.680" end="00:18:55.350" style="s2">psychedelics yeah so one thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.770" end="00:18:58.560" style="s2">you can&#39;t inspire the usual population</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.350" end="00:19:01.620" style="s2">doing that because it&#39;s still an illegal</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.560" end="00:19:05.710" style="s2">scheduled substance absolutely there</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.620" end="00:19:09.070" style="s2">there might be some risks induced and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.710" end="00:19:12.280" style="s2">people are will be skeptical anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.070" end="00:19:14.620" style="s2">we are talking about a psychedelic user</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.280" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">population which is already using these</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.620" end="00:19:22.540" style="s2">kind of things and I think there are a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:24.580" style="s2">lot of aspects about that one is or one</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.540" end="00:19:26.740" style="s2">major aspect is that you can take a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.580" end="00:19:29.110" style="s2">psychedelic on a more regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.740" end="00:19:31.870" style="s2">without having all these irritating</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.110" end="00:19:34.690" style="s2">distracting effects and so therefore a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.870" end="00:19:37.870" style="s2">lot of people think oh I can do LSD</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.690" end="00:19:40.210" style="s2">without getting as a risk of being</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.870" end="00:19:42.820" style="s2">fragmented or getting on a horror trip</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.210" end="00:19:45.400" style="s2">or getting a mystical experience you</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.820" end="00:19:48.520" style="s2">know the kind of risk minimization in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.400" end="00:19:51.490" style="s2">the understanding of the people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.520" end="00:19:54.010" style="s2">one aspect another aspect is that these</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.490" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">substances might do something to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.010" end="00:20:00.490" style="s2">human organism which might be good even</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:03.730" style="s2">if we don&#39;t doze them so much that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.490" end="00:20:05.950" style="s2">have these psychological alterations is</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.730" end="00:20:10.300" style="s2">that this it from a pharmacological</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.950" end="00:20:13.570" style="s2">point and I&#39;m a pharmacologist to this</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.300" end="00:20:16.900" style="s2">might be possible but this is there&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.570" end="00:20:19.420" style="s2">to now no reliable AB evidence to my</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.900" end="00:20:22.630" style="s2">eyes that it is really the case this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.420" end="00:20:25.210" style="s2">not that all the reports are not true</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.630" end="00:20:28.330" style="s2">but they are still anecdotal might have</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.210" end="00:20:30.940" style="s2">been placebo induced and so on so we</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.330" end="00:20:33.010" style="s2">still don&#39;t know exactly from a</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.940" end="00:20:36.760" style="s2">scientific point of view if this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.010" end="00:20:40.540" style="s2">really a method which can alter whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.760" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">kind of thing like a creativity creative</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.540" end="00:20:47.500" style="s2">thinking stuff like that what we know is</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:50.830" style="s2">you can&#39;t utter creative singing or your</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.500" end="00:20:53.350" style="s2">thoughts or your thought patterns if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.830" end="00:20:55.660" style="s2">are not doing a dose which is uttering</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.350" end="00:20:58.230" style="s2">your thought patterns if you use a dose</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.660" end="00:21:01.140" style="s2">which is sub perceptual it means you</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.230" end="00:21:03.540" style="s2">can detect it and so you can&#39;t detect</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.140" end="00:21:06.390" style="s2">changes in your thoughts so this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.540" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">beyond the definition what I would like</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.390" end="00:21:13.140" style="s2">to introduce here is that when I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:15.300" style="s2">written the recent book which I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.140" end="00:21:18.810" style="s2">written about my as a science of micro</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.300" end="00:21:21.000" style="s2">dosing I came across a kind of 50</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.810" end="00:21:23.700" style="s2">studies in the past which have been done</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.000" end="00:21:25.890" style="s2">with very low doses nobody knows about</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.700" end="00:21:27.780" style="s2">that the whole internet is free of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.890" end="00:21:30.660" style="s2">there&#39;s no knowledge and this is how the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.780" end="00:21:32.790" style="s2">Internet can generate illusions because</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.660" end="00:21:35.610" style="s2">they people don&#39;t look at the past</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.790" end="00:21:39.060" style="s2">anymore they are just in the now which</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.610" end="00:21:41.730" style="s2">is mindful but maybe idiotic in another</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.060" end="00:21:43.560" style="s2">sense that they ignore the past and they</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.730" end="00:21:46.650" style="s2">don&#39;t know about and what we know from</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.560" end="00:21:48.780" style="s2">these early studies is that above 20</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.650" end="00:21:52.970" style="s2">micrograms you get a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.780" end="00:21:56.730" style="s2">effect which might in some rare cases in</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.970" end="00:21:59.460" style="s2">behave in a way that people might become</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.730" end="00:22:02.250" style="s2">a little more creative but I would bet</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.460" end="00:22:04.950" style="s2">that because of individuals and sative</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.250" end="00:22:08.550" style="s2">ities about the substance even if he</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.950" end="00:22:10.800" style="s2">would dose them within quality known and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.550" end="00:22:13.620" style="s2">purity known stuff and could give</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.800" end="00:22:17.220" style="s2">everybody 20 micrograms or let&#39;s say 30</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.620" end="00:22:19.890" style="s2">or something they would still have</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.220" end="00:22:22.440" style="s2">completely different reactions somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.890" end="00:22:25.590" style="s2">and so therefore it&#39;s very hard to dose</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.440" end="00:22:28.500" style="s2">in the room what I call above 20</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.590" end="00:22:31.170" style="s2">micrograms where you get some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.500" end="00:22:36.030" style="s2">effect I would like to call that mini</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.170" end="00:22:38.070" style="s2">dosing coming from 20 to 50 and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.030" end="00:22:40.350" style="s2">the people which have micro dosed in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.070" end="00:22:43.230" style="s2">past for example about Huisman the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:46.200" style="s2">discoverer of LSD has done in a more or</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.230" end="00:22:50.010" style="s2">less erratic fashion let&#39;s say five to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:53.580" style="s2">seven times a year at maximum he did 30</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.010" end="00:22:56.220" style="s2">to 90 milli micro grams and that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.580" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">quite a different deal then you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.220" end="00:23:00.210" style="s2">some effects it&#39;s not a full-blown</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:02.850" style="s2">experience yes we know from recent</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.210" end="00:23:08.010" style="s2">research that the full blown LSD</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.850" end="00:23:10.140" style="s2">experience needs 200 micrograms then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.010" end="00:23:11.850" style="s2">have the full-blown effects</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.140" end="00:23:13.830" style="s2">if you go lower you have less effects</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.850" end="00:23:17.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not a bad thing it might be even</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.830" end="00:23:21.420" style="s2">good but we still have to define where</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.430" end="00:23:23.490" style="s2">what micro dozing in that sense is yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.420" end="00:23:28.470" style="s2">it&#39;s really tough isn&#39;t it I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.490" end="00:23:30.630" style="s2">tough to get a grip on what the full LSD</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.470" end="00:23:32.550" style="s2">experience would really be I mean do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.630" end="00:23:34.500" style="s2">mean to refer to the peak breakthrough</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.550" end="00:23:36.630" style="s2">mystical experiences okay you know no</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.500" end="00:23:38.820" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just that we know from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.630" end="00:23:41.310" style="s2">question your profiles yes and from</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.820" end="00:23:43.350" style="s2">clinical experience that you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.310" end="00:23:46.410" style="s2">much more if you get a higher dose and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.350" end="00:23:49.160" style="s2">you get somewhat less if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.410" end="00:23:51.480" style="s2">lower dose so we know that all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.160" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">responses on these questionnaires they</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.480" end="00:23:57.210" style="s2">got maximum activated when you have that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:59.940" style="s2">kind of those and you got much less if</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.210" end="00:24:03.210" style="s2">you get lower doses okay so but that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.940" end="00:24:06.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean like with a car you can run</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.210" end="00:24:10.890" style="s2">200 miles let&#39;s say with an sports car</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.630" end="00:24:14.040" style="s2">but you usually run 50 right and so if</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.890" end="00:24:17.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a speed of 50 is much more usable</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.040" end="00:24:19.830" style="s2">for you in the average day then running</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.430" end="00:24:21.750" style="s2">200 you know you know what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.830" end="00:24:24.930" style="s2">about yes so it doesn&#39;t mean that a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.750" end="00:24:26.970" style="s2">hundred micrograms for example can do a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.930" end="00:24:30.540" style="s2">lot in respect to psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.970" end="00:24:33.000" style="s2">processing which might you which might</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.540" end="00:24:34.710" style="s2">be not as optimal with a full dose yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.000" end="00:24:36.330" style="s2">and so therefore I&#39;m not discriminating</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.710" end="00:24:41.370" style="s2">lower dosages or something yes no</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.330" end="00:24:46.020" style="s2">absolutely I mean it&#39;s one thing for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.370" end="00:24:48.300" style="s2">that other eye that I not quite seeing</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.020" end="00:24:51.930" style="s2">as much in conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.300" end="00:24:55.380" style="s2">psychedelics is really what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.930" end="00:24:58.620" style="s2">fundamental aim is whether whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.380" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">for an individual&#39;s life or a collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.620" end="00:25:01.740" style="s2">now people are talking about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:06.240" style="s2">not like people aren&#39;t interested in</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.740" end="00:25:08.670" style="s2">aims of course and as far as therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.240" end="00:25:10.440" style="s2">goals go well obviously it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.670" end="00:25:12.150" style="s2">dealing with trauma in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.440" end="00:25:13.770" style="s2">it no longer holds back the individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.150" end="00:25:16.350" style="s2">and causes them some degree of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.770" end="00:25:18.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s integrating that in such</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.350" end="00:25:20.100" style="s2">a way that something can be learned from</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.180" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">there so that they don&#39;t repeat the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.100" end="00:25:24.419" style="s2">cycle of of bad behave</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:26.039" style="s2">d habituates you know it can take away</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.419" end="00:25:27.630" style="s2">that the negative self narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.039" end="00:25:30.149" style="s2">that&#39;s all that&#39;s all good right there I</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.630" end="00:25:32.250" style="s2">can understand how if someone&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.149" end="00:25:34.769" style="s2">wound they&#39;re in a physiological sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.250" end="00:25:38.309" style="s2">we can roughly help it out but but in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.769" end="00:25:41.100" style="s2">terms of in terms of really patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.309" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">behavior to aim at in life that there</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.100" end="00:25:47.880" style="s2">are that are good well I guess the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:49.500" style="s2">point I&#39;m making is that the experience</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.880" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have on psychedelics is</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.500" end="00:25:54.120" style="s2">in part determined by how you are</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:55.799" style="s2">actually living and what you are doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.120" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">not only what your intention is for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.799" end="00:25:59.759" style="s2">day if it&#39;s writing if it&#39;s you know if</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:01.500" style="s2">you want to have if you&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.759" end="00:26:03.269" style="s2">an exam and you take a really high dose</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.500" end="00:26:04.679" style="s2">of LSD it&#39;s going to be tough for you to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.269" end="00:26:07.110" style="s2">maintain the right kind of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.679" end="00:26:10.379" style="s2">often so obviously there&#39;s certain tool</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.110" end="00:26:12.590" style="s2">for a time in place but I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.379" end="00:26:17.370" style="s2">does concern me I suppose is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.590" end="00:26:20.779" style="s2">exploration for explorations sake at</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.370" end="00:26:23.159" style="s2">when that exploration isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.779" end="00:26:26.519" style="s2">fundamentally in an important sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.159" end="00:26:31.080" style="s2">grounded to something vital in the home</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.519" end="00:26:33.389" style="s2">that itself is the base from which the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.080" end="00:26:35.220" style="s2">very image of what to move towards is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.389" end="00:26:37.019" style="s2">projected so it&#39;s kind of a Union idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.220" end="00:26:39.570" style="s2">the idea of the god image in which in</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.019" end="00:26:41.820" style="s2">one sense is combination of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.570" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">conscious and unconscious psychic life</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.820" end="00:26:51.120" style="s2">but in another sense I guess the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:53.610" style="s2">grounds from which the image of what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.120" end="00:26:55.379" style="s2">missing in the psyche or or what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.610" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">missing in the individual is projected</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.379" end="00:26:59.639" style="s2">into the future innocence is the goal to</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:01.289" style="s2">which individuation moves like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.639" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">really have movement without a goal</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.289" end="00:27:06.179" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s sort of static inkay like</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:07.950" style="s2">oh sorry it&#39;s a sort of chaotic so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.179" end="00:27:09.779" style="s2">know this is a fairly I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.950" end="00:27:11.610" style="s2">throwing things out here and but but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.779" end="00:27:18.649" style="s2">what I&#39;m concerned with most of all is</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.610" end="00:27:23.669" style="s2">is that what is good in our culture&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.649" end="00:27:28.169" style="s2">involved in coordinating to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.669" end="00:27:31.139" style="s2">our aims for using psychedelics is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.169" end="00:27:33.750" style="s2">I mean Oh am I making myself somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.139" end="00:27:36.200" style="s2">clear with at least the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.750" end="00:27:41.779" style="s2">thinking about things this way does this</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.200" end="00:27:45.320" style="s2">like in a helpful way of thinking so if</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.779" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">it if it comes to what also might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.320" end="00:27:52.700" style="s2">called after or with Abraham Maslow the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:55.010" style="s2">self-actualization it has some some</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.700" end="00:27:58.460" style="s2">parallels to the innovative iteration</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.010" end="00:28:01.929" style="s2">process allow young yes but I would</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.460" end="00:28:05.630" style="s2">think that you can have different</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.929" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">approaches in that respect so if you for</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.630" end="00:28:10.039" style="s2">example expand your consciousness by a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:13.549" style="s2">psychedelic substance you might become</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.039" end="00:28:16.450" style="s2">aware of reams of yourself your</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.549" end="00:28:18.350" style="s2">relationships and your</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.450" end="00:28:20.450" style="s2">self-actualization process or your</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.350" end="00:28:23.539" style="s2">individuation process yes which you</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.450" end="00:28:25.250" style="s2">might have neglected before there could</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.539" end="00:28:27.470" style="s2">be one thing so that could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.250" end="00:28:31.519" style="s2">potentially enriching if you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.470" end="00:28:33.830" style="s2">integrate the risk in a responsible way</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.519" end="00:28:36.830" style="s2">you can integrate these parts which you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.830" end="00:28:41.389" style="s2">have had neglect neglect it before but</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.830" end="00:28:43.549" style="s2">it also HEIs ins your responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.389" end="00:28:46.250" style="s2">we have to think about that the other</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.250" end="00:28:53.149" style="s2">conscious of your neglect because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.950" end="00:28:56.690" style="s2">using the drug to avoid realizing new</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.149" end="00:29:00.980" style="s2">your neglects and we see that somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.690" end="00:29:03.710" style="s2">more than the appropriate way to handle</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.980" end="00:29:07.130" style="s2">these kind of experiences and to allow</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.710" end="00:29:10.519" style="s2">them so there&#39;s also something which an</p>

<p begin="00:29:13.789" end="00:29:18.559" style="s2">he said to me when I learned with him</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.490" end="00:29:23.769" style="s2">and he said you know we have sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:27.230" style="s2">these patients which have these avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.769" end="00:29:30.980" style="s2">enjoyment so they enjoy the experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.230" end="00:29:35.179" style="s2">by avoiding the problematic part of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.980" end="00:29:38.539" style="s2">they avoid the neglect they avoid their</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.240" end="00:29:46.570" style="s2">and so on and so in the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.789" end="00:29:49.149" style="s2">culture in fact if you look at this</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.570" end="00:29:52.809" style="s2">partially crude settings where the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.149" end="00:29:55.749" style="s2">protects the drugs it&#39;s mostly music and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.809" end="00:29:58.299" style="s2">a lot of outside stimuli so that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.749" end="00:30:01.149" style="s2">don&#39;t come to a meditative attitude</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.299" end="00:30:03.580" style="s2">where you can evaluate yourself maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.149" end="00:30:06.039" style="s2">from a higher kind of perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.580" end="00:30:08.409" style="s2">higher self also so that you really can</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.039" end="00:30:11.529" style="s2">make conclusions and having insights and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.409" end="00:30:14.109" style="s2">and experiences which really broaden</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.529" end="00:30:19.119" style="s2">your scope you know a lot of times for</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.109" end="00:30:24.099" style="s2">example if you have an at Tibetan clan</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.119" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">Shaolin this is Tibetan belts you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.099" end="00:30:29.320" style="s2">going going on you know it gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:31.450" style="s2">very smooth sound you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.320" end="00:30:34.389" style="s2">completely different if it comes to your</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.450" end="00:30:38.109" style="s2">personal attention about yourself that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.389" end="00:30:42.549" style="s2">might be helpful but if you here for</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.109" end="00:30:44.950" style="s2">example tape with Jimi Hendrix you might</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.549" end="00:30:47.409" style="s2">put your attention only on the lead</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.950" end="00:30:50.229" style="s2">guitar so it&#39;s a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.409" end="00:30:53.019" style="s2">deal and this is why a lot of people I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.229" end="00:30:55.389" style="s2">would say 80% of the users of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.019" end="00:30:58.419" style="s2">psychedelics don&#39;t profit from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.389" end="00:31:02.200" style="s2">experience at as much because they use</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.419" end="00:31:04.450" style="s2">it in a very extroverted way and having</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.200" end="00:31:07.539" style="s2">a lot of stimuli from the outside having</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.450" end="00:31:11.109" style="s2">open eyes they don&#39;t go they simply</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.539" end="00:31:14.409" style="s2">don&#39;t go inside so they avoid the inside</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.109" end="00:31:16.509" style="s2">which is the original purpose to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.409" end="00:31:19.809" style="s2">psychedelics but we also have to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.509" end="00:31:22.149" style="s2">tolerant about ecstatic experiences in</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.809" end="00:31:25.509" style="s2">general so they generate ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.149" end="00:31:28.929" style="s2">experiences but without realising what</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.509" end="00:31:31.359" style="s2">they can do with themselves on the drugs</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.929" end="00:31:34.989" style="s2">let me just finish these thoughts with</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.359" end="00:31:38.950" style="s2">one thing kind of 10 years ago they</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.989" end="00:31:42.460" style="s2">interviewed the major techno DJ in</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.950" end="00:31:44.769" style="s2">Germany and at the last point in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.460" end="00:31:46.779" style="s2">interview they said to him is there</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.769" end="00:31:49.629" style="s2">anything you want to say to the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.779" end="00:31:54.279" style="s2">from your side and from your heart and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.629" end="00:31:58.299" style="s2">he said yeah the essence is take MDMA at</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.279" end="00:32:01.330" style="s2">home close your eyes have a place in bed</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.299" end="00:32:03.749" style="s2">and here soft music this is my</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.330" end="00:32:06.249" style="s2">recommendation because this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.749" end="00:32:09.159" style="s2">experience what you can get from Emily</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.249" end="00:32:13.059" style="s2">May for example or even LSD and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.159" end="00:32:16.749" style="s2">avoid by having these very loud and</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.059" end="00:32:17.409" style="s2">stimulating outside stimuli dominated</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.749" end="00:32:19.599" style="s2">settings</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.409" end="00:32:22.629" style="s2">he has very very interesting very</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.599" end="00:32:24.609" style="s2">interesting let me let me try and get at</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.629" end="00:32:26.649" style="s2">this idea which you&#39;ve helped illuminate</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.609" end="00:32:27.969" style="s2">slightly it&#39;s I guess what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.649" end="00:32:30.789" style="s2">do is actually work through something I</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.969" end="00:32:33.369" style="s2">can&#39;t articulate properly but we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.789" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">here where we are so and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.369" end="00:32:39.519" style="s2">idea is that well it would be it would</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:42.940" style="s2">be to speculate as to why people might</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.519" end="00:32:44.950" style="s2">be resistant to really look with him and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.940" end="00:32:46.839" style="s2">now of course there is a lot to say here</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.950" end="00:32:48.519" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean to encapsulate it all I</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.839" end="00:32:52.289" style="s2">mean - I mean to speak to a small</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.519" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">fragment of it and that would be that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.289" end="00:33:00.249" style="s2">you know there are lots of things about</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:33:04.529" style="s2">how we live and how we process that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.249" end="00:33:08.229" style="s2">appear arbitrary if you become</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.529" end="00:33:10.479" style="s2">disoriented from the deeper patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.229" end="00:33:14.499" style="s2">action that they are actually involved</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.479" end="00:33:15.609" style="s2">in supporting you know an experience I</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.499" end="00:33:17.229" style="s2">had not long ago and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.609" end="00:33:19.989" style="s2">extroverted experience I suppose to some</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.229" end="00:33:22.179" style="s2">degree but I was walking along and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.989" end="00:33:24.359" style="s2">there was a guy driving his car you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.179" end="00:33:26.769" style="s2">and it was an old quite beautiful car</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.359" end="00:33:27.999" style="s2">but I&#39;m sure he was doing the same old</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.769" end="00:33:29.859" style="s2">things that everybody else does with</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.999" end="00:33:31.869" style="s2">cars you know use it to get from home to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.859" end="00:33:33.609" style="s2">work and he&#39;s got dinner later on and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.869" end="00:33:38.769" style="s2">then he goes about his day and there I</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.609" end="00:33:43.649" style="s2">am on LSD sort of disoriented from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.769" end="00:33:46.839" style="s2">at least they&#39;re phenomenally present</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.649" end="00:33:48.759" style="s2">realization of the normal way to be you</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.839" end="00:33:51.219" style="s2">know I mean you see things for their</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.759" end="00:33:54.309" style="s2">slightly arbitrary nature and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.219" end="00:33:56.829" style="s2">concern might be it to make this more</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.309" end="00:34:00.059" style="s2">slightly more mystical and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.829" end="00:34:03.479" style="s2">than I can properly speak to is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.059" end="00:34:07.239" style="s2">well I think people sometimes mistake in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.479" end="00:34:09.190" style="s2">some cases the necessary actions that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.239" end="00:34:10.770" style="s2">do to keep society functioning to keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.190" end="00:34:13.830" style="s2">our lives working</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.770" end="00:34:16.169" style="s2">because we do actually have important</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.830" end="00:34:18.419" style="s2">cares whether it&#39;s to to to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.169" end="00:34:21.810" style="s2">health of our family or ourselves or or</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.419" end="00:34:24.570" style="s2">our community we are agents in a grander</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.810" end="00:34:26.010" style="s2">pattern of collective behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.570" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">needs to function in a certain way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.010" end="00:34:32.010" style="s2">continue not falling into chaos and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:36.270" style="s2">the concern is that sometimes when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.010" end="00:34:40.139" style="s2">look within even it should be fine you</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.270" end="00:34:41.700" style="s2">lose orientation to to the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.139" end="00:34:43.080" style="s2">really you really shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.700" end="00:34:46.020" style="s2">and then people suddenly feel like oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.080" end="00:34:48.149" style="s2">I&#39;m off you know I&#39;m it so it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.020" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">be decentralized or that&#39;s all bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.149" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">that&#39;s also stupid why are we doing it</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:54.629" style="s2">you know and I wonder I wonder if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:58.670" style="s2">because in some sense we are detached</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.629" end="00:35:01.050" style="s2">from ultimately a symbolic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.670" end="00:35:03.090" style="s2">some kind of deeper symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.050" end="00:35:05.170" style="s2">relationship to our culture let me check</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.090" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">on that camera though</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.170" end="00:35:11.140" style="s2">okay Torsten we are back minor technical</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:15.339" style="s2">difficulties difficulties again yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.140" end="00:35:20.019" style="s2">yeah where my mind is at now has gone</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.339" end="00:35:22.089" style="s2">from well I suppose it&#39;s mainly at</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.019" end="00:35:23.829" style="s2">burgers we&#39;ve been talking about some</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.089" end="00:35:25.450" style="s2">burgers here they&#39;re charging a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.829" end="00:35:27.039" style="s2">bit too much actually in my opinion but</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.450" end="00:35:31.740" style="s2">it&#39;s fine I mean people have got to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.039" end="00:35:33.519" style="s2">their money so I was talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.740" end="00:35:39.609" style="s2">concern I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.519" end="00:35:44.260" style="s2">when psychedelic experience can to an</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.609" end="00:35:46.089" style="s2">individual reveal a kind of arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.260" end="00:35:52.750" style="s2">nature to some of our beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.089" end="00:35:55.170" style="s2">actions and then also sometimes throw</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.750" end="00:35:59.529" style="s2">the baby out with the bathwater in</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.170" end="00:36:02.920" style="s2">respect of the ultimately vital and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.529" end="00:36:06.609" style="s2">living and important grandeur structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.920" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">of patterns of behavior that are good</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.609" end="00:36:12.670" style="s2">that those ideas or that those</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:14.490" style="s2">experiences can jar against so you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.670" end="00:36:18.250" style="s2">comment on that if you like or I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.490" end="00:36:20.589" style="s2">you can tell me about anything you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.250" end="00:36:23.230" style="s2">in particular to say about what people</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.589" end="00:36:25.150" style="s2">should be wary of in psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.230" end="00:36:27.009" style="s2">experience when they look within and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.150" end="00:36:30.730" style="s2">perhaps talk about why it is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.009" end="00:36:34.569" style="s2">sometimes people don&#39;t wish to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.730" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">their inner life so I think I&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.569" end="00:36:41.289" style="s2">by there by going on something what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:43.869" style="s2">mentioned which is that people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.289" end="00:36:45.880" style="s2">have the usual concepts in their mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.869" end="00:36:49.000" style="s2">when they are on a psychedelic drug and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.880" end="00:36:51.579" style="s2">I think that is a really under</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.000" end="00:36:54.490" style="s2">researched area of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.579" end="00:36:57.220" style="s2">experiences that because the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.490" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">somewhat irritated you don&#39;t have your</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.220" end="00:37:03.180" style="s2">usual conceptual knowledge available to</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:06.789" style="s2">evaluate things in the outer world and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.180" end="00:37:09.220" style="s2">but it also frees you somewhat from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.789" end="00:37:11.769" style="s2">concept so you can see much more of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.220" end="00:37:14.890" style="s2">things you you see because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.769" end="00:37:16.990" style="s2">kind of putting concepts onto them ok</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.890" end="00:37:18.130" style="s2">this is a bird of this kind this is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:20.619" style="s2">person this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.130" end="00:37:24.190" style="s2">camera and so on you can look with much</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.619" end="00:37:26.829" style="s2">more than a kind of open mind or open</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.190" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">perception at things because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.829" end="00:37:33.609" style="s2">connect them too much to your previous</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:38.500" style="s2">experience by using contact concepts to</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.609" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">to evaluate them or or to to get hold of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.500" end="00:37:44.799" style="s2">them now or to to see what purpose they</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:46.950" style="s2">have or if they are dangerous or not and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.799" end="00:37:50.799" style="s2">stuff like that this can be very</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.950" end="00:37:54.039" style="s2">interesting to to be beyond human</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.799" end="00:37:56.680" style="s2">concepts and then there can be even a</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.039" end="00:38:01.029" style="s2">much deeper kind of perception going on</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.680" end="00:38:03.700" style="s2">what you can realize when you encounter</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.029" end="00:38:05.049" style="s2">an animal on a psychedelic truck I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.700" end="00:38:06.789" style="s2">if you are honest like under the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.049" end="00:38:10.119" style="s2">influence of a psychedelic drug like LSD</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.789" end="00:38:12.609" style="s2">or so then you are beyond to your usual</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.119" end="00:38:17.289" style="s2">concepts that means you might not</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.609" end="00:38:22.150" style="s2">perceive an wild pick in the forest as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.289" end="00:38:24.130" style="s2">danger which in usually it is it is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.150" end="00:38:25.690" style="s2">a real danger right but people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.130" end="00:38:28.539" style="s2">anxious about them they think oh they</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.690" end="00:38:31.750" style="s2">are wild we are not wild so me we must</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.539" end="00:38:33.789" style="s2">must have been anxious in or we we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.750" end="00:38:35.829" style="s2">to be anxious about as a danger which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.789" end="00:38:38.049" style="s2">coming from their enemy so if you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.829" end="00:38:40.779" style="s2">under the influence of LSD for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.049" end="00:38:43.029" style="s2">and the wasp would sit down you know on</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.779" end="00:38:45.279" style="s2">your nose you are not anxious you would</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.029" end="00:38:47.500" style="s2">look it up and say oh an interesting MA</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.279" end="00:38:50.279" style="s2">hey man I&#39;ve never seen something so</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.500" end="00:38:53.559" style="s2">near and stuff like that so you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.279" end="00:38:55.630" style="s2">potentially in mutton much more respect</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.559" end="00:38:59.259" style="s2">of the other creatures because you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.630" end="00:39:01.809" style="s2">not determined to look out for your</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.259" end="00:39:04.150" style="s2">survival like is it a danger or can I</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.809" end="00:39:06.849" style="s2">can I eat it you know like these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.150" end="00:39:08.950" style="s2">categorizing is beyond your scope and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.849" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">that means you&#39;re looking much more at</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:16.359" style="s2">the animal life as it is represented in</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:19.329" style="s2">this species as it is in you and so you</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.359" end="00:39:21.910" style="s2">see much more commonalities in between</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.329" end="00:39:23.500" style="s2">the species and even might be with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.910" end="00:39:27.890" style="s2">plants and the mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.500" end="00:39:31.730" style="s2">you know then a dissimilarities or</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.890" end="00:39:33.859" style="s2">you you you&#39;re not into using the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.730" end="00:39:35.960" style="s2">your much more into perceiving the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.859" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">and you would see much more</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.960" end="00:39:40.999" style="s2">connectedness and commonalities that way</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:45.049" style="s2">and I think it is very important under</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.999" end="00:39:47.559" style="s2">research that we go beyond concepts even</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.049" end="00:39:50.299" style="s2">the only the neuropsychological</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.559" end="00:39:53.059" style="s2">experiments are much more to look at is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.299" end="00:39:56.259" style="s2">your intelligence score going down and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.059" end="00:39:58.700" style="s2">are you having less selective attention</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.259" end="00:40:00.680" style="s2">stuff like that you know but the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.700" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">interesting thing is that you get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.680" end="00:40:06.769" style="s2">selective attention because you get rid</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:10.099" style="s2">of your concepts so if you think oh this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.769" end="00:40:13.160" style="s2">this light there might be a car so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.099" end="00:40:15.410" style="s2">are looking at it coming and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.160" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">realize oh yeah it has a trunk it has</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.410" end="00:40:21.019" style="s2">another light and you know has has all</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:23.420" style="s2">these features so your perception is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.019" end="00:40:26.900" style="s2">kind of and your attention is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.420" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">guided by your concepts and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.900" end="00:40:32.089" style="s2">get rid of the concept you might also</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:34.910" style="s2">have another kind of attention which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.089" end="00:40:38.509" style="s2">much more broad in scope and takes much</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.910" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">more things into as significant as it</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.509" end="00:40:44.299" style="s2">would have been if you are tightened to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:47.029" style="s2">your concepts and you got a much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.299" end="00:40:49.880" style="s2">realm of evaluating things and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.029" end="00:40:51.619" style="s2">perceiving things so it would seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.880" end="00:40:53.180" style="s2">that there&#39;s a positive component to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.619" end="00:40:54.680" style="s2">that experience but also a negative</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.180" end="00:40:57.529" style="s2">component as well do you recognize</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.680" end="00:41:00.349" style="s2">positives and negatives with exactly for</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.529" end="00:41:03.109" style="s2">example there&#39;s one example which I like</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.349" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">to quote which was an experience my</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.109" end="00:41:08.660" style="s2">girlfriend had tens of years ago they</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:11.269" style="s2">were sitting together having an LSD trip</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.660" end="00:41:13.670" style="s2">I think about five people and one guy</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.269" end="00:41:17.480" style="s2">was playing a guitar an acoustic guitar</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.670" end="00:41:21.529" style="s2">and he didn&#39;t had a plectrum he used a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.480" end="00:41:26.329" style="s2">piece of an broken bottle right and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.529" end="00:41:30.300" style="s2">by chance he opened his artery in the in</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.329" end="00:41:33.330" style="s2">the forearm and the blood was</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.300" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">going flowing out there and it was an</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.330" end="00:41:38.040" style="s2">immediate life-threatening danger</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:40.200" style="s2">but the other people there looking at</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.040" end="00:41:42.930" style="s2">him and said oh man what a nice color</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.200" end="00:41:45.150" style="s2">what a nice thing is going on there you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.930" end="00:41:47.730" style="s2">know they were not into their concepts</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.150" end="00:41:50.460" style="s2">about dangerous and it&#39;s an artery and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.730" end="00:41:51.600" style="s2">that can be and so often so he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.460" end="00:41:55.020" style="s2">call up anybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.600" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">they didn&#39;t even help him for a while at</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.020" end="00:41:58.380" style="s2">a certain point they realize okay there</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.640" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">is something wrong and this guy hold his</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.380" end="00:42:02.760" style="s2">hand there and stuff and though they</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:05.100" style="s2">helped him and he was rescued but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.760" end="00:42:07.350" style="s2">first minutes they didn&#39;t realize what</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.100" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">what happened there yes and this can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.350" end="00:42:13.410" style="s2">dangerous dangerous but if you are in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">protected environment it shouldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.410" end="00:42:18.570" style="s2">problem because if you would just have</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:20.610" style="s2">matrices lying around and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.570" end="00:42:22.620" style="s2">that so I mean where should be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.610" end="00:42:25.320" style="s2">danger coming from right might come from</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.620" end="00:42:27.030" style="s2">your own inner space could be aggression</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.320" end="00:42:29.670" style="s2">or something like that but these are</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.030" end="00:42:33.150" style="s2">very rare occasions and you say show up</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.670" end="00:42:35.070" style="s2">in therapeutic setting settings you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.150" end="00:42:36.810" style="s2">easily handle these kind of things as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.070" end="00:42:39.060" style="s2">therapist tip yeah that&#39;s interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.810" end="00:42:41.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a good example of of a danger of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.060" end="00:42:45.270" style="s2">the sort of external world my suppose</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.870" end="00:42:51.810" style="s2">but what about when someone is looking</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.270" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">within and I guess the immediate well</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.810" end="00:42:55.860" style="s2">that the ordinary function of how you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:58.320" style="s2">relate to yourself is changed we talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.860" end="00:42:59.460" style="s2">about ego dissolution oh no I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.320" end="00:43:02.010" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of different ways to think</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.460" end="00:43:04.200" style="s2">about that one might be that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.010" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">almost hope there can be an almost total</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.200" end="00:43:12.360" style="s2">annihilation of what it is to usually</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:15.990" style="s2">relate yourself to yourself and and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.360" end="00:43:18.750" style="s2">but experience remains and and you will</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.990" end="00:43:21.660" style="s2">encounter images you know and I use that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.750" end="00:43:25.730" style="s2">term very broadly but could you talk to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.660" end="00:43:29.880" style="s2">perhaps what it is to gaze inward from</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.730" end="00:43:32.100" style="s2">that space where your ordinary look</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.880" end="00:43:34.290" style="s2">relation to concepts changes and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.100" end="00:43:35.550" style="s2">but also talk to what what the pitfall</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.290" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">might be like what is the resistance</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.550" end="00:43:38.640" style="s2">people have to looking within there</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:41.740" style="s2">because we know not everybody&#39;s art or</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.640" end="00:43:44.250" style="s2">big questions so the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.740" end="00:43:47.260" style="s2">these drugs were immediately called</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.250" end="00:43:49.990" style="s2">consciousness expanding by early</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.260" end="00:43:51.610" style="s2">researchers already and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.990" end="00:43:53.770" style="s2">from the shamans that they also have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.610" end="00:43:55.510" style="s2">kind of view on the substances like okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.770" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">the expanse your capacity to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.510" end="00:44:02.050" style="s2">yourself and it is not just that you put</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">your attention inward you could do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.050" end="00:44:06.250" style="s2">with meditation or other things too</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:09.490" style="s2">which might becomes a reputed in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.250" end="00:44:11.260" style="s2">sense to in some cases but what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.490" end="00:44:14.500" style="s2">difference is with the psychedelics to</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.260" end="00:44:17.410" style="s2">my eyes is that a psychedelic stimulate</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.500" end="00:44:19.780" style="s2">is a brain and that means that they even</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.410" end="00:44:22.180" style="s2">if there are some regions which are not</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.780" end="00:44:24.760" style="s2">having as much blood as usual and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.180" end="00:44:28.120" style="s2">irritates the brain to the general</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.760" end="00:44:31.540" style="s2">consensus is that you have an a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.120" end="00:44:34.540" style="s2">much increase of inner stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.540" end="00:44:36.250" style="s2">production and so all these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.540" end="00:44:38.320" style="s2">dreamlike states what your people</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.250" end="00:44:42.040" style="s2">experience are coming from these</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.320" end="00:44:45.640" style="s2">increase of production of inner stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.040" end="00:44:48.630" style="s2">and I think with this kind of day</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.640" end="00:44:51.220" style="s2">dreamlike flow of imagery and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.630" end="00:44:55.500" style="s2">experiences you can experience much more</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.220" end="00:44:57.640" style="s2">of yourself but but there is a certain a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.500" end="00:45:00.370" style="s2">threatening thing in that too because</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.640" end="00:45:02.500" style="s2">you don&#39;t know in which kind of corner</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.370" end="00:45:04.900" style="s2">of yourself you will end at last and</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.500" end="00:45:09.790" style="s2">what you will confront and this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.900" end="00:45:12.760" style="s2">especially what I like because then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.790" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">don&#39;t suggest so much to the patient</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.760" end="00:45:18.190" style="s2">it&#39;s more like a process which he is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:21.430" style="s2">doing by himself with some support of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.190" end="00:45:23.650" style="s2">you so if it comes to hypnosis for</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.430" end="00:45:26.350" style="s2">example you are much more suggestive you</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.650" end="00:45:29.980" style="s2">are much more potentially manipulative</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.350" end="00:45:32.410" style="s2">and your concepts guides the experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.980" end="00:45:35.110" style="s2">stuff like that and with psycholytic</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.410" end="00:45:37.510" style="s2">syrup or psychedelic therapy you are not</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.110" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">really impregnating the person and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.510" end="00:45:42.460" style="s2">you&#39;re not really guiding you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:44.740" style="s2">kind of a moderator you were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.460" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">helper in some cases you might say okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.740" end="00:45:50.380" style="s2">it&#39;s better if you stay on your mattress</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:52.740" style="s2">if it&#39;s a person is tending to stand up</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.380" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">in a dysfunctional fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.740" end="00:45:57.900" style="s2">you happen and in other things you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:46:00.630" style="s2">converse with him you can calm him down</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.900" end="00:46:03.180" style="s2">stuff like that but let the inner</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.630" end="00:46:05.550" style="s2">process happen this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.180" end="00:46:09.000" style="s2">paradigm in psycho lytic and psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.550" end="00:46:11.490" style="s2">therapy so don&#39;t intervene as much and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.000" end="00:46:14.460" style="s2">this is very much what I like about this</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.490" end="00:46:18.360" style="s2">kind of a therapeutic work that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.460" end="00:46:19.800" style="s2">healing is coming from within I even</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.360" end="00:46:21.780" style="s2">called it that way the healing from</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.800" end="00:46:24.270" style="s2">coming from within you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.780" end="00:46:27.990" style="s2">means you&#39;re just a moderator this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.270" end="00:46:29.880" style="s2">also where you can see there is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.990" end="00:46:33.930" style="s2">of distinction between the psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.880" end="00:46:36.690" style="s2">psychedelic therapist one try to tend to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.930" end="00:46:39.630" style="s2">further their narcissism means</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.690" end="00:46:41.850" style="s2">oh I&#39;m the healer I&#39;m the guy who is</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.630" end="00:46:44.400" style="s2">directing the experience I am the guy</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.850" end="00:46:47.130" style="s2">who is giving the substances I&#39;m see my</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">God and stuff like that and the others</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.130" end="00:46:53.160" style="s2">become through experience with a service</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:56.130" style="s2">sarap utak work they become more and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.160" end="00:47:00.090" style="s2">more humble and realize that the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.130" end="00:47:03.420" style="s2">heal mainly heal themselves and we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.090" end="00:47:05.460" style="s2">just moderating self-healing capacities</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.420" end="00:47:10.140" style="s2">yes very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.460" end="00:47:13.290" style="s2">so is it part of your role to sit in on</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.140" end="00:47:15.869" style="s2">the administration of psycho lytic</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.290" end="00:47:18.540" style="s2">therapy yeah I have done that quite a</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.869" end="00:47:21.510" style="s2">lot and I&#39;m still doing it occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.540" end="00:47:25.410" style="s2">but we not we are now approaching the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.510" end="00:47:28.590" style="s2">stage of the psychedelic revival where</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.410" end="00:47:31.020" style="s2">we are doing a therapeutic studies and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.590" end="00:47:34.590" style="s2">so in the near future we will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.020" end="00:47:36.600" style="s2">sit again in legal settings but I have</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.590" end="00:47:39.270" style="s2">done that already with sons Colonna and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.600" end="00:47:44.369" style="s2">with Swiss guys which has permit in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.270" end="00:47:46.530" style="s2">early 1990s and so I have a lot gathered</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.369" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">a lot of experience with sitting with</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.530" end="00:47:49.950" style="s2">patience yes yes that&#39;s really very</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:52.859" style="s2">interesting have you been</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.950" end="00:47:56.280" style="s2">have you been influenced a tool by Stan</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.859" end="00:47:58.320" style="s2">graphs work yeah definitely so</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.280" end="00:48:00.750" style="s2">especially in the beginning because it</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.320" end="00:48:03.980" style="s2">was giving you a more broader outlook on</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.750" end="00:48:07.849" style="s2">the experiences you can get</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.980" end="00:48:10.520" style="s2">in but in retrospect I would say it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.849" end="00:48:13.210" style="s2">already there by other researchers but</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.520" end="00:48:17.240" style="s2">much more dispersed in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.210" end="00:48:20.570" style="s2">and so he putted it together and he also</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.240" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">came from the psycholytic approach which</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.570" end="00:48:26.540" style="s2">was more inspired by psychoanalysis and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:28.910" style="s2">lower dosages in serial sessions and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.540" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">we had very much knowledge of both</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.910" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">approaches the psychedelic approach with</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:36.320" style="s2">one or two doses and high high doses and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:38.750" style="s2">inducing life transforming mystical</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.320" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">experiences and as well as with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.750" end="00:48:44.420" style="s2">psycholytic approach he also was ideal</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:47.210" style="s2">to give us a more broader picture of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.420" end="00:48:49.670" style="s2">psychedelic or cytolytic Serra poetic</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.210" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">processes because he was also part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.670" end="00:48:54.950" style="s2">two cultures the American culture and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:57.230" style="s2">the Czech culture of the European</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.950" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">culture in essence and so therefore he</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.230" end="00:49:02.540" style="s2">was the ideal guy to put all that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.359" end="00:49:04.910" style="s2">together he had also a very good</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.540" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">education in the theory of science yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.910" end="00:49:11.540" style="s2">and so but I have to confess it as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">later a work of him I was not as much</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.540" end="00:49:16.339" style="s2">impressed by but this is not just my</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">personal thing I think the first work</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.339" end="00:49:20.890" style="s2">was most important to lay the groundwork</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:23.420" style="s2">for something like transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.890" end="00:49:25.940" style="s2">psychology and respecting much more</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.420" end="00:49:28.609" style="s2">these life transforming aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.940" end="00:49:31.819" style="s2">psychedelic experience okay so that book</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.609" end="00:49:33.260" style="s2">his first great major work is realms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.819" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">the human unconscious that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.260" end="00:49:36.589" style="s2">yeah it is it is a really quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:39.339" style="s2">remarkable book actually for people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.589" end="00:49:43.310" style="s2">are curious about the LSD experience</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.339" end="00:49:45.890" style="s2">there&#39;s quite remarkable accounts of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.310" end="00:49:49.220" style="s2">some of his patients and also a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.890" end="00:49:51.859" style="s2">detailed analysis of the various stages</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.220" end="00:49:54.349" style="s2">or classes of kinds of experience as he</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.859" end="00:49:56.690" style="s2">sees them as a problem for before was</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.349" end="00:49:58.849" style="s2">that a lot of the psychiatrist and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.690" end="00:50:00.980" style="s2">psychotherapist we&#39;re kind of shy to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.849" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">talk about these experiences even and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.980" end="00:50:07.460" style="s2">they were not able to conceptualize them</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:10.849" style="s2">and not as comprehensively as a stan has</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.460" end="00:50:14.010" style="s2">done that and therefore he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.849" end="00:50:17.430" style="s2">blocks away for these</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.010" end="00:50:22.040" style="s2">kind of psychological experiences to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.430" end="00:50:26.460" style="s2">respected not be called psychotic or</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.040" end="00:50:29.400" style="s2">strange or alien or whatever and we also</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.460" end="00:50:31.530" style="s2">had mahants calendar for example was</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.400" end="00:50:34.650" style="s2">much more technical in his descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.530" end="00:50:37.500" style="s2">and he in his letter yes he told me he</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.650" end="00:50:40.590" style="s2">had kind of underestimated the value of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.500" end="00:50:42.570" style="s2">this more transpersonal like or mystical</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.590" end="00:50:45.240" style="s2">and whatever kind of experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.570" end="00:50:47.100" style="s2">they are therapeutically merciful as we</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.240" end="00:50:49.619" style="s2">see right now with all the new trials</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.100" end="00:50:51.690" style="s2">yes very interesting ok so I know our</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.619" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">time is drawing to a close together</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.690" end="00:50:55.230" style="s2">which is a which is a shame from my</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:58.859" style="s2">perspective means I don&#39;t think I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.230" end="00:51:00.300" style="s2">ever have a finite set of questions to</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.859" end="00:51:02.430" style="s2">ask you there would always be more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.300" end="00:51:03.570" style="s2">been really enjoyable talking to you so</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.430" end="00:51:05.010" style="s2">I&#39;m just rying to think of ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.570" end="00:51:08.010" style="s2">could really provide value to people</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.010" end="00:51:10.200" style="s2">here one would be to ask you what you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.010" end="00:51:13.830" style="s2">would recommend for people to read or</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.200" end="00:51:15.900" style="s2">engage with that you think gives the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.830" end="00:51:17.070" style="s2">best introduction to but then moving</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.900" end="00:51:19.770" style="s2">towards the potential for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.070" end="00:51:22.830" style="s2">comprehensive understanding of how to</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.770" end="00:51:24.780" style="s2">understand perhaps modern psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.830" end="00:51:28.020" style="s2">psychology but and where that intersects</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.780" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">with psychedelics yeah and so right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.020" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">there&#39;s not so much out there which</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:34.740" style="s2">concert conceptualizes these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:36.690" style="s2">relationships and so on and we also have</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.740" end="00:51:39.150" style="s2">to realize that stan grof is out of</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.690" end="00:51:41.940" style="s2">science since 40 years you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.150" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">more into conceptualizing things but</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.940" end="00:51:48.300" style="s2">with not very much scientific foundation</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:50.460" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s because of his huge</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.300" end="00:51:52.920" style="s2">experience he can conceptualize things</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.460" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">without his scientific base of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.920" end="00:51:57.930" style="s2">and so therefore he can&#39;t be recruited</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">for that purpose and there are not so</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.930" end="00:52:02.400" style="s2">much people in the field right now as</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:05.310" style="s2">far as I can see which might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.400" end="00:52:08.100" style="s2">do that and so we were it will be an</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.310" end="00:52:10.530" style="s2">interesting time to see how psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.100" end="00:52:14.130" style="s2">might integrate these new approaches</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.530" end="00:52:16.890" style="s2">which are in fact very old because we</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.130" end="00:52:19.500" style="s2">were in charge of a cathartic procedures</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.890" end="00:52:20.910" style="s2">in the former times hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.500" end="00:52:23.609" style="s2">they used that much more in</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.910" end="00:52:26.560" style="s2">psychotherapy and psychiatry but they</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.609" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">they changed their mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.560" end="00:52:32.350" style="s2">have less feelings as our culture tends</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:34.450" style="s2">to be to be bomb be more rational to</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.350" end="00:52:37.150" style="s2">have less feelings and for example</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.450" end="00:52:39.310" style="s2">psychoanalysis was gone away from</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.150" end="00:52:43.780" style="s2">effectivity and up reaction and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.310" end="00:52:46.840" style="s2">catharsis because of not - of not coming</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.780" end="00:52:49.450" style="s2">to near to the patient to become too</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.840" end="00:52:52.390" style="s2">empathic which might be fall in love at</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.450" end="00:52:55.150" style="s2">last these kind of things so they stayed</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.390" end="00:52:58.180" style="s2">away from a pre action and more feelings</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.150" end="00:53:01.810" style="s2">and I think that we there will be also</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.180" end="00:53:05.460" style="s2">an revival of feelings as healing powers</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.810" end="00:53:09.010" style="s2">in psychiatry and it is not so easy to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.460" end="00:53:13.030" style="s2">educate these this how should I say</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.010" end="00:53:16.810" style="s2">old-fashioned or the psychiatrists of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.030" end="00:53:19.600" style="s2">today to educate them to allow more</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.810" end="00:53:21.670" style="s2">feelings to allow more openness about</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.600" end="00:53:23.890" style="s2">the inner processes which might be</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.670" end="00:53:26.460" style="s2">activated by psychedelic drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.890" end="00:53:29.380" style="s2">therefore I think there is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.460" end="00:53:30.970" style="s2">skepticism which we will confront in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.380" end="00:53:33.220" style="s2">future even if some people are</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.970" end="00:53:35.890" style="s2">interested in these kind of things but</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.220" end="00:53:38.070" style="s2">there is a lot of resistance we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.890" end="00:53:41.590" style="s2">go over in the future</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.070" end="00:53:43.780" style="s2">ok ok so perhaps you might like to say a</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.590" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">few words about your upcoming book I</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.780" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">know this conversation will be released</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:50.950" style="s2">a route well it will be released at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:54.540" style="s2">appropriate time for a release of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.950" end="00:53:58.270" style="s2">book so who should be interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.540" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">what&#39;s its name and yeah and it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.270" end="00:54:02.770" style="s2">to say right now called the science of</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:04.750" style="s2">micro dosing that&#39;s a book about micro</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.770" end="00:54:07.720" style="s2">dosing and it gives you an impressive</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.750" end="00:54:10.090" style="s2">overview about all we know about because</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.720" end="00:54:12.430" style="s2">I&#39;m you I shouldn&#39;t say that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.090" end="00:54:14.350" style="s2">true I&#39;m one of the leading experts in</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.430" end="00:54:15.970" style="s2">respect to the pharmacology of LSD I</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.350" end="00:54:18.280" style="s2">have written a book with Oxford</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.970" end="00:54:20.980" style="s2">University Press about the pharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.280" end="00:54:22.840" style="s2">of LSD and I really comprehensively know</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.980" end="00:54:25.270" style="s2">all the literature about it and all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.840" end="00:54:27.430" style="s2">facts and so therefore it might be</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.270" end="00:54:30.460" style="s2">interesting especially for scientists</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.430" end="00:54:32.890" style="s2">and for the serious potential micro</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.460" end="00:54:35.020" style="s2">doses to know about the history because</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.890" end="00:54:38.080" style="s2">I&#39;m a historian - I&#39;m into these</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.020" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">elaborating these methods - but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.080" end="00:54:42.040" style="s2">into pharmacology and</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:44.350" style="s2">looking up all these little tiny studies</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.040" end="00:54:47.500" style="s2">which have been done in the past and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.350" end="00:54:49.320" style="s2">also can contextualize that with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.500" end="00:54:52.750" style="s2">recent knowledge what we gained about</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.320" end="00:54:55.140" style="s2">LSD I might also mention that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.750" end="00:54:58.180" style="s2">recently founded the International</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.140" end="00:55:00.970" style="s2">medical psychological society for</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.180" end="00:55:05.970" style="s2">substance assisted psychotherapy which</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.970" end="00:55:09.340" style="s2">will be an institution meant to to</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.970" end="00:55:11.890" style="s2">evaluate a therapeutic procedures to</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.340" end="00:55:14.860" style="s2">provide guidelines to do Quality</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.890" end="00:55:17.230" style="s2">Assurance procedures and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.860" end="00:55:21.640" style="s2">to find consensus about certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.230" end="00:55:23.740" style="s2">therapeutic procedures and processes on</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.640" end="00:55:26.140" style="s2">an international level so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.740" end="00:55:28.780" style="s2">kind of setting the standards and norms</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.140" end="00:55:30.820" style="s2">we have to take care of that because</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.780" end="00:55:32.800" style="s2">otherwise we will not be established and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.820" end="00:55:34.390" style="s2">not come through in the established</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.800" end="00:55:38.820" style="s2">communities of psychiatrists and</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.390" end="00:55:42.430" style="s2">psychologists and so this would be an</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.820" end="00:55:44.200" style="s2">important step and in connection to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.430" end="00:55:46.720" style="s2">I might mention that I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.200" end="00:55:49.240" style="s2">writing another book right now which</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.720" end="00:55:52.780" style="s2">will be or which is intended to be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.240" end="00:55:55.440" style="s2">comprehensive textbook about psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.780" end="00:55:58.450" style="s2">and psychedelic therapy and sorting all</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.440" end="00:56:00.810" style="s2">these effects together even the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.450" end="00:56:03.340" style="s2">modern approaches and the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.810" end="00:56:06.180" style="s2">neurobiology and so on and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.340" end="00:56:08.530" style="s2">this is because of having a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.180" end="00:56:11.170" style="s2">multidisciplinary approach from my way</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.530" end="00:56:13.630" style="s2">what I studied from social science to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.170" end="00:56:17.260" style="s2">philosophy to psychology and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.630" end="00:56:19.510" style="s2">medicine and neurobiology so it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.260" end="00:56:23.230" style="s2">sometimes good if you have one person</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.510" end="00:56:25.870" style="s2">kind of sorry knowing everything and put</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.230" end="00:56:28.570" style="s2">it together in a thing with what is kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.870" end="00:56:32.020" style="s2">of straightforward and not having five</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.570" end="00:56:34.900" style="s2">contributions where you replicate parts</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.020" end="00:56:39.480" style="s2">here and as you repeat that there and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.900" end="00:56:42.730" style="s2">on it has to be more kind of out of one</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.480" end="00:56:44.320" style="s2">feather so you say no beautiful that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.730" end="00:56:45.520" style="s2">that&#39;s super interesting I look forward</p>
