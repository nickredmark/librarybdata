<p begin="00:05:35.060" end="00:05:42.770" style="s2">enterprises so I am I&#39;m curious to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.390" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">how you got to this point in your life</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.770" end="00:05:50.090" style="s2">how you how you decided that thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:52.520" style="s2">about this biggest you know this</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.090" end="00:05:53.980" style="s2">big-picture stuff was important to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.520" end="00:06:00.380" style="s2">and why it became like personally</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.980" end="00:06:02.150" style="s2">significant to your work mm-hmm I had no</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.380" end="00:06:03.410" style="s2">it&#39;s great it&#39;s great to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.150" end="00:06:07.730" style="s2">understand where people are coming from</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.410" end="00:06:10.130" style="s2">into this I had a fortunate early</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.730" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">exposure so I grew up on the work of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.130" end="00:06:14.990" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:18.890" style="s2">science and systems theory and futurists</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.990" end="00:06:21.920" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of always been the come</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.890" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">from and then fairly early on I got into</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.920" end="00:06:27.230" style="s2">activism work and it started with animal</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:30.350" style="s2">rights work and then environmental work</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.230" end="00:06:32.810" style="s2">and then social dynamics work and so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.350" end="00:06:34.520" style="s2">was working with different NGOs that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.810" end="00:06:36.680" style="s2">know starting really young like nine</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.520" end="00:06:39.370" style="s2">years old homeschooled that got to be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.680" end="00:06:41.990" style="s2">huge part of the home schooling and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.370" end="00:06:44.270" style="s2">having some Systems Theory background</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.990" end="00:06:45.980" style="s2">already I was able to see that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.270" end="00:06:47.450" style="s2">causes of the issues weren&#39;t being well</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.980" end="00:06:48.770" style="s2">addressed in the interconnection of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.450" end="00:06:50.120" style="s2">issues and the generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.770" end="00:06:52.910" style="s2">weren&#39;t being well addressed and as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.120" end="00:06:55.130" style="s2">result the really well intentioned and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.910" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">very hard earned successes largely</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.130" end="00:07:00.010" style="s2">displaced problems elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">there were externalities even to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.010" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">positive projects that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.180" end="00:07:07.240" style="s2">solve externalities</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:09.340" style="s2">and so you know where we would think of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.240" end="00:07:10.840" style="s2">something like the death of elephants</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.340" end="00:07:12.640" style="s2">has an externality of an incentive</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.840" end="00:07:13.530" style="s2">system that makes their tusks worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.640" end="00:07:15.550" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.530" end="00:07:17.380" style="s2">there was a project that I was working</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.550" end="00:07:19.180" style="s2">on to try and protect elephants had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.380" end="00:07:20.530" style="s2">Preserve Greenpeace and World Wildlife</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.180" end="00:07:22.870" style="s2">Federation a number of groups were</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.530" end="00:07:24.940" style="s2">working on it and the solution was</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.870" end="00:07:27.750" style="s2">bigger fences around the preserve and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.940" end="00:07:29.890" style="s2">harsher sentencing for poachers and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.750" end="00:07:31.870" style="s2">after a tremendous amount of work that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.890" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">happened and it actually succeeded in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.870" end="00:07:35.740" style="s2">terms of keeping poachers from poaching</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.550" end="00:07:37.510" style="s2">elephants in that area it of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.740" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t address the poverty of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.510" end="00:07:43.540" style="s2">people who had really no other solutions</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:46.090" style="s2">at all it didn&#39;t address the world view</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.540" end="00:07:47.890" style="s2">towards animals at all as a whole the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.090" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">black market on various other animals it</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.890" end="00:07:52.660" style="s2">didn&#39;t address the macroeconomic system</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:54.100" style="s2">that creates poverty inexorably it</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.660" end="00:07:56.350" style="s2">didn&#39;t address any of those things so</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.100" end="00:07:57.669" style="s2">the same group of poachers moved to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.350" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">start hunting the mountain gorillas in</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.669" end="00:08:01.240" style="s2">the white rhino and because I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:03.850" style="s2">working on enough different projects I</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.240" end="00:08:06.010" style="s2">got to see those movements and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.850" end="00:08:08.680" style="s2">there was an existential devastation</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.010" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">that started it started with seeing all</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.680" end="00:08:13.660" style="s2">of the suffering that humans were</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:16.870" style="s2">inducing unnecessarily on themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.660" end="00:08:18.220" style="s2">each other and the world and then at</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.870" end="00:08:19.570" style="s2">least there was some hope that there</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.220" end="00:08:21.790" style="s2">were projects working to resolve these</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.570" end="00:08:23.200" style="s2">when it became clear that the projects</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.790" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">working to resolve them weren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.200" end="00:08:26.440" style="s2">resolving them I started to look deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:29.140" style="s2">and say where else is that happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.440" end="00:08:31.000" style="s2">where the other environmental project so</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.140" end="00:08:32.979" style="s2">we work really hard to prevent a dam</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.000" end="00:08:34.750" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna have ecological catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.979" end="00:08:36.789" style="s2">but then that means that the energy from</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.750" end="00:08:38.860" style="s2">the dam doesn&#39;t come in so the coal</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.789" end="00:08:41.020" style="s2">plant comes in or you know like there</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.860" end="00:08:44.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a deep enough focus kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.020" end="00:08:47.890" style="s2">anywhere at how do we actually do</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.610" end="00:08:50.620" style="s2">complex system problem-solving and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.890" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">design and management we only knew how</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.620" end="00:08:54.100" style="s2">to do simple systems or complicated</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:56.140" style="s2">systems and we&#39;re doing complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.100" end="00:08:59.290" style="s2">and the toolkit was obviously broken</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:09:01.930" style="s2">right and so as I started diving in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.290" end="00:09:05.410" style="s2">deeper they&#39;re kind of early in</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.930" end="00:09:07.270" style="s2">teenagehood I saw that the trends that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.410" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">were happening in terms of biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.270" end="00:09:13.930" style="s2">loss and in terms of peak resource use</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.670" style="s2">with nitrogen phosphorus etc if we just</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.930" end="00:09:16.700" style="s2">continued those curves of their current</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.670" end="00:09:18.350" style="s2">rate</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.700" end="00:09:21.080" style="s2">while also looking at the positive</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.350" end="00:09:23.240" style="s2">curves of increase in solar or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.080" end="00:09:26.300" style="s2">kind of positive curves we only got to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">an adequate evolutionary place to deal</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.300" end="00:09:32.180" style="s2">with the negative curves after</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:34.400" style="s2">extinction and so the the forecast you</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.180" end="00:09:36.070" style="s2">know and this was basic methods of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.400" end="00:09:42.260" style="s2">forecasting but the forecast was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.070" end="00:09:44.690" style="s2">inexorable self-determination and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.260" end="00:09:46.490" style="s2">then I&#39;m thinking not only of you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.690" end="00:09:48.070" style="s2">unnecessary human induced suffering in</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.490" end="00:09:52.940" style="s2">the failure of the solutions but</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.070" end="00:09:56.030" style="s2">existential risk writ large and so of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.940" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">course the idea of succeeding at some</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.030" end="00:10:01.790" style="s2">partial set was broken right the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:03.770" style="s2">that I can have success in my personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.790" end="00:10:05.690" style="s2">life working on some of the problems and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.770" end="00:10:06.980" style="s2">other ones are continuing to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.690" end="00:10:08.990" style="s2">I know about them I know what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.980" end="00:10:11.690" style="s2">in a factory farm right I know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.990" end="00:10:14.120" style="s2">like in in extreme poverty but I can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.690" end="00:10:16.520" style="s2">stoked because I&#39;m succeeding in some</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.120" end="00:10:18.350" style="s2">small area I can only be stoked if I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.520" end="00:10:20.020" style="s2">disconnect my empathy from what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.350" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">actually going on which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.020" end="00:10:25.190" style="s2">being a psychopath right some level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:27.950" style="s2">abstract psychopathy yeah cognizant is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.190" end="00:10:31.510" style="s2">is a characteristic of the modern human</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.950" end="00:10:35.080" style="s2">I think it&#39;s like it&#39;s necessary it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.510" end="00:10:37.460" style="s2">because we have a system where</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.080" end="00:10:38.510" style="s2">structural violence and externality are</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.460" end="00:10:40.580" style="s2">implicit throughout the system</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.510" end="00:10:40.850" style="s2">completely so participation with it at</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.580" end="00:10:42.740" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.850" end="00:10:46.910" style="s2">requires participation with that right</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.740" end="00:10:48.410" style="s2">and so it was clear that there were no</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.910" end="00:10:51.770" style="s2">models of success that could actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.410" end="00:10:53.630" style="s2">work for me and that killing myself to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.770" end="00:10:56.270" style="s2">get off of the kind of like a crazy bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.630" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">of of violence didn&#39;t help anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.270" end="00:10:59.960" style="s2">and so the only thing was is there a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:03.020" style="s2">solution to all of this that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.960" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">viable and it was clear that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.020" end="00:11:06.200" style="s2">going to be more of the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:09.530" style="s2">we were already doing that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.200" end="00:11:11.630" style="s2">working it was going to be you know for</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.530" end="00:11:13.490" style="s2">the crew got in the for-profit world</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.630" end="00:11:14.990" style="s2">something like 70 trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.490" end="00:11:17.090" style="s2">trading hands every day that is almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.990" end="00:11:22.250" style="s2">all externalizing harm somewhere along a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.090" end="00:11:23.870" style="s2">supply chain then if if I was to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.250" end="00:11:25.460" style="s2">allocate a billion nonprofit dollars</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.870" end="00:11:27.320" style="s2">really intelligently per day I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.460" end="00:11:29.150" style="s2">five or six orders of magnitude too</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.320" end="00:11:30.259" style="s2">small in my effect how do we we have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.150" end="00:11:32.299" style="s2">system where human</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.259" end="00:11:34.129" style="s2">agency has been predisposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.299" end="00:11:35.899" style="s2">directly and indirectly harm causing how</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.129" end="00:11:39.410" style="s2">do we change that generator function at</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.899" end="00:11:41.749" style="s2">scale we&#39;re all human agency is disposed</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.410" end="00:11:44.119" style="s2">by the nature of the system to be on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.749" end="00:11:45.949" style="s2">positive and that if you do that you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.119" end="00:11:47.689" style="s2">get off of the current curves and have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.949" end="00:11:49.759" style="s2">discrete nonlinear phase shift which</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.689" end="00:11:51.709" style="s2">evolution does single cell to multi cell</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.759" end="00:11:53.779" style="s2">you know etc and it was clear that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.709" end="00:11:55.939" style="s2">nothing less than a discrete nonlinear</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.779" end="00:11:57.439" style="s2">phase shift was adequate and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.939" end="00:12:00.019" style="s2">know the rest of the process has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.439" end="00:12:02.209" style="s2">what are the necessary and sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.019" end="00:12:04.789" style="s2">criteria of the post transition world</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.209" end="00:12:08.779" style="s2">and how do we actually support that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.789" end="00:12:10.579" style="s2">emergence yeah so this is around what</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.779" end="00:12:12.649" style="s2">time are you starting to think this way</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.579" end="00:12:16.100" style="s2">like how long have you been in this part</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.649" end="00:12:18.769" style="s2">in in the pocket with this one the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.100" end="00:12:21.350" style="s2">assessment of definitely self</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.769" end="00:12:23.089" style="s2">terminating on the current path was a</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.089" end="00:12:28.539" style="s2">and so yeah because there&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.549" end="00:12:30.619" style="s2">thing about you know the neglect in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.539" end="00:12:32.569" style="s2">traditional presentation our mutual</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.619" end="00:12:35.929" style="s2">friend Bruce Damer talks about how he</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.269" end="00:12:58.069" style="s2">you know a lot of this stuff was absurd</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.829" end="00:13:01.459" style="s2">but that the timing of those predictions</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.069" end="00:13:03.949" style="s2">aside you&#39;re looking at the collapse of</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.850" end="00:13:38.179" style="s2">whatever so seeing it this way knowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:40.639" style="s2">that there has to be this discrete jump</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.179" end="00:13:41.900" style="s2">and and to be clear like this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.639" end="00:13:44.060" style="s2">thing does</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.900" end="00:13:46.220" style="s2">happen it&#39;s not like you said just the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.060" end="00:13:49.010" style="s2">transformation and individuality from</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.220" end="00:13:51.890" style="s2">like individual cells to a multicellular</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.010" end="00:13:55.670" style="s2">organism but it&#39;s even you see it even</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.890" end="00:13:59.900" style="s2">within human culture where we start to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.670" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">organize a larger level and so the units</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.900" end="00:14:04.700" style="s2">of human society that were at once the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">the major organizing unit like the city</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.700" end="00:14:10.339" style="s2">becomes an organ in the body of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:12.080" style="s2">something larger so like I guess this</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.339" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">might just be a tangent but it</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.080" end="00:14:16.910" style="s2">let&#39;s write it and see where it takes us</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:21.460" style="s2">how do you understand your work as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.910" end="00:14:25.250" style="s2">junior process or an organ within a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.460" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">superior process or super organism in</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.250" end="00:14:30.920" style="s2">this particular thing like is that a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:32.810" style="s2">framing metaphor that you use is this</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.920" end="00:14:35.029" style="s2">how you understand the nature of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.810" end="00:14:38.210" style="s2">shift and like in that sense like what</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.029" end="00:14:40.970" style="s2">kind of rolled you and and the work that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.210" end="00:14:43.100" style="s2">you&#39;re doing fit into that so if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.970" end="00:14:46.010" style="s2">think about that question in light of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.100" end="00:14:51.170" style="s2">the name of this podcast future fossils</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.010" end="00:14:52.610" style="s2">right so we think back about all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.170" end="00:14:54.980" style="s2">civilizations that we know of in</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.610" end="00:14:57.350" style="s2">recorded history and one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.980" end="00:15:01.670" style="s2">valuable insights is that they all ended</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.350" end="00:15:04.640" style="s2">right and so if we read Joseph Tainter</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.670" end="00:15:07.820" style="s2">in the collapse of complex societies we</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.640" end="00:15:09.440" style="s2">see certain patterns of and in their</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.820" end="00:15:10.910" style="s2">updates to that work since then but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.440" end="00:15:13.490" style="s2">see certain patterns of how collapse</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.910" end="00:15:16.310" style="s2">occurs but whether we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.490" end="00:15:18.350" style="s2">Sumeria or Mesopotamia or the Byzantine</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.310" end="00:15:21.290" style="s2">Empire or Rome like none of them exist</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.350" end="00:15:25.070" style="s2">anymore and the thing and there were</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.290" end="00:15:26.900" style="s2">actually elements of unsustainability in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.070" end="00:15:30.290" style="s2">their own growth patterns that led to</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.900" end="00:15:32.060" style="s2">their self termination even if there was</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.290" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">an attack from outside it was usually</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.060" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">after there was increasing decoherence</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:37.010" style="s2">where they weren&#39;t able to have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:40.459" style="s2">military capacity that they previously</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.010" end="00:15:42.260" style="s2">had etc but they were all local</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.459" end="00:15:43.730" style="s2">collapses right the collapse of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.260" end="00:15:46.040" style="s2">empires because it was wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.730" end="00:15:49.010" style="s2">collapse of it everything and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.040" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">in a unique position now where the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.010" end="00:15:50.600" style="s2">meat like the thing that we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:52.459" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.600" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">and collapse is a fully globalized</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.459" end="00:15:59.449" style="s2">civilization and the collapses are all</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">between catastrophic and existential</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.449" end="00:16:03.500" style="s2">right the collapse scenarios and we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:06.920" style="s2">currently on the path for collapse</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.500" end="00:16:08.389" style="s2">scenario z&#39; and so when and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.920" end="00:16:10.130" style="s2">important to get that many of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.389" end="00:16:11.420" style="s2">early cultures actually did ruin their</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.130" end="00:16:13.009" style="s2">environment they had unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.420" end="00:16:14.810" style="s2">agriculture that desertified the area</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.009" end="00:16:17.089" style="s2">and then people starved right but it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.810" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t ruin the life-support capacities</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.089" end="00:16:22.009" style="s2">of the planet writ large right which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:23.420" style="s2">very different and a lot of them killed</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.009" end="00:16:25.009" style="s2">each other militarily but they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.420" end="00:16:28.610" style="s2">have nukes that could leave nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.009" end="00:16:31.370" style="s2">winter for a long time and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.610" end="00:16:33.170" style="s2">think about the evolution of history</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.370" end="00:16:34.699" style="s2">from a game theoretic perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.170" end="00:16:37.790" style="s2">you think of it as the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.699" end="00:16:40.730" style="s2">power and win-lose games and so you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.790" end="00:16:42.230" style="s2">tribes that so long as the resource is</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.730" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">plentiful relative to the population</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.230" end="00:16:46.160" style="s2">don&#39;t bother killing each other and as</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:47.930" style="s2">soon as the population outstrips the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.160" end="00:16:50.149" style="s2">resource they&#39;re competing implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.930" end="00:16:53.000" style="s2">for scarce resource it becomes important</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.149" end="00:16:54.769" style="s2">to then compete explicitly and so then</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.000" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">one tribe kills the other one that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.769" end="00:16:58.519" style="s2">the river front now they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:16:59.810" style="s2">competitor for the same resource and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.519" end="00:17:02.300" style="s2">they have the river front life is better</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.810" end="00:17:04.039" style="s2">for them now all the other tribes who</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.300" end="00:17:05.900" style="s2">didn&#39;t do that have to do that by</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.039" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">default or they&#39;re going to die from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.900" end="00:17:10.909" style="s2">ones who learned to start doing military</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">strategy as a method of you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.909" end="00:17:15.589" style="s2">advancing and so then you have a big</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:16.939" style="s2">tribe little tribes can&#39;t compete so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.589" end="00:17:19.189" style="s2">you have them band together and now you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.939" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">get groups of tribes and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.189" end="00:17:22.039" style="s2">this continues to happen and then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:23.179" style="s2">get villages and kingdoms and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.039" end="00:17:25.959" style="s2">nation-states and global economic</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.179" end="00:17:28.940" style="s2">trading bloc&#39;s and they increase their</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.959" end="00:17:31.220" style="s2">competitive power in a win-lose game on</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.940" end="00:17:34.669" style="s2">all sides and so that means military</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.220" end="00:17:36.260" style="s2">power goes up it means the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.669" end="00:17:38.929" style="s2">extract scarce resource from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.260" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">environment including unsustainably</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.929" end="00:17:43.429" style="s2">faster than it can reproduce and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:44.990" style="s2">increase their propaganda capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.429" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">dis inform the other side and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.990" end="00:17:49.580" style="s2">have more adherents on their side you</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:52.429" style="s2">when you add the hockey stick part of an</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.580" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">exponential tech curve to that win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.429" end="00:17:58.490" style="s2">game theoretic dynamic and you get</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.529" end="00:19:56.039" style="s2">generations to be able to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.500" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">fossils of this culture if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.039" end="00:20:00.870" style="s2">actually make this phase shift up and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:02.789" style="s2">we do they won&#39;t have to be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.870" end="00:20:04.380" style="s2">fossils because we will actually get</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.789" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">down intergenerational knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.380" end="00:20:08.940" style="s2">transfer</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">so we&#39;ve already a unique point in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.940" end="00:20:13.830" style="s2">whole historical curve right now so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:16.230" style="s2">happen to be reading</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.830" end="00:20:20.279" style="s2">two books that you alluded to very</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.230" end="00:20:23.159" style="s2">strongly in this this last bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.279" end="00:20:25.110" style="s2">Timothy Morton&#39;s hyper objects if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.159" end="00:20:26.490" style="s2">familiar with this one philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.110" end="00:20:29.750" style="s2">ecology after the end of the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.490" end="00:20:33.299" style="s2">talking about the influence of this this</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.750" end="00:20:36.419" style="s2">these complex and distributed phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.299" end="00:20:37.980" style="s2">that we have to take is real and like</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.419" end="00:20:39.960" style="s2">you know a phenomenon like global</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.980" end="00:20:42.630" style="s2">warming and then the other one is James</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.960" end="00:20:45.539" style="s2">P cars&#39; is finite and infinite games and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.630" end="00:20:47.960" style="s2">this this is exactly a vision of life as</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.539" end="00:20:54.389" style="s2">play in possibility the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.960" end="00:20:55.950" style="s2">we we transit here if successful it</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.389" end="00:21:00.090" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;re saying we transit</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.950" end="00:21:04.019" style="s2">from that finite zero sum type thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.090" end="00:21:05.639" style="s2">to a game the goal of which is to keep</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.019" end="00:21:08.490" style="s2">the game going for as long as possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.639" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">and add to continuously better the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.490" end="00:21:14.610" style="s2">quality of the game yes and so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.240" end="00:21:16.889" style="s2">rewards all participants and so that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.610" end="00:21:21.149" style="s2">guess the you know the the question then</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.889" end="00:21:24.029" style="s2">is at its base an economic question</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.149" end="00:21:25.710" style="s2">isn&#39;t it and so I think this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.029" end="00:21:29.159" style="s2">fun topic like I can tell that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.710" end="00:21:34.049" style="s2">become a boring grown-up because I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.159" end="00:21:36.630" style="s2">like fascinated by economics and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.049" end="00:21:38.580" style="s2">big part of it is watching the</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.769" end="00:21:57.809" style="s2">always stuck with me is something that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.409" end="00:22:00.419" style="s2">Doug rushkoff brought up in in present</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.809" end="00:22:02.460" style="s2">shock in terms of which you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.419" end="00:22:06.269" style="s2">the one that introduced me to finite and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.460" end="00:22:08.549" style="s2">infinite games he said that you look at</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.340" end="00:22:34.220" style="s2">negative interest could be applied to</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.720" end="00:23:00.500" style="s2">that you&#39;re boring and dull because</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.620" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">you&#39;re getting interested in economics</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.500" end="00:23:04.590" style="s2">if you&#39;re getting interested in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:05.880" style="s2">economics as a philosopher it actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.590" end="00:23:09.150" style="s2">means that you&#39;re just gaining deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.880" end="00:23:11.309" style="s2">insight into how structural incentive</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.150" end="00:23:14.070" style="s2">and structural value systems and</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.780" end="00:23:23.550" style="s2">thinking about those things and so if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.910" end="00:23:25.650" style="s2">say all right how much is air worth</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.550" end="00:23:28.770" style="s2">economically right now it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.650" end="00:23:30.540" style="s2">nothing at all and because it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.770" end="00:23:35.580" style="s2">nothing at all we make decisions based</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.540" end="00:23:37.860" style="s2">on financial statements right then we</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.580" end="00:23:42.120" style="s2">will pollute the air and burn it up now</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.860" end="00:23:44.760" style="s2">how much is gold worth it&#39;s worth a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.120" end="00:23:46.740" style="s2">of certain amount per ounce so we will</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.760" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">destroy an ecosystem if we need to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.740" end="00:23:52.530" style="s2">get the gold out from underneath it to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:53.910" style="s2">put it in bars and a safe that is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.530" end="00:23:57.090" style="s2">doing anything for anyone other than</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.910" end="00:24:01.830" style="s2">effecting a financial accounting sheet</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.090" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">and I want the gold because since we see</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.830" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">it as relatively scarce in a win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:09.030" style="s2">game structure if there are scarce</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:09.990" style="s2">things that with it not everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.030" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">have it abundantly</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.990" end="00:24:14.580" style="s2">then I get differential advantage by</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:16.110" style="s2">having it if something is abundant like</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.580" end="00:24:17.880" style="s2">air where everybody can have it then it</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.110" end="00:24:19.340" style="s2">gives me no competitive advantage over</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.880" end="00:24:22.050" style="s2">anyone else so it we don&#39;t value it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.340" end="00:24:24.210" style="s2">now if we were valuing what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.050" end="00:24:26.220" style="s2">relevant to life support or to quality</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.210" end="00:24:28.970" style="s2">of life or to systemic advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.220" end="00:24:31.740" style="s2">course that would be flipped but in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.970" end="00:24:34.700" style="s2">fundamentally win-lose game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.740" end="00:24:37.260" style="s2">structure we value things that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.700" end="00:24:38.420" style="s2">relative to our capacity to win at that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.260" end="00:24:40.840" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.420" end="00:24:43.880" style="s2">and that is pretty much exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.840" end="00:24:45.830" style="s2">pathological it doesn&#39;t mean that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.880" end="00:24:49.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t serve some relevant evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.830" end="00:24:55.070" style="s2">value but that value is at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.220" end="00:24:57.320" style="s2">its lifecycle and so so let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.070" end="00:24:59.240" style="s2">what the future of macroeconomics has to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.320" end="00:25:02.570" style="s2">be and then so the the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.240" end="00:25:05.210" style="s2">Demerara negative interest obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.570" end="00:25:08.810" style="s2">when we have interest we have an</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.210" end="00:25:10.280" style="s2">incentive to keep money out of supply</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.810" end="00:25:11.930" style="s2">and keep resources out of supply which</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.280" end="00:25:14.780" style="s2">means that it&#39;s gonna maximize</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.930" end="00:25:16.610" style="s2">extraction and have an maximized</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.780" end="00:25:19.040" style="s2">hoarding right</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.610" end="00:25:21.290" style="s2">and you&#39;re also gonna get increasing</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.040" end="00:25:22.970" style="s2">wealth inequality because those who have</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.290" end="00:25:28.160" style="s2">more will get more compounding interest</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.970" end="00:25:30.770" style="s2">on that and etc so there dem raj is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.160" end="00:25:31.100" style="s2">interesting thing to address some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.770" end="00:25:33.410" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.100" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">nowhere near adequate and it creates</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.410" end="00:25:36.800" style="s2">some of its own problems which is now</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:39.530" style="s2">you have an artificial incentive to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.800" end="00:25:40.730" style="s2">transactions occur and transactions</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.530" end="00:25:44.090" style="s2">movement and the system actually is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.730" end="00:25:48.550" style="s2">entropy if the action is not actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.090" end="00:25:51.680" style="s2">relevant right so system-wide incentives</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.550" end="00:25:53.570" style="s2">of almost any kind are usually</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.680" end="00:25:55.970" style="s2">problematic right so we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.570" end="00:25:58.490" style="s2">go to a much deeper level of insight</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.970" end="00:25:59.960" style="s2">here so we say what what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.490" end="00:26:01.630" style="s2">we&#39;re really trying to do one way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.960" end="00:26:07.130" style="s2">defining it in terms of macro economy</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.630" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">would be we need to rigorously align the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.130" end="00:26:11.270" style="s2">incentive of every agent and whether the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:12.980" style="s2">agents an individual or a group of</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.680" end="00:26:27.500" style="s2">degree that there is gap meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.410" end="00:26:28.670" style="s2">two agents have misaligned interest and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.500" end="00:26:30.500" style="s2">you have direct arm right direct</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.670" end="00:26:33.080" style="s2">competition which can express itself</p>

<p begin="00:28:26.009" end="00:28:29.970" style="s2">actually is the precedent of universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:32.580" style="s2">when you take a very long view which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.970" end="00:28:34.860" style="s2">you know let&#39;s say that life originated</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.580" end="00:28:37.080" style="s2">on this earth and the model of cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.860" end="00:28:38.759" style="s2">Genesis that we use commonly is true</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.759" end="00:28:43.590" style="s2">take them as true for a minute as</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.990" end="00:28:45.539" style="s2">because it&#39;s a good analogy then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.590" end="00:28:47.399" style="s2">got 12 billion years of universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.539" end="00:28:49.379" style="s2">existing and doing all kinds of and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.399" end="00:28:50.909" style="s2">making galaxies and stars and supernovas</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.909" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">and you would think if after 12 billion</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.250" end="00:28:57.720" style="s2">years of interactions it would have kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:58.860" style="s2">of exhausted its search space so life is</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.720" end="00:29:00.210" style="s2">not possible and then life</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.860" end="00:29:02.580" style="s2">happens and it&#39;s totally unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.210" end="00:29:04.649" style="s2">based on the things previous right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.580" end="00:29:06.269" style="s2">then you go on and on all of human</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.649" end="00:29:08.669" style="s2">history to earn 50,000 years right</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.269" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">before the plow and there&#39;s we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.669" end="00:29:12.269" style="s2">actually have a economics we only had a</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.269" end="00:29:16.620" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have surplus and without sir</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.620" end="00:29:20.340" style="s2">you don&#39;t have economics right so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.149" end="00:29:22.769" style="s2">economics emerged unprecedented and on</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.340" end="00:29:24.630" style="s2">and on right so it is actually the</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.630" end="00:29:32.220" style="s2">to do unprecedented and so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.789" end="00:29:33.960" style="s2">shift for us right now is if we look at</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.630" end="00:29:46.380" style="s2">it&#39;s true all of us drew all those</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.429" end="00:29:47.850" style="s2">exponential puzzle curves are true if</p>

<p begin="00:30:09.210" end="00:30:13.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just that the phase is</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.370" end="00:33:35.510" style="s2">your head about the the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.230" end="00:33:37.090" style="s2">services too so I&#39;d love to break off</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.090" end="00:33:44.660" style="s2">ecosystem services sounds like a nice</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.980" end="00:33:46.130" style="s2">idea like lots of kind of New Economics</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.660" end="00:33:47.480" style="s2">ideas sounds like a nice idea and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.740" end="00:34:02.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work at all and so you know we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.020" end="00:34:07.370" style="s2">can just think about that as a defining</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.780" end="00:34:10.190" style="s2">criteria for a moment and say okay with</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.370" end="00:34:11.840" style="s2">the distribution of tech right and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.190" end="00:34:13.460" style="s2">first existential tech the world had was</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.840" end="00:34:15.380" style="s2">nuclear bomb we had two superpowers that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.460" end="00:34:17.330" style="s2">had it because it was super hard to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.380" end="00:34:18.950" style="s2">super expensive and so you could have</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.330" end="00:34:20.630" style="s2">those to spy on each other and have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.950" end="00:34:22.280" style="s2">mutually assured destruction system so</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.630" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">nobody could use it and we could live in</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.280" end="00:34:27.320" style="s2">the relatively dreadful peace of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:28.550" style="s2">Cold War right now of course we have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.320" end="00:34:30.140" style="s2">lot more than two countries that have</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.550" end="00:34:31.820" style="s2">nuclear weapons and we have nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.140" end="00:34:36.169" style="s2">weapons and places that we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.820" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">know but with exponential biotech and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.169" end="00:34:41.690" style="s2">nanotech and AI Tekkit cetera you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:45.669" style="s2">stronger than nuclear level capacity by</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.690" end="00:34:48.830" style="s2">non-state actors radically distributed</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.669" end="00:34:51.020" style="s2">how do we make it through that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.830" end="00:34:52.520" style="s2">deep question right and it really is if</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.020" end="00:34:54.169" style="s2">you want to think of it in a mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.520" end="00:34:58.580" style="s2">sense which I think you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.169" end="00:35:00.410" style="s2">if we are gaining the power of gods then</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.580" end="00:35:03.380" style="s2">without the love and wisdom of gods we</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.410" end="00:35:06.440" style="s2">self-destruct and that we are gaining</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.380" end="00:35:09.710" style="s2">the power of gods is now both a given</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:11.540" style="s2">and unavoidable so what is the gain the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.710" end="00:35:14.540" style="s2">love and wisdom of gods curve that gets</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.540" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">there in time and so that that power is</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.540" end="00:35:18.290" style="s2">actually used for the good of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:20.540" style="s2">because if it&#39;s used against which</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.290" end="00:35:22.040" style="s2">elicits counter against switch have that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.540" end="00:35:27.410" style="s2">much power everywhere then you get self</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.040" end="00:35:30.190" style="s2">destruct and so it&#39;s important to really</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.410" end="00:35:32.930" style="s2">get that as a framing so we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.190" end="00:35:35.030" style="s2">that the things that have worked before</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.930" end="00:35:36.170" style="s2">some modified version of them will work</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.030" end="00:35:40.230" style="s2">now because it&#39;s a radically different</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.170" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">context okay so environmental services</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.230" end="00:35:47.050" style="s2">so if I have a rain forest or a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:49.569" style="s2">marshland or whatever it&#39;s not worth</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.050" end="00:35:51.099" style="s2">anything right now so if it gets cut</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.569" end="00:35:52.390" style="s2">down and turned into grazing land for</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.099" end="00:35:54.430" style="s2">cattle or whatever it&#39;s worth something</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.390" end="00:35:55.930" style="s2">so how do i how do I keep it from</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.430" end="00:35:57.339" style="s2">getting cut down low can I make it worth</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.930" end="00:35:59.829" style="s2">more alive well I can say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.339" end="00:36:02.920" style="s2">sequestering so much co2 and stabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.829" end="00:36:05.740" style="s2">so much you know soil runoff when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.920" end="00:36:07.809" style="s2">rains come and then if I can get a value</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.740" end="00:36:09.790" style="s2">on that at the co2 can be in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.809" end="00:36:14.200" style="s2">carbon credits and you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.790" end="00:36:15.609" style="s2">rain then maybe we can keep it alive to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.200" end="00:36:18.010" style="s2">the degree that that helps any ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.609" end="00:36:22.630" style="s2">right now I&#39;m delighted as a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.010" end="00:36:25.450" style="s2">strategy if what I&#39;m in several things</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.630" end="00:36:26.589" style="s2">wrong with it if I&#39;m incenting if the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.450" end="00:36:29.380" style="s2">way that it&#39;s making money is</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.589" end="00:36:31.960" style="s2">sequestering co2 then I want to start</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.380" end="00:36:34.329" style="s2">optimizing it for heavy sequestering co2</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.960" end="00:36:37.950" style="s2">plants right well then it makes more</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.329" end="00:36:41.109" style="s2">money as opposed to the whole rich</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.950" end="00:36:43.630" style="s2">biodiversity that makes a healthy forest</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.109" end="00:36:46.799" style="s2">or ecosystem many of which are going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.630" end="00:36:49.510" style="s2">be less optimized for co2 sequestration</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.799" end="00:36:51.880" style="s2">then you know another way of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.510" end="00:36:53.170" style="s2">right and so but then I say well what</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.880" end="00:36:54.750" style="s2">are the other things that it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.170" end="00:36:56.920" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know how to monetize yet</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.750" end="00:36:58.930" style="s2">there are other plants that are pulling</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.920" end="00:37:01.329" style="s2">out different kinds of particulate</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.930" end="00:37:03.490" style="s2">pollution and also what is the effect to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.329" end="00:37:05.380" style="s2">the pollinators and to the birds and do</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.490" end="00:37:07.930" style="s2">that right and when I really understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.380" end="00:37:10.780" style="s2">what a tree is doing it&#39;s doing an</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.930" end="00:37:12.910" style="s2">indefinite like an undefinable number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.780" end="00:37:15.970" style="s2">positive things to an undefinable number</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.910" end="00:37:18.130" style="s2">of beneficiaries and when I take some</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.970" end="00:37:19.839" style="s2">small metrics based subsets then I will</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.130" end="00:37:21.400" style="s2">start to optimize for that small metrics</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.839" end="00:37:22.750" style="s2">based subset which is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.400" end="00:37:24.940" style="s2"> wrong problem that we do</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.750" end="00:37:26.950" style="s2">everywhere which is we take a complex</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.940" end="00:37:28.780" style="s2">system reduce it to a complicated system</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.950" end="00:37:30.460" style="s2">optimized for the complicated system</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.780" end="00:37:36.849" style="s2">kill the complex system in the process</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.460" end="00:37:39.190" style="s2">and so if I take an n-dimensional set of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.849" end="00:37:41.980" style="s2">self-organizing complex metrics and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.190" end="00:37:43.720" style="s2">reduce them to 10 metrics and I run</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.980" end="00:37:45.430" style="s2">optimization functions across those</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.720" end="00:37:48.730" style="s2">it&#39;ll be the wrong thing every time</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.430" end="00:37:50.079" style="s2">so metrics based optimization right I</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.730" end="00:37:52.180" style="s2">can look at somebody&#39;s low-density</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.079" end="00:37:52.780" style="s2">lipoprotein give them a statin drug and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.180" end="00:37:54.310" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.780" end="00:37:57.940" style="s2">and their low-density lipoprotein comes</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.310" end="00:37:59.770" style="s2">down awesome except that the toxicity to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.940" end="00:38:01.870" style="s2">the liver in the toxicity to the brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.770" end="00:38:04.060" style="s2">that come with that statin and etc and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.870" end="00:38:05.620" style="s2">even why the cholesterol was high that</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.060" end="00:38:07.330" style="s2">might have been the body&#39;s protecting</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.620" end="00:38:10.630" style="s2">its vascular system from certain kinds</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.330" end="00:38:13.270" style="s2">of damage I&#39;m not measuring those things</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.630" end="00:38:15.970" style="s2">right and when if I try to measure all</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.270" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">of them now I get so many metrics and</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.970" end="00:38:18.700" style="s2">try and do optimization across them</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:20.440" style="s2">that&#39;s actually uncomputable it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.700" end="00:38:22.500" style="s2">an np-complete issue and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.440" end="00:38:25.090" style="s2">actually find optimization points and</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.500" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">metrics based optimization has to us</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.090" end="00:38:31.270" style="s2">always think in terms of theory of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:33.370" style="s2">trade-offs so okay how much liver damage</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.270" end="00:38:36.220" style="s2">is worth how much brain damage is worth</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.370" end="00:38:38.530" style="s2">how much risk of heart disease so that i</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.220" end="00:38:40.480" style="s2">optimize between those but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.530" end="00:38:42.280" style="s2">uncommon tradable right how many dead</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.480" end="00:38:43.780" style="s2">rhinos is worth how many parts per</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.280" end="00:38:45.400" style="s2">million of mercury in the water is worth</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.780" end="00:38:47.290" style="s2">how many tons of co2 to know how to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.400" end="00:38:51.820" style="s2">allocate my resources no but I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.290" end="00:38:54.070" style="s2">find out because I&#39;m you know but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.820" end="00:38:55.870" style="s2">right though it&#39;s like they have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.070" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">actually start that for uplift connect</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.870" end="00:38:58.990" style="s2">there is like you you know this the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">whole there&#39;s like there&#39;s actually like</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.990" end="00:39:05.350" style="s2">a a socially toxic dimension to life</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">optimization for this very reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.350" end="00:39:11.650" style="s2">like the sinister side of this trend to</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.650" end="00:39:16.870" style="s2">there is part of that that you say oh</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.870" end="00:39:23.320" style="s2">post industrial work existence yeah then</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.320" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">can get as close as possible to an</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.900" end="00:39:29.710" style="s2">imaginary Paleolithic human being or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.380" style="s2">whatever it is you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.710" end="00:39:34.870" style="s2">it&#39;s bonkers so anyway so go on there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.380" end="00:39:36.790" style="s2">a couple different issues there one is</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.870" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">are the things that we think we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.790" end="00:39:42.850" style="s2">optimizing for the right things at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:44.500" style="s2">right if we have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.850" end="00:39:46.930" style="s2">genetically engineer the human is our</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.500" end="00:39:49.810" style="s2">goal to make us all the best hyper</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.930" end="00:39:51.070" style="s2">computers possible right like as we get</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.810" end="00:39:52.360" style="s2">exponential technically can actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.070" end="00:39:54.040" style="s2">change what we&#39;ve thought of as nature</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.360" end="00:39:55.660" style="s2">itself we get very deep ethical and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.040" end="00:39:58.060" style="s2">existential questions at the core of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.660" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">but what I&#39;m actually bringing up here</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.060" end="00:40:01.060" style="s2">is a that&#39;s a core issue but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:02.470" style="s2">bringing up a separate issue which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.060" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">actually was just just a result of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.470" end="00:40:06.060" style="s2">metrics and there is actually around it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:11.530" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.060" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">eat from a information theory point of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.530" end="00:40:16.810" style="s2">view I want to know what is everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:20.020" style="s2">that matters in a particular situation</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.810" end="00:40:22.450" style="s2">where we&#39;re going to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.020" end="00:40:24.280" style="s2">development or you know in enhance</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.450" end="00:40:26.050" style="s2">something but I want to know what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.280" end="00:40:27.100" style="s2">everything that matters what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.050" end="00:40:30.940" style="s2">matters about it how is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.100" end="00:40:33.310" style="s2">interconnected now if I use metrics and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.940" end="00:40:35.170" style="s2">I&#39;ve got this thing is on a one to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.310" end="00:40:36.970" style="s2">thousand scale and this is on a negative</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.170" end="00:40:38.290" style="s2">a thousand to a thousand scale and this</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.970" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">is this kind of unit in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.290" end="00:40:41.859" style="s2">unit how do i commensurate them when</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:44.950" style="s2">they&#39;re actually non fungible types of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.859" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">value right this species goes extinct</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.950" end="00:40:49.840" style="s2">but this other one like it gets a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:51.369" style="s2">bit better there well did they have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.840" end="00:40:55.119" style="s2">say in it are they considered</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.369" end="00:40:57.730" style="s2">beneficiaries of the system and so if</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:41:01.330" style="s2">instead if I use a if I use a boolean</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.730" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">system where it is a zero on one based</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.330" end="00:41:06.820" style="s2">system and really what I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:10.270" style="s2">is does this thing matter does this</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.820" end="00:41:12.580" style="s2">particular value creature process matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.270" end="00:41:14.560" style="s2">and if so then we have to create a</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.580" end="00:41:17.170" style="s2">design that tends to it and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.560" end="00:41:19.480" style="s2">have a boolean tree underneath it that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.170" end="00:41:21.940" style="s2">says what matters about it but when I</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.480" end="00:41:23.440" style="s2">have them in 0 and 1 I don&#39;t look at how</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.940" end="00:41:25.150" style="s2">much do i damage it or how much do I</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.440" end="00:41:27.430" style="s2">take care of it i define thresholds of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.150" end="00:41:30.070" style="s2">what takecare means it creates two zero</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.430" end="00:41:31.990" style="s2">one but then everything that matters</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.070" end="00:41:34.450" style="s2">becomes a design constraint to an</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.990" end="00:41:37.480" style="s2">integrated complex system design process</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.450" end="00:41:38.770" style="s2">and now I&#39;m not looking at these each of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.480" end="00:41:40.450" style="s2">the issues separately and saying how</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.770" end="00:41:41.530" style="s2">much resource do I put into this one and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.450" end="00:41:43.570" style="s2">put into this one what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.530" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">optimization point I&#39;m saying how do I</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.570" end="00:41:46.990" style="s2">create an integrated system design that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:50.619" style="s2">tends to everything that matters here</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.990" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">and so this is a different information</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.619" end="00:41:55.210" style="s2">theoretic way of approaching complex</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:58.990" style="s2">systems it is actually relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.210" end="00:42:01.840" style="s2">complexity so it seemed for a while</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.990" end="00:42:05.560" style="s2">there that you are getting into this</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.840" end="00:42:07.690" style="s2">whole stream conversationally drifts</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.560" end="00:42:11.720" style="s2">into the area of</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.690" end="00:42:15.530" style="s2">where this change is gonna come from and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.720" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">clearly because it is a planet-wide</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.530" end="00:42:18.109" style="s2">phenomenon it&#39;s gonna come from</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:20.690" style="s2">everywhere at once</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.109" end="00:42:23.720" style="s2">in some sense but then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.690" end="00:42:27.109" style="s2">William Gibson future arrives and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.720" end="00:42:31.099" style="s2">unevenly distributed right so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.109" end="00:42:33.500" style="s2">see this well it&#39;s it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.099" end="00:42:36.829" style="s2">holistic right because holistic tends to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.500" end="00:42:39.319" style="s2">reduce things to systems and I know from</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.829" end="00:42:42.109" style="s2">you know your acquaintance with Ken</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.319" end="00:42:44.119" style="s2">Wilber that you know you don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.109" end="00:42:47.930" style="s2">individual or the system or the culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.119" end="00:42:50.809" style="s2">or the the inner life world the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.930" end="00:42:54.440" style="s2">experience as like reducible to one</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.809" end="00:42:58.190" style="s2">another you know so how do how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.440" end="00:43:00.440" style="s2">understand this like every like all</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.190" end="00:43:04.670" style="s2">scales of organization all levels of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.440" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">complexity just go a current shift in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.670" end="00:43:11.329" style="s2">the order like in what way do you expect</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:14.420" style="s2">to see it taking shape you know how are</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.329" end="00:43:16.910" style="s2">you consciously participating in its</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.420" end="00:43:18.710" style="s2">emergence yeah so there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.910" end="00:43:22.220" style="s2">projects that we&#39;re working on related</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.710" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">to these things but I&#39;ll just go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.220" end="00:43:31.099" style="s2">and talk about how do we see this shift</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:34.430" style="s2">occurring kind of macro so just to use a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.099" end="00:43:36.650" style="s2">very classic analogy when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.430" end="00:43:38.750" style="s2">the transition the discrete nonlinear</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.650" end="00:43:40.760" style="s2">phase shift transition from caterpillar</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.750" end="00:43:42.940" style="s2">to butterfly it goes through a liminal</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.760" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">phase right which is the chrysalis and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.940" end="00:43:47.420" style="s2">the caterpillar doesn&#39;t just like lose</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:49.970" style="s2">weight and grow wings the caterpillar</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.420" end="00:43:52.369" style="s2">actually goes through a very complete</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.970" end="00:43:54.829" style="s2">dissolution process and then the amino</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.369" end="00:43:57.470" style="s2">acids are resequenced by a second set of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.829" end="00:44:02.510" style="s2">DNA butterfly DNA caterpillar DNA two</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.470" end="00:44:04.970" style="s2">different code bases and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.510" end="00:44:07.339" style="s2">really see that the caterpillars job was</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.970" end="00:44:10.520" style="s2">it had a developmental phase where it</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.339" end="00:44:12.589" style="s2">was basically defined by net growth and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.520" end="00:44:14.530" style="s2">consumption on renewably gathering the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.589" end="00:44:16.369" style="s2">parts necessary to then be reassembled</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.530" end="00:44:17.720" style="s2">foundationally into a different code</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.369" end="00:44:20.270" style="s2">that was not about net growth and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.720" end="00:44:21.290" style="s2">consumption in the same way if the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.270" end="00:44:23.090" style="s2">caterpillar didn&#39;t go through</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.290" end="00:44:24.590" style="s2">phase-shifted eat itself into extinction</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.090" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">so if you plotted those curves you would</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.590" end="00:44:28.490" style="s2">say it eats itself into extinction but</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:30.950" style="s2">of course as the blood starts getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.490" end="00:44:32.540" style="s2">rich enough to be able to you know go</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.950" end="00:44:34.970" style="s2">into the chrysalis you start getting the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.540" end="00:44:37.100" style="s2">first imaginal cells kicking in which of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.970" end="00:44:39.200" style="s2">course the caterpillar body attacks as</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.100" end="00:44:40.790" style="s2">foreign invaders but then they start to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:42.470" style="s2">proliferate more triggers to movement</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.790" end="00:44:45.980" style="s2">into the chrysalis dissolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.470" end="00:44:47.930" style="s2">caterpillar recoding so this and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.980" end="00:44:50.600" style="s2">just to complete that story the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.930" end="00:44:53.060" style="s2">butterfly is actually pollinating the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.600" end="00:44:55.190" style="s2">plants that the caterpillar decimated</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.060" end="00:44:56.330" style="s2">but across these vast ecosystem spaces</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.190" end="00:44:58.970" style="s2">that helps the evolution of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.330" end="00:45:02.690" style="s2">thing right so you get what was that an</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.970" end="00:45:05.540" style="s2">unsustainable devastating based on</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.690" end="00:45:07.340" style="s2">growth and consumption was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.540" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">developmental phase of something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.340" end="00:45:10.910" style="s2">helping the evolution of all those</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:14.690" style="s2">systems so if we think about</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.910" end="00:45:16.790" style="s2">developmental phases the forty weeks of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.690" end="00:45:19.510" style="s2">a baby in utero if it continued would</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.790" end="00:45:23.060" style="s2">kill itself in the mall and the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.510" end="00:45:26.300" style="s2">phase shift of leave the birth canal</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.060" end="00:45:27.620" style="s2">umbilical cord cut is not predicted by</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.300" end="00:45:28.490" style="s2">the forty weeks before if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.620" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">know that thing was going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.490" end="00:45:33.830" style="s2">right the the same is true of a chicken</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.450" style="s2">inside of an egg shell so you have all</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.830" end="00:45:37.370" style="s2">of these discrete phase shifts</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.450" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">associated with developmental phases and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.370" end="00:45:41.480" style="s2">I think it&#39;s fair to look at humanity as</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:43.430" style="s2">being in a developmental phase defined</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.480" end="00:45:45.410" style="s2">by net growth and consumption of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.430" end="00:45:47.930" style="s2">technological and scientific and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.410" end="00:45:50.360" style="s2">know etc capacities that are necessary</p>

<p begin="00:46:17.630" end="00:46:24.080" style="s2">by that so the kind of economics that is</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.630" end="00:46:41.930" style="s2">that nobody really wants to spend their</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:43.430" style="s2">life doing that civilization needs you</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.690" end="00:46:48.740" style="s2">doing the shitty job so you either give</p>

<p begin="00:46:48.740" end="00:46:52.519" style="s2">as a state and communist way and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.260" end="00:46:54.230" style="s2">the state has to force people to do the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.519" end="00:46:56.210" style="s2">shady job so it&#39;s Imperial we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.230" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2">it or you let the free market force them</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.210" end="00:47:01.069" style="s2">which is if they don&#39;t do the jobs they</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:47:02.630" style="s2">starve but as soon as technological</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.069" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">automation starts replacing the shitty</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.630" end="00:47:08.269" style="s2">jobs and it&#39;s non-sentient doers of</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.079" end="00:47:22.039" style="s2">you think we&#39;re gonna go is all shitty</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:23.869" style="s2">jobs progressively yeah and but</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.039" end="00:47:25.430" style="s2">basically it goes like this if you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.869" end="00:47:25.910" style="s2">write a process for it you can automate</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.430" end="00:47:27.710" style="s2">a bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.910" end="00:47:29.750" style="s2">it requires the technology to advance</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.710" end="00:47:32.779" style="s2">but anything you can write a process for</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.750" end="00:47:35.059" style="s2">you can automate and without a GI right</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.779" end="00:47:37.039" style="s2">with just automation and anything you</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.059" end="00:47:38.900" style="s2">can write a process for no human wants</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.900" end="00:47:41.750" style="s2">for a little while you might get kind of</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.750" end="00:47:48.380" style="s2">but ultimately doing things that are</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.380" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">based is where our intrinsic incentive</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.359" end="00:47:54.349" style="s2">is gonna come and so there happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:57.740" style="s2">a very nice match here right between</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.349" end="00:47:59.930" style="s2">what our generalist capacity that can</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:20.450" style="s2">there will be initial prototypes that</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.500" end="00:48:21.650" style="s2">now you know we have plenty of eco</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.450" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">villages that are prototyping some</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.650" end="00:48:24.680" style="s2">things and it&#39;s a part of the curve</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:28.250" style="s2">right and it&#39;s nice but they actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.680" end="00:48:29.750" style="s2">don&#39;t offer a model for how civilization</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.250" end="00:48:31.940" style="s2">could change comprehensively they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.750" end="00:48:35.059" style="s2">have the ability yet technologically to</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.700" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">funny irony is that the Omni win/win</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.790" end="00:49:41.069" style="s2">system actually outcompetes the win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:43.890" style="s2">system well obsoleting win-lose dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.069" end="00:49:46.170" style="s2">itself and that is the transcendence of</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.170" end="00:49:50.760" style="s2">phase because in the win-lose phase you</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.720" end="00:52:22.520" style="s2">bonus I have to think about but it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.700" end="00:52:24.020" style="s2">not a hierarchy that has any of what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.520" end="00:52:26.840" style="s2">have thought of as power structures</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.020" end="00:52:28.130" style="s2">involved open source as we understand it</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.840" end="00:52:32.690" style="s2">right now as necessary but not</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.130" end="00:52:34.610" style="s2">sufficient and if you were to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.690" end="00:52:37.850" style="s2">reduce it to a couple words you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.610" end="00:52:40.280" style="s2">reduce it to a word which would be Omni</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.850" end="00:52:42.040" style="s2">considerate more than the applied side</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.280" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">of that which would be Omni win-win</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.040" end="00:52:48.710" style="s2">which means that any act of agency</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:52.970" style="s2">positively effects everything that it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.710" end="00:52:54.770" style="s2">effects and what is the only considerate</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.970" end="00:52:57.740" style="s2">is the consideration of how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.770" end="00:53:00.050" style="s2">right but that can&#39;t just be an idea it</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.740" end="00:53:02.210" style="s2">actually has to be the economic system</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.050" end="00:53:05.600" style="s2">itself in the governance system as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.210" end="00:53:06.809" style="s2">as culture and the tools that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.600" end="00:53:08.459" style="s2">necessary to do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.809" end="00:53:13.799" style="s2">so I know that we&#39;re running out of time</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.459" end="00:53:15.719" style="s2">here with you and this is this just</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.799" end="00:53:17.269" style="s2">points us to what could end up</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.719" end="00:53:19.380" style="s2">ultimately being kind of a cliffhanger</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.269" end="00:53:21.179" style="s2">question because I feel like we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.380" end="00:53:24.679" style="s2">created up you know the map of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.179" end="00:53:27.809" style="s2">problema TKE here and we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.679" end="00:53:30.839" style="s2">glance at at least the the contours of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.809" end="00:53:36.059" style="s2">or textures of this the flavor of some</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.839" end="00:53:40.140" style="s2">solutions but I guess you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.059" end="00:53:41.699" style="s2">have insight or suggestion into this</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.140" end="00:53:45.089" style="s2">particular area maybe this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.699" end="00:53:47.130" style="s2">good way to end it which is because</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.089" end="00:53:49.859" style="s2">we&#39;re all at different points along a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.130" end="00:53:52.439" style="s2">like a developmental sequence you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.859" end="00:53:55.709" style="s2">like what we&#39;re able to consider what</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.439" end="00:53:57.569" style="s2">we&#39;re able to attend to who were able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.709" end="00:54:01.559" style="s2">take into consideration as an audience</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.569" end="00:54:04.380" style="s2">or as the affected by our actions is you</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.559" end="00:54:08.009" style="s2">know limited by our ability to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.380" end="00:54:11.819" style="s2">and to cognize by by that like by how</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.009" end="00:54:14.729" style="s2">much we are able to experience and thus</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.819" end="00:54:17.130" style="s2">I have the potential to identify with in</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.729" end="00:54:20.309" style="s2">our in our world you know like how much</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.130" end="00:54:23.279" style="s2">how big is the planet of our experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.309" end="00:54:26.039" style="s2">how far is that horizon and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.279" end="00:54:31.169" style="s2">when we talk about the the way that this</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.039" end="00:54:34.829" style="s2">is gonna work is by organizing things so</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.169" end="00:54:36.119" style="s2">that everyone&#39;s incentivized to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.829" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">participate in a way that benefits</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.119" end="00:54:41.789" style="s2">everyone is it even possible to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:44.819" style="s2">that kind of does not Omni consideration</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.789" end="00:54:47.969" style="s2">require omnipresence like a total</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.819" end="00:54:50.369" style="s2">surveillance or like perhaps like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.969" end="00:54:54.900" style="s2">shift in our consciousness as</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.369" end="00:54:57.319" style="s2">individuals that would be perhaps like</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.900" end="00:54:59.099" style="s2">difficult for us to contain</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.319" end="00:55:01.609" style="s2">psychologically I mean how does this</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.099" end="00:55:05.519" style="s2">even how do you see this being deployed</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.609" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">implemented sure so it&#39;s pretty hard for</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.519" end="00:55:10.559" style="s2">me to consider how to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:13.469" style="s2">quality of life of the creatures in</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.559" end="00:55:17.099" style="s2">another galaxy because I don&#39;t have very</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.469" end="00:55:19.380" style="s2">much since data about them to know how</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.099" end="00:55:19.869" style="s2">to do that fortunately I also don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.380" end="00:55:21.130" style="s2">the ability</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.869" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">affect them very much so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.130" end="00:55:25.059" style="s2">really matter right now as soon as I</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:27.430" style="s2">start getting the ability to affect them</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.059" end="00:55:31.480" style="s2">then understanding that matters so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.430" end="00:55:33.339" style="s2">need my sense systems and my information</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.480" end="00:55:36.549" style="s2">processing systems and my actuator</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.339" end="00:55:40.859" style="s2">systems connected if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.549" end="00:55:40.859" style="s2">from an evolutionary bio point of view</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.009" end="00:55:47.890" style="s2">it&#39;s never advantageous to select for</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.829" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">sensory systems alone it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.890" end="00:55:51.400" style="s2">sensory systems that then can integrate</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:54.059" style="s2">that sense input with the other senses</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.400" end="00:55:56.499" style="s2">and then be able to have information</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.059" end="00:55:58.359" style="s2">processing to inform choice and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.499" end="00:56:00.970" style="s2">have the actuator capacity to act on</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.359" end="00:56:02.529" style="s2">that choice within a closed loop of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.970" end="00:56:05.049" style="s2">ability to sense the effects of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.529" end="00:56:08.140" style="s2">choice and learn right and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.049" end="00:56:10.630" style="s2">information input information processing</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.140" end="00:56:12.369" style="s2">actuator output closed-loop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.630" end="00:56:14.470" style="s2">actually what gets selected for is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.369" end="00:56:15.880" style="s2">triplicate if you if I could send</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.470" end="00:56:17.920" style="s2">something that I couldn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.880" end="00:56:19.299" style="s2">of it would actually me up if I</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.920" end="00:56:21.359" style="s2">could send something that I couldn&#39;t act</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.299" end="00:56:24.279" style="s2">on it would mess things up right</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.359" end="00:56:26.769" style="s2">similarly if I could act on things where</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.279" end="00:56:28.450" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t sense the effect of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.769" end="00:56:29.980" style="s2">action and I wouldn&#39;t be able to learn</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.450" end="00:56:34.089" style="s2">if that was successful or not</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.980" end="00:56:36.730" style="s2">and so the triplicate of those is what</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.089" end="00:56:38.890" style="s2">defines the evolutionary adaptiveness of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.730" end="00:56:42.220" style="s2">a creature now what&#39;s happened for</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.890" end="00:56:44.470" style="s2">humans is that our ability to make tools</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.220" end="00:56:46.809" style="s2">which means our ability to identify some</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.470" end="00:56:49.029" style="s2">of our capacities our corporeal</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.809" end="00:56:51.519" style="s2">capacities and extend them in tools I</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.029" end="00:56:53.019" style="s2">can see the way that my fist can bang</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.519" end="00:56:54.999" style="s2">something I can make a hammer that can</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.019" end="00:56:56.529" style="s2">do it better it can make a wrench that</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.999" end="00:56:57.999" style="s2">can do what my grip can do better it can</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.529" end="00:57:00.579" style="s2">make a telescope that can extend my eye</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.999" end="00:57:02.890" style="s2">or a microscope I can make an industrial</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.579" end="00:57:06.430" style="s2">supply chain that can extend my entire</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.890" end="00:57:08.499" style="s2">production capacities right I can make</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.430" end="00:57:10.210" style="s2">computational systems or an abacus right</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.499" end="00:57:12.730" style="s2">that can extend my my processing</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.210" end="00:57:14.349" style="s2">capabilities but we can make these in</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.730" end="00:57:16.989" style="s2">isolation from each other so the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.349" end="00:57:19.150" style="s2">triplicate is not bound anymore so right</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.989" end="00:57:21.880" style="s2">now we have a world where we have an</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.150" end="00:57:23.559" style="s2">amazing amount of sensory input possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.880" end="00:57:24.759" style="s2">right we can see stuff from the Hubble</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.559" end="00:57:26.920" style="s2">we can see stuff from electron tunneling</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.759" end="00:57:29.130" style="s2">microscopes and then we can see input</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.920" end="00:57:31.749" style="s2">there on the world on the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.130" end="00:57:33.460" style="s2">but we that&#39;s decoupled from sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.749" end="00:57:34.839" style="s2">making so when I read stuff I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.460" end="00:57:36.040" style="s2">she tell if it&#39;s true or not I</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.839" end="00:57:38.740" style="s2">can&#39;t put it together with the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.040" end="00:57:40.630" style="s2">things that I know right and so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.740" end="00:57:43.000" style="s2">tremendous amount of sense input that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.630" end="00:57:44.740" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of then to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.000" end="00:57:47.980" style="s2">that makes sense of something like okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.740" end="00:57:49.390" style="s2">their co2 is actually a problem I have</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.980" end="00:57:51.820" style="s2">no idea how the to act on it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.390" end="00:57:53.740" style="s2">then to the degree that I act on things</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.820" end="00:57:55.390" style="s2">like I go by this laptop that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.740" end="00:57:57.099" style="s2">talking on that comes from industrial</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.390" end="00:57:58.990" style="s2">supply chain that affected life on six</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.099" end="00:58:00.790" style="s2">continents I actually have no sense</p>

<p begin="00:58:00.790" end="00:58:04.780" style="s2">affected and how it was affected to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.070" end="00:58:08.530" style="s2">inform if I want to make that choice or</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.780" end="00:58:10.900" style="s2">not so it&#39;s our information processing</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.530" end="00:58:13.210" style="s2">system is broken open which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.900" end="00:58:14.859" style="s2">fundamentally non adaptive and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.210" end="00:58:16.359" style="s2">running exponentially more energy</p>

<p begin="00:58:16.359" end="00:58:24.430" style="s2">ecology and so Omni consider it we</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.990" end="00:58:26.589" style="s2">basically when you said this require</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.430" end="00:58:28.180" style="s2">surveillance the sensory input and</p>

<p begin="00:58:29.770" end="00:58:33.430" style="s2">affecting I have to know that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.660" end="00:58:35.200" style="s2">affecting it and be able to factor it if</p>

<p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:40.030" style="s2">that much so to the degree that our</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.680" end="00:58:41.800" style="s2">actuator technologies are giving us the</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.240" end="00:58:52.450" style="s2">capacity and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so exciting</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.849" end="00:58:54.609" style="s2">to plant this recording in history that</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.450" end="00:58:56.589" style="s2">Facebook has told everyone this week</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.609" end="00:59:00.490" style="s2">they will be letting you know who paid</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.589" end="00:59:02.170" style="s2">for that ad so this has been super</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.490" end="00:59:03.940" style="s2">fascinating I know you&#39;ve got a hop to</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.170" end="00:59:07.869" style="s2">another meeting I feel like we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.940" end="00:59:09.670" style="s2">only started getting into the real meat</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.869" end="00:59:11.770" style="s2">of it and I would love to do this again</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.670" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">with you sometime yes I didn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.770" end="00:59:16.240" style="s2">answer your primary questions I want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:18.670" style="s2">say one thing to it the people who</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.240" end="00:59:22.510" style="s2">already have the capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.670" end="00:59:26.730" style="s2">disposition for Omni consideration will</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.510" end="00:59:29.140" style="s2">find each other and build systems that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.730" end="00:59:31.619" style="s2">increase that capacity and more people</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.140" end="00:59:34.690" style="s2">and that will be an auto poetic cycle I</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.619" end="00:59:38.050" style="s2">think I agree that really it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.690" end="00:59:42.099" style="s2">much about making this change occur as</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.050" end="00:59:44.710" style="s2">it is making it land as lightly as</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.099" end="00:59:45.960" style="s2">possible making sure as many people can</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.710" end="00:59:48.890" style="s2">get on that boat</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.960" end="00:59:52.020" style="s2">possible possibly widening the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.890" end="00:59:54.720" style="s2">definition of person here and where the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.020" end="00:59:59.490" style="s2">boat is actually a training ground for</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.720" end="01:00:02.580" style="s2">boat builders right and and captains and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.490" end="01:00:06.839" style="s2">this is the key thing is that those who</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.580" end="01:00:08.910" style="s2">are oriented to will build refugee</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.839" end="01:00:10.980" style="s2">solutions at scale for the massive</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.910" end="01:00:13.140" style="s2">upcoming human migration issues and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.980" end="01:00:15.060" style="s2">they&#39;ll say how do we build refugee</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.140" end="01:00:17.940" style="s2">solutions since the people won&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.060" end="01:00:21.300" style="s2">to integrate with current societies</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.940" end="01:00:22.500" style="s2">because nobody wants them and they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.300" end="01:00:24.869" style="s2">be able to go back to the places they</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.500" end="01:00:27.180" style="s2">came from for maybe forever so they have</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.869" end="01:00:29.040" style="s2">to be enduring which means that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.180" end="01:00:31.080" style="s2">subsidize them forever they have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.040" end="01:00:33.900" style="s2">actually be generative and since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.080" end="01:00:35.700" style="s2">basically building cities from scratch</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.900" end="01:00:37.230" style="s2">that have to be generative at scale for</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.700" end="01:00:39.240" style="s2">a long time this gives us the</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.230" end="01:00:41.400" style="s2">opportunity to take the fall out of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.240" end="01:00:41.790" style="s2">current failing system and build a new</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.400" end="01:00:43.830" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.790" end="01:00:45.750" style="s2">what should the education system there</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.830" end="01:00:47.280" style="s2">be what should the economic system be</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.750" end="01:00:48.869" style="s2">which is the governance system B what</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">should the media system be what should</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.869" end="01:00:52.920" style="s2">the you know all the Human Services be</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:55.200" style="s2">and how do we actually prototype that</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.920" end="01:00:57.210" style="s2">there will be people similarly thinking</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.200" end="01:00:59.880" style="s2">about how do we create macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.210" end="01:01:01.410" style="s2">systems that automatically are incenting</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.880" end="01:01:02.970" style="s2">when wind dynamics better so that</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.410" end="01:01:04.349" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s participating in those</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.970" end="01:01:06.119" style="s2">will be growing in their omni</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.349" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">consideration by the byproduct of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.119" end="01:01:12.480" style="s2">interfacing with the system educational</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:16.530" style="s2">systems etc so it is those at the front</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.480" end="01:01:17.970" style="s2">end of a omni consideration bell curve</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.530" end="01:01:20.130" style="s2">from the fortune of the life that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.970" end="01:01:23.099" style="s2">exposed them to those things have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.130" end="01:01:27.450" style="s2">self-organize and will self organize to</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.099" end="01:01:30.390" style="s2">create systems that then bring that kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.450" end="01:01:32.250" style="s2">of disposition to wider audiences which</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.390" end="01:01:35.580" style="s2">then continue to do the same thing and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.250" end="01:01:36.869" style="s2">then it scales absolutely yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.580" end="01:01:41.010" style="s2">one of the most interesting things about</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.869" end="01:01:44.540" style="s2">this is imagining how we can encourage</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.010" end="01:01:45.990" style="s2">people to play by new rules that benefit</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.540" end="01:01:50.670" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.990" end="01:01:54.119" style="s2">and with that how do people find you</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.670" end="01:01:57.270" style="s2">other than your totally pervasive</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.119" end="01:01:58.990" style="s2">Facebook ads for your amazing nootropic</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.270" end="01:02:01.060" style="s2">prod</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.990" end="01:02:03.030" style="s2">where do we send folks to follow up on</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.060" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">you and the way that you&#39;re helping out</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.030" end="01:02:08.320" style="s2">so the ads you&#39;re speaking about our</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:10.660" style="s2">company that we have called neural</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.320" end="01:02:12.640" style="s2">hacker collective neural hacker.com is</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.660" end="01:02:13.750" style="s2">the website and there&#39;s one product out</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.640" end="01:02:15.670" style="s2">right now which is in the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.750" end="01:02:18.520" style="s2">enhancement space but the the goal of</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.670" end="01:02:21.849" style="s2">that just to tie it together is working</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.520" end="01:02:23.680" style="s2">on complex systems medicine and complex</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.849" end="01:02:25.660" style="s2">systems psychopharmacology to actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.680" end="01:02:29.190" style="s2">do a better job of having human</p>
