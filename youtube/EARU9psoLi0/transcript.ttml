<p begin="00:00:04.529" end="00:00:10.280" style="s2">that&#39;s not what this videos about I came</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.250" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">across a YouTube channel few months ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.280" end="00:00:16.859" style="s2">called special books for special kids</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s amazing is a guy named Chris</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:22.560" style="s2">who interviews all of these amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:24.900" style="s2">humans not all kids and introduces you</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.560" end="00:00:26.730" style="s2">to the diversity of challenges on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.900" end="00:00:29.070" style="s2">planet and that we&#39;re all human and Rob</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.730" end="00:00:30.330" style="s2">lovable and we all have a voice and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.070" end="00:00:32.570" style="s2">is very much in alignment with my</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.330" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">mission and what I am currently doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.570" end="00:00:37.739" style="s2">and I just loved who I could sit there</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">for the day and fall in love with all of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.739" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">these human beings who I might never get</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">to meet real person and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">have passed and I got to introduce my</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">kid to them and even seeing her her good</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:53.840" style="s2">reactions and even her bad ones where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">can at least have that conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.840" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">front of like with me in my heart</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">instead of in front of someone I making</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">it hurt their feelings and like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">is deserving of love and connection and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">the fact that their comments have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:12.780" style="s2">disabled so that these kids cannot get</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2">that that community support that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:18.600" style="s2">were instilling and developing is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.920" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">ridiculous and I would really like it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.600" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">be reinstated and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">professional YouTube channel that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:26.340" style="s2">actually has millions of viewers also</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:30.470" style="s2">they do editing who do the thumbnail</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.340" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">thing which I clearly don&#39;t do but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.470" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">well I&#39;m gonna do a second one of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">because this is just does it work at my</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">internet connection no all right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:43.799" style="s2">know how that will look good thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:49.049" style="s2">people don&#39;t actually attend my YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.799" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">my live ones I don&#39;t have a platform of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.049" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">people they have a lot of people so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">can&#39;t offer that but what I can offer is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">my idea and which is not at all related</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">to this which is why we this this exact</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:09.090" style="s2">thing is why we need to be in control of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:12.209" style="s2">the media of the of the social media and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.090" end="00:02:12.700" style="s2">the technology that influences our daily</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.209" end="00:02:14.440" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.700" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">we need to own it so like this</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.440" end="00:02:19.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen where when even if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">blanket thing to keep people safe when</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.150" end="00:02:22.690" style="s2">you need to break the rules to make life</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:24.760" style="s2">better for people you break the rules</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.690" end="00:02:26.230" style="s2">and that is not done by a corporation</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.760" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not but I&#39;ve even done by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.230" end="00:02:29.319" style="s2">government because they need bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:32.650" style="s2">and all the way across the line if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.319" end="00:02:33.459" style="s2">owned YouTube we could vote on and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.650" end="00:02:34.930" style="s2">not saying we&#39;re not going to own</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.459" end="00:02:38.830" style="s2">YouTube YouTube&#39;s owned by corporations</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.930" end="00:02:41.110" style="s2">but we can create the technology that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.830" end="00:02:43.390" style="s2">own together and monetize it and invite</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.110" end="00:02:46.989" style="s2">people like chris over and invite so</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.390" end="00:02:49.600" style="s2">that if youtube itself existed in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.989" end="00:02:51.610" style="s2">different space where we collectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.600" end="00:02:53.980" style="s2">owned it and when that we don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.610" end="00:02:57.160" style="s2">decisions that hurt the entire all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.980" end="00:02:58.690" style="s2">the people who make the content the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.160" end="00:03:01.810" style="s2">content providers and we don&#39;t hurt the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.690" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">viewers we ask ok here that here are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.810" end="00:03:05.709" style="s2">things that are happening we need rules</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.380" style="s2">to support it so that kids aren&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.709" end="00:03:10.330" style="s2">hurt and then when those very rules are</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.380" end="00:03:12.549" style="s2">in fact hurting kids we need to fix</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.330" end="00:03:15.670" style="s2">those rules whether across the board or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.549" end="00:03:17.980" style="s2">in particular situations and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.670" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">even know you to reinstate their frickin</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.980" end="00:03:21.190" style="s2">comments because it is ablest and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:22.660" style="s2"> that they don&#39;t get their</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.190" end="00:03:24.609" style="s2">comments on there and those kids need</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.660" end="00:03:26.829" style="s2">community and we need to have those kids</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.609" end="00:03:28.690" style="s2">in our community and to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.829" end="00:03:30.070" style="s2">them and celebrate and the adults and be</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.690" end="00:03:31.359" style="s2">able to hear people&#39;s stories and hear</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.070" end="00:03:36.820" style="s2">their voices and chris is such a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.359" end="00:03:38.980" style="s2">beautiful person and i like he just has</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.820" end="00:03:41.260" style="s2">a heart and a genuine soul that like</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.980" end="00:03:42.670" style="s2">when you see the world through his eyes</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.260" end="00:03:45.220" style="s2">you fall in love with each of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.670" end="00:03:47.049" style="s2">people who clearly were always there and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.220" end="00:03:48.190" style="s2">they just didn&#39;t have a camera pointed</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.049" end="00:03:53.079" style="s2">at them and it didn&#39;t have their voices</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.190" end="00:03:56.170" style="s2">heard and he&#39;s doing it in a way that at</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.079" end="00:03:58.150" style="s2">least to me doesn&#39;t feel like the ablest</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.170" end="00:03:59.470" style="s2">propaganda that&#39;s often out there of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.150" end="00:04:00.700" style="s2">like this person was in a wheelchair and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.470" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">now they&#39;ve pushed through and they walk</p>
