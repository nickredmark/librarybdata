<p begin="00:01:10.140" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">underneath Sam you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">incredible intellect rather than arguing</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">with him about terms argue with him</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">about why it&#39;s important</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">end Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.600" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">backs out of his central conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:38.659" style="s2">because whenever he&#39;s really pressed one</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">says there&#39;s a game what is the game</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.659" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">science empirical data yeah he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">there is no secular morality there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">this thing called a P Aryan game like</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">what the pyridine game is secular</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:56.969" style="s2">morality that&#39;s what it is you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:59.250" style="s2">lose that argument and say that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.969" end="00:02:01.009" style="s2">can&#39;t have a secular morality right</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.250" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.009" end="00:02:07.350" style="s2">like now Sam Harris challenged him on</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">that ask him how a pata game is</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">different than a secular morality answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:14.519" style="s2">like ask</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:18.989" style="s2">him the questions to get Jordan to</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.500" end="00:05:12.830" style="s2">service of something in this context we</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.700" end="00:05:15.230" style="s2">call life and then what is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.830" end="00:05:18.620" style="s2">that we&#39;re calling life like this like</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.230" end="00:05:20.390" style="s2">that you know looking at it from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.620" end="00:05:23.900" style="s2">perspective of how do i articulate this</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.390" end="00:05:27.350" style="s2">how do I find a framework which is you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.900" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">know I seek lack of a better term a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.350" end="00:05:35.540" style="s2">rational definable generated in language</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:41.240" style="s2">but consciously articulated set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.540" end="00:05:43.130" style="s2">frames that you can use such that when</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.240" end="00:05:44.330" style="s2">you interpret the world your life you it</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.130" end="00:05:46.460" style="s2">causes you to make better and better</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.830" end="00:05:56.570" style="s2">now no no let&#39;s take this Union Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.560" end="00:05:58.669" style="s2">Campbell mythic story perspective let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.570" end="00:06:00.229" style="s2">take narrative and not in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.669" end="00:06:03.620" style="s2">narratives you create but the narratives</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.229" end="00:06:08.090" style="s2">you inherent yeah and the narratives</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.620" end="00:06:10.760" style="s2">that we as a culture have refined over</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.090" end="00:06:13.070" style="s2">the course of centuries or thousands</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.760" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">perhaps even tens or hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.070" end="00:06:19.160" style="s2">thousands of years yeah what what is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:22.280" style="s2">nature of those stories in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.160" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">archetypal piece not what do we create</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.280" end="00:06:29.020" style="s2">given that we inherit that yeah but what</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:33.729" style="s2">is the inheritance yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.020" end="00:06:36.410" style="s2">and it was just encountering that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.729" end="00:06:38.330" style="s2">integrating that but now he&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.410" end="00:06:41.390" style="s2">that and now there&#39;s all kinds of really</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.330" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">smart people who I enjoy and respect who</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.390" end="00:06:46.910" style="s2">are commenting on him yeah and I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:50.270" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you remember on my optimal</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.910" end="00:06:54.370" style="s2">human values site project I went through</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.270" end="00:06:57.560" style="s2">Sam Harris&#39;s the moral landscape yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.370" end="00:07:01.010" style="s2">right and used his fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.560" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">as a context in which to define a set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.010" end="00:07:06.440" style="s2">optimal human values yeah right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:09.320" style="s2">a rational like like let&#39;s look at this</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.440" end="00:07:11.870" style="s2">and abstract out from experience not</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.320" end="00:07:14.780" style="s2">let&#39;s take an archetype and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.870" end="00:07:18.889" style="s2">chaos and order and the dragon and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.780" end="00:07:22.490" style="s2">terror and tyranny and and the hero yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.889" end="00:07:28.130" style="s2">yeah and so like the play between Sam</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.490" end="00:07:30.440" style="s2">Harris in Jordan that fascinates me and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.130" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">just what how he shows up in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.440" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">and how the world is responding to him</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:36.260" style="s2">yep I thought it would be fun just to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:40.700" style="s2">find out where you&#39;re at in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.260" end="00:07:42.169" style="s2">conversation and just do our thing so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.700" end="00:07:45.229" style="s2">that&#39;s my intention for this</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.169" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">conversation yeah yeah and I bet I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.060" end="00:08:07.760" style="s2">criticism of him and stuff and like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:10.760" style="s2">lot of the responses right from people</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.760" end="00:08:14.390" style="s2">to what he&#39;s doing right both positive</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.760" end="00:08:16.370" style="s2">and and and negative and I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.390" end="00:08:21.080" style="s2">that like the one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.370" end="00:08:23.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve appreciated about him well first of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:25.490" style="s2">all I don&#39;t think he knows exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.060" end="00:08:28.880" style="s2">he&#39;s doing right like I don&#39;t know if he</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.490" end="00:08:31.970" style="s2">thinks he&#39;s doing something but I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.880" end="00:08:33.830" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of finding it out as he goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.970" end="00:08:35.780" style="s2">but the thing the thing I&#39;ve appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.830" end="00:08:37.520" style="s2">about him is and I&#39;m glad I have this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.780" end="00:08:40.580" style="s2">perspective from having watched him</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.520" end="00:08:42.740" style="s2">before all this when I go back and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.580" end="00:08:45.080" style="s2">watch an old interview of him or an old</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.740" end="00:08:49.100" style="s2">left him or something he&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.080" end="00:08:52.459" style="s2">same like he shows up and he&#39;s the in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.100" end="00:08:55.730" style="s2">experience he is he has the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.459" end="00:08:59.470" style="s2">emphasis he has the same thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.730" end="00:09:03.050" style="s2">something out but now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.470" end="00:09:05.450" style="s2">literally he&#39;s having a dialogue almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.050" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2">with the entire world and this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.450" end="00:09:10.100" style="s2">think it&#39;s really interesting to me is I</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:11.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s like it&#39;s highlighting the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.100" end="00:09:15.290" style="s2">possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.720" end="00:09:17.270" style="s2">of because I because a lot of this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.290" end="00:09:19.520" style="s2">happening over social media so happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.270" end="00:09:24.590" style="s2">over you look primarily YouTube right</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.520" end="00:09:26.870" style="s2">and podcasts but primarily to and I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.590" end="00:09:29.330" style="s2">thinking about well like we still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.870" end="00:09:31.910" style="s2">know what what the hell the internet</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.330" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">really is right like we still don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.910" end="00:09:36.770" style="s2">know exactly what it is but I think if</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">we look at it like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.770" end="00:09:43.130" style="s2">collective mind of some kind right I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:45.230" style="s2">think we can like we can we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.130" end="00:09:47.420" style="s2">put a metaphor like that and we could</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.230" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">say that like Peter&#39;s in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.420" end="00:09:54.500" style="s2">is he&#39;s a consolidation of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">voice that spoke something that was true</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.500" end="00:10:00.260" style="s2">but unarticulated great and he in talent</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:03.290" style="s2">and now he&#39;s creating kind of a new</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.260" end="00:10:05.840" style="s2">neural net and then all of a sudden like</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.290" end="00:10:07.190" style="s2">you know who&#39;ll be going along and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.840" end="00:10:10.070" style="s2">they&#39;ll get it an interviewer or</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.190" end="00:10:13.970" style="s2">somebody that like like you know is just</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.070" end="00:10:16.130" style="s2">shitty with him or more like bashes him</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.970" end="00:10:17.690" style="s2">or something like that and it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.130" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">it and this is what I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.690" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">kind of what it&#39;s cool about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:23.690" style="s2">Internet or a really good thing about</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:27.140" style="s2">the Internet is that his first response</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.690" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">often is kind of like you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.140" end="00:10:32.600" style="s2">tell it&#39;s like he&#39;s kind of irritated</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:35.090" style="s2">right or like and rightly so I could get</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.600" end="00:10:37.520" style="s2">it and and a little bit grumpy or</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.090" end="00:10:40.550" style="s2">something like that and I saw some kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.520" end="00:10:43.580" style="s2">of interview like like like that a while</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.550" end="00:10:46.520" style="s2">ago and then I went and saw him speak in</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.580" end="00:10:49.990" style="s2">San Francisco and it was like a month</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.520" end="00:10:53.300" style="s2">later and he had basically taken that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.990" end="00:10:55.190" style="s2">situation right and he had brought it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.300" end="00:11:00.380" style="s2">into his thinking and he was working it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.190" end="00:11:02.540" style="s2">out right like to the crap out that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.380" end="00:11:06.890" style="s2">being video that was having comments on</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.540" end="00:11:08.750" style="s2">it and I&#39;m watching him like it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.890" end="00:11:11.900" style="s2">like I&#39;m almost watching the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.750" end="00:11:13.580" style="s2">thinking in some way right like he&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.900" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">first it&#39;s kind of a crash and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.580" end="00:11:17.870" style="s2">like a like a conflict and then he he</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:19.880" style="s2">actually kind of goes huh well what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.870" end="00:11:22.580" style="s2">this like and he has more Congress and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.880" end="00:11:25.010" style="s2">you see him working it out with people</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.580" end="00:11:25.490" style="s2">and he takes it seriously and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.010" end="00:11:27.050" style="s2">opened</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.490" end="00:11:28.760" style="s2">being affected and impacted and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.050" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">watching and then watching him on stage</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.760" end="00:11:33.770" style="s2">work that out and I thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:38.300" style="s2">I&#39;m like oh my god this is this is like</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.770" end="00:11:39.709" style="s2">I think I&#39;m watching the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.300" end="00:11:43.940" style="s2">what something like the Internet can</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.709" end="00:11:46.130" style="s2">actually be right of like a thought like</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.940" end="00:11:48.500" style="s2">an insight is being worked out and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.130" end="00:11:52.250" style="s2">you&#39;re watching it go through all of its</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.500" end="00:11:53.860" style="s2">stages and I got I so there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.250" end="00:11:56.420" style="s2">different levels at which I&#39;m like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.860" end="00:11:59.089" style="s2">observing him it&#39;s like him I like his</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.420" end="00:12:01.370" style="s2">stuff like it&#39;s competitive ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.089" end="00:12:04.580" style="s2">challenging but there&#39;s also the medium</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.370" end="00:12:06.589" style="s2">that is happening in there&#39;s watching</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.580" end="00:12:08.450" style="s2">the way the world is responding and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.589" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">kind of world is revealed through that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.450" end="00:12:15.220" style="s2">and then watching actually if you is him</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:17.000" style="s2">being a concentrated sight</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.220" end="00:12:19.250" style="s2">metaphorically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.000" end="00:12:21.649" style="s2">well maybe even technically speaking who</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.250" end="00:12:25.250" style="s2">knows of where you&#39;re watching the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.649" end="00:12:28.339" style="s2">actually think or a parts world mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.250" end="00:12:31.880" style="s2">actually occur and I can I feel excited</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.339" end="00:12:34.010" style="s2">about about that yeah I&#39;m just like oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.880" end="00:12:35.480" style="s2">like I just want to start to I just want</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.010" end="00:12:37.570" style="s2">to start podcasts and I want to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.480" end="00:12:40.040" style="s2">this conversation with you and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.570" end="00:12:42.380" style="s2">this idea that calm people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.040" end="00:12:44.630" style="s2">interested in conversations and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.380" end="00:12:46.550" style="s2">interested in long conversations of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.630" end="00:12:50.209" style="s2">working it out and watching them and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.550" end="00:12:56.089" style="s2">engaging them and that that&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.209" end="00:12:58.550" style="s2">where it&#39;s a it&#39;s a way where I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.089" end="00:13:01.820" style="s2">technology is providing something that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.550" end="00:13:05.170" style="s2">is is is a platform for something less</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.820" end="00:13:09.260" style="s2">technological in the sense that like</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.170" end="00:13:12.140" style="s2">YouTube and podcasts now that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.260" end="00:13:14.680" style="s2">disconnected from the network&#39;s don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.140" end="00:13:17.270" style="s2">have to be like little five minute clips</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.680" end="00:13:21.110" style="s2">right into they don&#39;t have to have like</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.270" end="00:13:23.300" style="s2">a you know they don&#39;t have to shave it</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.110" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">down and prove a point or something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.300" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">that literally that&#39;s more technological</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:30.829" style="s2">from what the way the Heidegger would</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:34.130" style="s2">define it like tech me city but</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.829" end="00:13:36.500" style="s2">technology is creating a platform for</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.130" end="00:13:38.839" style="s2">something less technological to happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.500" end="00:13:39.370" style="s2">called the meandering of a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.839" end="00:13:40.900" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.370" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">get out and kind of going into the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.900" end="00:13:47.230" style="s2">of these things and it&#39;s it&#39;s that those</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:49.810" style="s2">conversations that are starting to speak</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.230" end="00:13:52.270" style="s2">to people thus the dark web right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.810" end="00:13:59.170" style="s2">you see and all that so that part of its</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.270" end="00:14:01.089" style="s2">really fascinating to me - cool so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.170" end="00:14:02.440" style="s2">you broke it down into four parts I want</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.089" end="00:14:05.070" style="s2">to work them back with you I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.440" end="00:14:10.089" style="s2">that&#39;s a I think that&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.070" end="00:14:11.980" style="s2">fascinating framework and I like for for</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.089" end="00:14:15.610" style="s2">the three dimensions of space and one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">time right the four dimensions is a nice</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.610" end="00:14:19.690" style="s2">number of dimensions through which to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:23.050" style="s2">look to through which to look at things</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.690" end="00:14:27.070" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got and I&#39;m gonna do it in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.050" end="00:14:30.610" style="s2">different order right is that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.070" end="00:14:33.220" style="s2">a culture all right you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.610" end="00:14:35.650" style="s2">collective group of people each one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.220" end="00:14:38.410" style="s2">which has their own representation</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.650" end="00:14:42.089" style="s2">they&#39;re part of a larger cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.410" end="00:14:45.550" style="s2">conversation the self that they are</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.089" end="00:14:47.080" style="s2">comes about inside of a culture and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.550" end="00:14:50.260" style="s2">it&#39;s shaped by that culture and so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.080" end="00:14:53.410" style="s2">could say that it&#39;s it&#39;s appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.260" end="00:14:55.450" style="s2">think about each individual self as part</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.410" end="00:14:59.290" style="s2">of a culture as long as you understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.450" end="00:15:04.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not like a cell in an organism but</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.290" end="00:15:07.570" style="s2">more like a self in in an ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.270" end="00:15:09.250" style="s2">that self is adapted to the ecology so</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.570" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this ecology all of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.250" end="00:15:18.670" style="s2">different parts and it&#39;s evolving as an</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:23.020" style="s2">ecology yeah yeah yeah and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.670" end="00:15:25.089" style="s2">this medium this technology within this</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.290" end="00:17:16.449" style="s2">and up until literally five ten years</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.449" end="00:17:27.459" style="s2">ecology shared were sound bites yep</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.510" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">totally and this medium we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.459" end="00:17:33.400" style="s2">medium that allows for the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:37.169" style="s2">that we used to have in one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.400" end="00:17:37.169" style="s2">conversation where we could meander</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.320" end="00:17:42.970" style="s2">we&#39;ve now got these ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.780" end="00:17:48.010" style="s2">conversations which are deep and wide</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.970" end="00:17:50.260" style="s2">and far ranging and incremental and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.010" end="00:17:51.700" style="s2">recursive this person talks to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.260" end="00:17:53.710" style="s2">person talks to this person text and</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.710" end="00:17:58.750" style="s2">this big conversation that we can all</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.620" end="00:18:01.870" style="s2">participate in to different degrees and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.750" end="00:18:04.090" style="s2">that so we&#39;ve got the the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.870" end="00:18:05.370" style="s2">then we&#39;ve got this medium and that meet</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.090" end="00:18:08.790" style="s2">the medium is causing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.370" end="00:18:12.710" style="s2">culture to interact in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.790" end="00:18:18.120" style="s2">yeah yeah and then you&#39;ve got this one</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.710" end="00:18:20.700" style="s2">person yeah speaking his perspective</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.450" end="00:18:33.660" style="s2">I always say that the first one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.920" end="00:18:36.510" style="s2">teach work with my clients I would say</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.660" end="00:18:38.370" style="s2">the first rule of leadership is turn</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.510" end="00:18:41.460" style="s2">around yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.370" end="00:18:43.980" style="s2">is anyone following yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.460" end="00:18:45.960" style="s2">first rule of leadership is like if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.980" end="00:18:47.790" style="s2">want to Lee if you want to be a leader</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.960" end="00:18:48.179" style="s2">you actually have to have people follow</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.790" end="00:18:52.550" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.179" end="00:18:56.520" style="s2">it has to be able to say hey I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.550" end="00:18:59.300" style="s2">yeah does anyone want to listen yep</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.520" end="00:19:05.179" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got this one guy who&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.300" end="00:19:09.420" style="s2">and all these people are listening yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.179" end="00:19:12.630" style="s2">yes and they&#39;re like talk more right</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.420" end="00:19:14.280" style="s2">here here here&#39;s $80,000 a month that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.630" end="00:19:20.610" style="s2">we&#39;re just gonna give you to keep</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.280" end="00:19:25.400" style="s2">talking yeah totally totally</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.610" end="00:19:29.190" style="s2">yes right and so he&#39;s talking and he is</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.400" end="00:19:33.570" style="s2">sharing his perspective and other people</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.190" end="00:19:36.890" style="s2">are sharing their perspective yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.570" end="00:19:39.000" style="s2">and in the process there&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.890" end="00:19:41.100" style="s2">kind of two levels of things going on</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.000" end="00:19:42.780" style="s2">one all of the different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.100" end="00:19:44.610" style="s2">kind of get to come into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.780" end="00:19:45.809" style="s2">conversation and so you&#39;re watching a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.610" end="00:19:48.510" style="s2">large conversation with lots of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.809" end="00:19:50.820" style="s2">different perspectives yeah and any</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.510" end="00:19:55.380" style="s2">perspectives that actually speak for</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.820" end="00:19:57.450" style="s2">other people right especially in</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.380" end="00:20:01.020" style="s2">Jordan&#39;s case like he&#39;s saying things</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.450" end="00:20:05.160" style="s2">and people are going I didn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.020" end="00:20:08.130" style="s2">to articulate that yes I did know that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.160" end="00:20:10.530" style="s2">actually felt and thought that thing or</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.130" end="00:20:14.040" style="s2">some variation of that thing I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.530" end="00:20:14.940" style="s2">was kind of subtext and I at times I</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.040" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.940" end="00:20:20.340" style="s2">I feel something and then but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:23.250" style="s2">saying it and I&#39;m identifying that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.340" end="00:20:25.290" style="s2">I resonate with that yes and so many</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.250" end="00:20:27.270" style="s2">people are doing that that he&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.290" end="00:20:29.940" style="s2">an icon like an archetype in his own</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.270" end="00:20:31.860" style="s2">form in this conversation if the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.940" end="00:20:34.440" style="s2">conversation were a plot or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.860" end="00:20:36.090" style="s2">conversation were a story like he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.440" end="00:20:38.460" style="s2">character that people are identifying</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.090" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">with because they identify with that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.460" end="00:20:41.010" style="s2">character that&#39;s the kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:42.360" style="s2">that they think that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.010" end="00:20:43.710" style="s2">concern that they have that&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.360" end="00:20:45.210" style="s2">of mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.710" end="00:20:47.430" style="s2">and then other people are doing in so</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.210" end="00:20:51.150" style="s2">now you get to watch the different</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.430" end="00:20:53.670" style="s2">people play the things out and so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.150" end="00:20:56.100" style="s2">culture through the technology and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.670" end="00:20:58.860" style="s2">individuals now get to play out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.100" end="00:21:02.520" style="s2">organism ecology becomes represented</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.860" end="00:21:05.280" style="s2">into like a living play where it used to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.520" end="00:21:07.320" style="s2">be a dramatist would create a plot and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.280" end="00:21:10.100" style="s2">the actors would play out the things so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.320" end="00:21:13.430" style="s2">that we as the culture could watch it</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.100" end="00:21:16.650" style="s2">but now it&#39;s spontaneous human</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.430" end="00:21:18.510" style="s2">conversation happening at these levels</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.650" end="00:21:21.210" style="s2">and something about Jordan Peterson that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.510" end="00:21:24.150" style="s2">clues into it so i&#39;m i recited your four</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.210" end="00:21:28.350" style="s2">areas i&#39;m not sure if i got them right</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.150" end="00:21:31.830" style="s2">from your perspective i I think yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.350" end="00:21:33.150" style="s2">think you totally got it right and when</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.830" end="00:21:36.890" style="s2">it was compelling to me and just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.150" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">little bit of a backdrop is is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.890" end="00:21:42.930" style="s2">so I&#39;ve recently been kind of realizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:45.060" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been just intrigued with</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.930" end="00:21:46.650" style="s2">Heidegger for years now and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.060" end="00:21:48.690" style="s2">really haven&#39;t been able to tell you why</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.650" end="00:21:51.570" style="s2">a map but I think I&#39;ve recently</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.690" end="00:21:53.850" style="s2">discovered why and it&#39;s actually part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.570" end="00:21:55.500" style="s2">it part of it has to do with actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.850" end="00:21:58.230" style="s2">what what Peterson was doing because</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.500" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">Peterson is so many ways doing something</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.230" end="00:22:02.160" style="s2">very similar and he didn&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">Heidegger so like after I think he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.160" end="00:22:06.330" style="s2">his book or something like that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:10.050" style="s2">doing very much the same way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.330" end="00:22:12.180" style="s2">observing things and articulating them</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.050" end="00:22:13.490" style="s2">or engaging them in at the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.180" end="00:22:15.990" style="s2">level this whole thing about like</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.490" end="00:22:19.170" style="s2">reality isn&#39;t a bunch of determined</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.990" end="00:22:22.130" style="s2">things that&#39;s you have to work at doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.170" end="00:22:24.750" style="s2">that but like reality is experienced as</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.130" end="00:22:26.610" style="s2">phenomenological and unpacking that Reno</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.750" end="00:22:28.770" style="s2">pack him and Heidegger do it in</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.610" end="00:22:29.700" style="s2">different ways but essentially</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.770" end="00:22:34.530" style="s2">they&#39;re pointing to something very</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.700" end="00:22:39.030" style="s2">similar and I now that Heidegger a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.530" end="00:22:40.470" style="s2">of a lot of like the black notebooks and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.030" end="00:22:42.870" style="s2">a lot of things about Heidegger that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.470" end="00:22:44.850" style="s2">warrant either published or published or</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.870" end="00:22:47.790" style="s2">translated in English have all been</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.850" end="00:22:49.020" style="s2">translated now and so now a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.790" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">things that were mysterious about</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.020" end="00:22:53.580" style="s2">Heidegger and weird and didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:55.530" style="s2">connect there&#39;s a you&#39;re starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.580" end="00:22:57.960" style="s2">people that draw out the themes and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.530" end="00:23:02.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a book that recently came out</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.960" end="00:23:03.780" style="s2">it&#39;s called Otto theology and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.310" end="00:23:06.930" style="s2">remember the name of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.780" end="00:23:10.290" style="s2">ontology and theology yeah and he said</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.930" end="00:23:13.560" style="s2">he it did he went in there and he talked</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.290" end="00:23:15.930" style="s2">about he you saw the whole corpus of his</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.560" end="00:23:20.130" style="s2">work having one thread and it had to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.930" end="00:23:24.290" style="s2">with essentially it had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.130" end="00:23:28.110" style="s2">technology or Tecna city and how</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.290" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">technology he was afraid that technology</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.110" end="00:23:34.140" style="s2">was a kind of Anto theology that self</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:36.510" style="s2">concealed itself ray in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.140" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">it would conceal itself into oblivion</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.510" end="00:23:43.380" style="s2">right artificial intelligence machine</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:46.050" style="s2">all of the the mythology about you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.380" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">the matrix you know with repetition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.050" end="00:23:51.000" style="s2">or durability being as standing in</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">reserved or being or conception of being</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.000" end="00:23:55.590" style="s2">as being something that could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:59.250" style="s2">optimized utilized and we&#39;re included in</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.590" end="00:24:02.010" style="s2">that now and what he was seeking to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.250" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">was to reformat education and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.010" end="00:24:06.300" style="s2">what his involvement with the Nazis were</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:08.730" style="s2">but he was really upset because they</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.300" end="00:24:09.750" style="s2">were they didn&#39;t listen to him so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.730" end="00:24:11.640" style="s2">like this is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.750" end="00:24:13.050" style="s2">this isn&#39;t like what what it is and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.640" end="00:24:16.680" style="s2">he realized that there wasn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.050" end="00:24:20.250" style="s2">fundamental ontology but but that on top</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.680" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">that being never disclosed fully but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.250" end="00:24:23.790" style="s2">had epochs in which it did were the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:25.650" style="s2">higher and the lower onto a theology</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.790" end="00:24:29.190" style="s2">where a philosopher was able to like</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.650" end="00:24:32.160" style="s2">speak both of them the big view and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.190" end="00:24:34.920" style="s2">micro view at once and those points in</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.160" end="00:24:37.140" style="s2">history was the unfolding of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.920" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">understanding of being and he realized</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.140" end="00:24:42.150" style="s2">that there was no ultimate understanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:48.800" style="s2">but that was the way it unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.150" end="00:24:52.910" style="s2">and that he is antidote to Tecna city is</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.800" end="00:24:55.650" style="s2">to through education is defined</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.910" end="00:24:58.560" style="s2">education to reveal being in its</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.650" end="00:25:01.020" style="s2">transcendent element right to not make</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.560" end="00:25:04.260" style="s2">being something that we totally consumed</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.020" end="00:25:07.290" style="s2">for our own optimization right but like</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.260" end="00:25:09.780" style="s2">the roots don&#39;t like to educate people</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.290" end="00:25:12.900" style="s2">and to make education be something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.780" end="00:25:16.590" style="s2">actually reveals a way for being to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.900" end="00:25:18.420" style="s2">withdraw and to speak to us right in</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.590" end="00:25:24.150" style="s2">that in a restore kind of a theological</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.420" end="00:25:28.500" style="s2">relationship in a certain way so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.150" end="00:25:31.080" style="s2">last bit that last pitch raises a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.500" end="00:25:35.250" style="s2">question for me and I am and I lost it I</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.080" end="00:25:39.270" style="s2">lost there right that last bit so so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.250" end="00:25:43.430" style="s2">going to talk about Sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.270" end="00:25:50.610" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and Heidegger idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.430" end="00:25:55.980" style="s2">like the self or being yeah right which</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.610" end="00:25:59.610" style="s2">we you could say reify into a self and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.980" end="00:26:01.980" style="s2">that self is part of the use it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.610" end="00:26:03.540" style="s2">how does this self allow us to move in</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.980" end="00:26:05.880" style="s2">the world given the nature of the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.540" end="00:26:09.060" style="s2">and so we&#39;re optimizing the self for use</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.880" end="00:26:12.180" style="s2">in the world and in the process the self</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.060" end="00:26:17.550" style="s2">that we create gets bounded in its use</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.180" end="00:26:21.750" style="s2">and disconnected from the being yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.550" end="00:26:27.150" style="s2">and that you like that that enclosure</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.750" end="00:26:29.190" style="s2">gets concealed yes yes as just this and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.150" end="00:26:31.110" style="s2">it loses connection with this and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.190" end="00:26:33.270" style="s2">way that it does it is this is all there</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.110" end="00:26:37.890" style="s2">is and so it conceals that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.270" end="00:26:40.230" style="s2">concealing yeah yep an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.890" end="00:26:43.770" style="s2">he would say it&#39;s like where he saw that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.230" end="00:26:44.940" style="s2">it The Epoch be a particular epoch that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.770" end="00:26:49.650" style="s2">were in what he&#39;s calling</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.940" end="00:26:52.680" style="s2">tecna&#39;s to be right or the paradigm that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.650" end="00:26:54.450" style="s2">we&#39;re in is being as technology or Tecna</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.680" end="00:26:55.480" style="s2">city or in framings another way it puts</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.450" end="00:26:58.390" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.480" end="00:27:00.820" style="s2">he said that he saw it change when he</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.390" end="00:27:04.810" style="s2">saw what happened with the Nazis to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.820" end="00:27:07.270" style="s2">with the Jews he&#39;s like we went he said</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.810" end="00:27:09.460" style="s2">we went from subject object where the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.270" end="00:27:10.840" style="s2">subject the canteen thing alike would</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.460" end="00:27:12.970" style="s2">like or the Cartesian thing where the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.840" end="00:27:15.610" style="s2">subject is trying to overcome the object</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.970" end="00:27:17.800" style="s2">or its dominance and he said like when</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.610" end="00:27:19.870" style="s2">he saw the thing with the Jews where</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.800" end="00:27:21.550" style="s2">they like took away their name put</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.870" end="00:27:23.410" style="s2">numbers on them and exterminated him</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.550" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">he&#39;s like in that moment like what was</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.410" end="00:27:27.670" style="s2">the understanding that even made that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:30.580" style="s2">possible right and he&#39;s not talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.670" end="00:27:31.750" style="s2">about technology as technological things</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.580" end="00:27:34.900" style="s2">he&#39;s not like it he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.750" end="00:27:39.250" style="s2">anti-technology what he&#39;s pointing to is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.900" end="00:27:42.430" style="s2">the understanding of the category of all</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.250" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">categories that then influences</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.430" end="00:27:48.460" style="s2">everything inside of that category which</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:50.170" style="s2">is being he&#39;s saying switched to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.460" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">technological point of view or ethnicity</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.170" end="00:27:58.750" style="s2">and so what&#39;s interesting to me okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:03.250" style="s2">about about this thing about like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.750" end="00:28:07.630" style="s2">medium in which people aren&#39;t like like</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.250" end="00:28:09.310" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris and all</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.630" end="00:28:12.670" style="s2">the people that were calling the dark</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.310" end="00:28:15.160" style="s2">web now right what&#39;s fascinating to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.670" end="00:28:22.090" style="s2">as technology has brought this platform</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.160" end="00:28:24.550" style="s2">up for conversations that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.090" end="00:28:27.280" style="s2">not mediated right they&#39;re more raw</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.550" end="00:28:29.050" style="s2">right they&#39;re not technological whereas</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.280" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">like the news is a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.050" end="00:28:32.350" style="s2">technological it&#39;s more like okay we</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.670" end="00:28:34.530" style="s2">have five minutes there&#39;s a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.350" end="00:28:37.210" style="s2">right we have to make it sensational</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.530" end="00:28:40.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s more like standing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.210" end="00:28:43.090" style="s2">reserved optimization right whereas now</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.200" end="00:28:45.190" style="s2">technology in this new medium is</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.090" end="00:28:49.810" style="s2">actually created a platform for</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.190" end="00:28:53.230" style="s2">something less complete less ordered</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.810" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">more meandering right more like</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.230" end="00:28:59.980" style="s2">something untechnical to be spoken and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.860" end="00:29:03.310" style="s2">for people to be responding to and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.980" end="00:29:05.710" style="s2">think that the word technology and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.310" end="00:29:08.020" style="s2">something untechnical coming together</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.710" end="00:29:09.400" style="s2">that that&#39;s speaking to people and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.020" end="00:29:16.120" style="s2">way that you&#39;re talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.400" end="00:29:17.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s utterly it&#39;s I still haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.120" end="00:29:19.810" style="s2">formed all my thoughts about it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.680" end="00:29:24.550" style="s2">like I think it&#39;s really significant</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.810" end="00:29:26.170" style="s2">thing is really significant that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.550" end="00:29:29.020" style="s2">people can listen into a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.170" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">right and be altered by that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.020" end="00:29:32.980" style="s2">conversation and have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:34.840" style="s2">about that and that that&#39;s available and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.980" end="00:29:37.690" style="s2">the technology allowed that for to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.840" end="00:29:39.340" style="s2">happen and that that&#39;s what art where</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.690" end="00:29:42.550" style="s2">our attention is drawn and that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.340" end="00:29:44.140" style="s2">feeding us and influencing us and more</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.550" end="00:29:50.140" style="s2">and more people I think is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.140" end="00:29:57.280" style="s2">extraordinary yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.140" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">crazy time be alive you know so many</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.280" end="00:30:00.820" style="s2">places to go with that so emplace to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:02.980" style="s2">with that I want I want to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.820" end="00:30:10.300" style="s2">your earlier point and keep that in so</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.980" end="00:30:14.350" style="s2">if so vocabu-larry vocabu-larry - if</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.300" end="00:30:16.210" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna say the technology if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.350" end="00:30:18.990" style="s2">want to talk about technology and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.210" end="00:30:22.600" style="s2">differentiate from tech Nissa t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.990" end="00:30:25.450" style="s2">okay so for example we&#39;re using video</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.600" end="00:30:29.800" style="s2">conferencing right video conferencing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.450" end="00:30:31.660" style="s2">a technology yeah okay and within this</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.800" end="00:30:36.400" style="s2">technology there are certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.660" end="00:30:37.560" style="s2">are limits of the technology and we work</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.400" end="00:30:40.750" style="s2">within the limits of the technology</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.560" end="00:30:44.800" style="s2">right for example right now you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.750" end="00:30:50.740" style="s2">see what I&#39;m doing with my hands yes and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.800" end="00:30:53.620" style="s2">because you can&#39;t see the gestures you</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.740" end="00:30:55.750" style="s2">can&#39;t see it so that changes the nature</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.620" end="00:31:00.750" style="s2">of the conversation that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.750" end="00:31:03.550" style="s2">and we could say the technology has</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.750" end="00:31:05.530" style="s2">constraints to it and within those</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.550" end="00:31:10.510" style="s2">constraints certain things live and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.530" end="00:31:13.780" style="s2">certain things go away yeah yeah now for</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.510" end="00:31:17.230" style="s2">vocabulary purposes would it can we go</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.780" end="00:31:20.770" style="s2">with the idea that the technology is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.230" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">actual thing the limitations of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.770" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">medium that were</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:29.170" style="s2">and what that facilitates or doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:31.270" style="s2">facilitate is the Tecna City I and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.170" end="00:31:33.850" style="s2">would say yes and let me work that a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.270" end="00:31:38.650" style="s2">little bit I think it&#39;s also if we say</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.850" end="00:31:41.350" style="s2">that those limits become begin to shape</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.650" end="00:31:44.110" style="s2">our understanding and the wiki that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.350" end="00:31:47.890" style="s2">then understand and we don&#39;t notice it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.110" end="00:31:49.450" style="s2">that&#39;s ethnicity that&#39;s look yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.890" end="00:31:51.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that&#39;s absolutely key</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.450" end="00:31:54.940" style="s2">because you and I have these</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.490" end="00:31:58.750" style="s2">conversations and I become aware of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.940" end="00:32:02.470" style="s2">how I&#39;m using my body just becomes less</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.750" end="00:32:05.820" style="s2">important and so I start to adjust the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.470" end="00:32:08.170" style="s2">way I communicate for the parts which</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.820" end="00:32:09.550" style="s2">within the constraints of our medium and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.170" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">then that just becomes part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.550" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">conversation and that gets forgotten it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:15.700" style="s2">gets concealed yeah and to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:19.240" style="s2">that we&#39;re stuck in this it gets</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.700" end="00:32:22.140" style="s2">concealed that it&#39;s concealed to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.240" end="00:32:26.170" style="s2">back into this language okay so so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.140" end="00:32:31.960" style="s2">the technology of network television and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.170" end="00:32:34.120" style="s2">network news yep right went from we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.960" end="00:32:38.220" style="s2">got three or four major channels and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.120" end="00:32:42.100" style="s2">news is really one hour a day yeah yep</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.220" end="00:32:45.850" style="s2">into the area into the era of 24-hour</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.100" end="00:32:48.880" style="s2">cable news yep in which case there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.850" end="00:32:52.660" style="s2">just more conversation and then we get</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.880" end="00:32:56.650" style="s2">in we get into the the debate format as</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.660" end="00:32:58.330" style="s2">the news methodology where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.650" end="00:33:01.630" style="s2">okay let&#39;s take a hot topic let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.330" end="00:33:03.280" style="s2">people on either side they argue and now</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.630" end="00:33:06.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve got competing narratives because</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.280" end="00:33:09.250" style="s2">it&#39;s very sticky and and that&#39;s the news</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.580" end="00:33:12.510" style="s2">the technician that comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.250" end="00:33:15.940" style="s2">network and the cable news network</p>

<p begin="00:33:20.500" end="00:33:23.830" style="s2">a very limited set of ideas it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.300" end="00:33:26.260" style="s2">same people over and over it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.830" end="00:33:27.640" style="s2">sets of ideas clashing and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.260" end="00:33:29.920" style="s2">world and that&#39;s the world we&#39;re living</p>

<p begin="00:38:15.700" end="00:38:21.880" style="s2">we&#39;re teaching you to be a good self is</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:24.460" style="s2">one that has taken on this structure</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.880" end="00:38:26.620" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a preformed structure we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.460" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">going to give it to you your job is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.620" end="00:38:30.550" style="s2">take yourself conform it into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:32.680" style="s2">structure our teachers are designed to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.550" end="00:38:34.780" style="s2">get people and the idea of a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.680" end="00:38:38.340" style="s2">education is that when you come out of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.780" end="00:38:42.790" style="s2">the education you fit into the Machine</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.340" end="00:38:47.010" style="s2">right and you have the knowledge yet</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.790" end="00:38:49.950" style="s2">right and that can be you could say a</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.010" end="00:38:52.180" style="s2">technological or a technical education</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.950" end="00:38:55.360" style="s2">where we teach you to work in a factory</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.180" end="00:38:57.220" style="s2">we teach you to be a secretary we teach</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.360" end="00:39:00.340" style="s2">you to be a scientist we teach these</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.220" end="00:39:02.380" style="s2">things or it can notice yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.340" end="00:39:05.860" style="s2">just notice implicitly like without</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.380" end="00:39:07.840" style="s2">probably even explicitly knowing or</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.860" end="00:39:10.120" style="s2">understanding this the way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.840" end="00:39:12.910" style="s2">talking about notice how much order is</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.120" end="00:39:17.380" style="s2">involved with that in a repetition right</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.910" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s the essence of getting techni</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.380" end="00:39:22.510" style="s2">city or in framing which is where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:24.700" style="s2">the view where the only thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.510" end="00:39:27.400" style="s2">begin to see is that which is orderable</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.700" end="00:39:32.440" style="s2">and optimized for immediate consumption</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.400" end="00:39:36.130" style="s2">and yes okay and did you say in framing</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.440" end="00:39:40.150" style="s2">yeah yeah and did that I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.130" end="00:39:43.420" style="s2">totally this is a thing so I I now I now</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.150" end="00:39:46.450" style="s2">have a peg in my mind for in framing I</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.420" end="00:39:49.210" style="s2">have some idea that that in framing is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.450" end="00:39:52.510" style="s2">way of like taking techni city and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.210" end="00:39:54.580" style="s2">turning it into a narrative form yep</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.510" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">right and if you can create a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.580" end="00:40:00.070" style="s2">form that captures the techni city that</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:02.620" style="s2">fits into the technology yes it takes</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.070" end="00:40:05.490" style="s2">the culture and has the self fit into</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.620" end="00:40:08.140" style="s2">the existing culture yes the existing</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.490" end="00:40:09.800" style="s2">ecology which is all concealed and which</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.140" end="00:40:12.290" style="s2">is for consumption in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.800" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">say right and natural are you it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.290" end="00:40:17.960" style="s2">use right and that&#39;s how you can be get</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:21.140" style="s2">these awful places like Plano Texas</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.960" end="00:40:23.990" style="s2">we&#39;re all there are are shopping malls</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.140" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">there&#39;s not in shopping malls and chain</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.990" end="00:40:32.150" style="s2">restaurants like literally they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:33.530" style="s2">there is all about consumerism 40% of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.150" end="00:40:36.670" style="s2">the population or something is like</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.530" end="00:40:40.060" style="s2">hooked on on opiates right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.670" end="00:40:44.450" style="s2">absolutely I go there and it&#39;s ah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.060" end="00:40:48.140" style="s2">awful if no one is like walking around</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.450" end="00:40:50.690" style="s2">going this is this is awful it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.140" end="00:40:53.840" style="s2">an oblivious to it we begin to not be</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.690" end="00:40:55.970" style="s2">able to see the jump to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.840" end="00:40:57.590" style="s2">we have adapted ourself into the in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.970" end="00:41:00.020" style="s2">framing to the degree that our self</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.590" end="00:41:02.690" style="s2">actually fits in the techni city yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.020" end="00:41:05.120" style="s2">then it becomes second nature it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.690" end="00:41:08.390" style="s2">the way that it is and we simply work</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.120" end="00:41:10.700" style="s2">within that framework yeah and and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.390" end="00:41:13.640" style="s2">beingness and this is like because</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.700" end="00:41:18.830" style="s2">because as I think about Heidegger it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.640" end="00:41:21.590" style="s2">it&#39;s this what is being beyond that what</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.830" end="00:41:23.170" style="s2">is being that it can be that and what</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.590" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">else could it be</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.170" end="00:41:28.010" style="s2">exactly and right there what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:30.500" style="s2">saying what we&#39;re saying is that when</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.010" end="00:41:32.600" style="s2">you confront being one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.500" end="00:41:34.430" style="s2">you nub you confront being is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.600" end="00:41:38.270" style="s2">there&#39;s something about it that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.430" end="00:41:41.000" style="s2">withdrawn from your intelligibility or</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.270" end="00:41:43.700" style="s2">is that goes beyond the limits of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.000" end="00:41:48.830" style="s2">understanding but it shows itself or</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.700" end="00:41:51.860" style="s2">stands forth as it is in its not being</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.830" end="00:41:54.350" style="s2">completely revealed to your mind so for</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.860" end="00:41:55.610" style="s2">example like like intimacy I think is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.350" end="00:41:57.580" style="s2">one of the places where that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.610" end="00:42:00.200" style="s2">really alive is that when people have</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.580" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">intimacy there is this experience of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.200" end="00:42:05.450" style="s2">like it&#39;s not an experience of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:07.820" style="s2">collapsing collapsing distance and being</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.450" end="00:42:10.520" style="s2">informed about but informed about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.820" end="00:42:12.650" style="s2">other and in like a nap or something no</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.520" end="00:42:14.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re looking at just there</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.650" end="00:42:17.540" style="s2">and you see this human being you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.840" end="00:42:20.660" style="s2">oh my god you&#39;re you&#39;re someone you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.540" end="00:42:23.360" style="s2">more than the thing that I could be</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.660" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">informed about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.360" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">a set of ideas of who you could be but</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:30.980" style="s2">you were actually more than that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:34.340" style="s2">and that intimacy with life with spirit</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.980" end="00:42:38.990" style="s2">with like this aliveness this being is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.340" end="00:42:41.030" style="s2">that experience itself is more than what</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.990" end="00:42:43.580" style="s2">we can see in our in framing from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.030" end="00:42:49.300" style="s2">techni city as based in the technology</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.580" end="00:42:53.240" style="s2">and right that or that more gives a self</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.300" end="00:42:58.130" style="s2">that is also more than the one that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.240" end="00:43:00.530" style="s2">are on your phone right great so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.130" end="00:43:03.440" style="s2">take this I want to call I want to take</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.530" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">the idea of world Inge yeah right right</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.440" end="00:43:09.530" style="s2">so there&#39;s being in the world yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:13.100" style="s2">being in the world that we encounter</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.530" end="00:43:14.780" style="s2">being through the in framing and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.100" end="00:43:16.460" style="s2">through what doesn&#39;t fit the in framing</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.780" end="00:43:19.340" style="s2">and then we have to create a new frame</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.460" end="00:43:22.820" style="s2">for that which we are encountering and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.340" end="00:43:24.860" style="s2">we world it like we world this though</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.820" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">the experience within the frame within</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.860" end="00:43:31.940" style="s2">the in frame within the tech Nyssa t and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:36.260" style="s2">when we encounter the chaos beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.940" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">order of the in frame when we encounter</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.260" end="00:43:43.880" style="s2">the chaos we have a choice we can either</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:45.830" style="s2">demonize the chaos which we could say is</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.880" end="00:43:48.650" style="s2">a way of taking an in framing that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.830" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">already have and the existing story</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.650" end="00:43:52.520" style="s2">that&#39;s within our frame in which we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">within our frame we have good and bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.520" end="00:43:59.150" style="s2">yep yeah and we take the we take the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:44:01.490" style="s2">ultimate other that&#39;s that chaos that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.150" end="00:44:05.720" style="s2">thing that doesn&#39;t fit in our frame and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.490" end="00:44:08.900" style="s2">we reduce it down into the evil the bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.720" end="00:44:11.480" style="s2">thing within our friend yep exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.900" end="00:44:13.820" style="s2">take the fullness of the unknown of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.480" end="00:44:16.760" style="s2">other and this never more true than in</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.820" end="00:44:19.160" style="s2">relationship yep totally right never</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.760" end="00:44:24.380" style="s2">more true than in relationship yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.160" end="00:44:29.900" style="s2">other that vast unknown Ness of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.380" end="00:44:34.500" style="s2">other yeah like you know my wife and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.900" end="00:44:39.450" style="s2">10 years now yeah dating 17</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.500" end="00:44:47.030" style="s2">like when I&#39;m present to what is unknown</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.450" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">in her when I test what I think is known</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.030" end="00:44:53.970" style="s2">and I say I think this I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:56.790" style="s2">thinking and feeling this not like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.970" end="00:45:02.310" style="s2">are thinking and feeling this aren&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.790" end="00:45:07.020" style="s2">yeah but I experience you as thinking or</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.310" end="00:45:09.570" style="s2">feeling this is that accurate does that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.020" end="00:45:13.560" style="s2">map for you how would you say it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.570" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">then she comes back and says this thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.560" end="00:45:25.230" style="s2">which I&#39;m like oh that is not within the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">realm of who I thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.230" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">you have now surprised me so this chaos</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.359" end="00:45:32.190" style="s2">I can deal with this unknown this thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">which does not fit my frame the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.190" end="00:45:40.200" style="s2">beingness of the world and especially as</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">embodied another human being another</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.200" end="00:45:46.170" style="s2">human being represents being like</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:50.760" style="s2">nothing else because it can speak and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.170" end="00:45:55.290" style="s2">yet we listen we can so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.760" end="00:45:58.950" style="s2">beingness yeah and she appears to me she</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.290" end="00:46:01.740" style="s2">occurs for me as in a world like I see</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.950" end="00:46:06.450" style="s2">her and I interpret her into a known</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.740" end="00:46:10.290" style="s2">frame yeah yeah she&#39;s in the world I am</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.450" end="00:46:12.869" style="s2">world in her right right right that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.290" end="00:46:16.530" style="s2">an action that I am doing I am actively</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.869" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">interpreting her as something as if the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.530" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">something that I&#39;m interpreting her has</p>

<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:25.710" style="s2">right like I&#39;m taking this vastness this</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.220" end="00:46:29.369" style="s2">unknown &#39;no switch is so much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.710" end="00:46:33.000" style="s2">than my capacity to imagine her and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.369" end="00:46:35.970" style="s2">pretending I&#39;m world in her as if she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.000" end="00:46:39.270" style="s2">something that I can know yes right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.970" end="00:46:43.349" style="s2">then I&#39;m confronted with when I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.270" end="00:46:46.349" style="s2">of it I&#39;m and when I seek it and this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.349" end="00:46:47.910" style="s2">the hero going out into chaos looking to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.349" end="00:46:50.010" style="s2">go beyond order</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.910" end="00:46:54.089" style="s2">to go beyond order to go beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.010" end="00:46:55.710" style="s2">tyranny of its only this and everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.089" end="00:47:01.849" style="s2">that I know fits into my existing</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.710" end="00:47:05.430" style="s2">structures yep yep that this being is</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.849" end="00:47:08.940" style="s2">beyond my world</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.430" end="00:47:15.510" style="s2">yes and that encountering chaos as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.940" end="00:47:21.420" style="s2">hero yes yes means challenging the order</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.510" end="00:47:26.210" style="s2">yeah versus you challenging her forth to</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.420" end="00:47:32.730" style="s2">reveal the self saving of your own world</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.210" end="00:47:34.609" style="s2">right like you challenge like your world</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.730" end="00:47:39.720" style="s2">you could say that your world is</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.609" end="00:47:43.470" style="s2">untechnical in the sense that it&#39;s given</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.720" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">by a horizon of unknowability that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.470" end="00:47:48.780" style="s2">actually move toward right and what I</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:50.940" style="s2">think what we&#39;re talking about and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.780" end="00:47:54.569" style="s2">think this is part of what is speaking</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.940" end="00:47:56.279" style="s2">to people about Petersons in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.569" end="00:47:58.710" style="s2">like maybe they wouldn&#39;t put this way</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.279" end="00:48:02.730" style="s2">but I been thinking about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.710" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">in so many ways the way he&#39;s presenting</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.730" end="00:48:06.510" style="s2">life and this is where I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:10.220" style="s2">really where I see him and in Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.510" end="00:48:13.079" style="s2">doing much of very much similar things</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.220" end="00:48:17.010" style="s2">is he&#39;s presenting life in a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.079" end="00:48:19.049" style="s2">untechnical way right he&#39;s actually he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.010" end="00:48:21.809" style="s2">he&#39;s saying like no it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.049" end="00:48:24.779" style="s2">optimizing yourself and knowing for sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.809" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">it&#39;s actually if you want to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.779" end="00:48:31.819" style="s2">like handle your shit get ordered right</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:35.160" style="s2">but so that you can stand up and choose</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.819" end="00:48:37.710" style="s2">the KSR you&#39;re gonna move toward feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.160" end="00:48:40.109" style="s2">what moves you and let the unknown grab</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.630" end="00:49:21.749" style="s2">you said right right is speaking to some</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.469" end="00:49:24.900" style="s2">kind of awareness that there&#39;s a being</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.749" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">right that is other than what you think</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.900" end="00:49:28.019" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:32.660" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s already an openness to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.019" end="00:49:32.660" style="s2">you but when she says the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.079" end="00:49:39.630" style="s2">like what what is your world like what</p>

<p begin="00:49:55.049" end="00:50:00.089" style="s2">love about his what he might call his</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.420" end="00:50:02.459" style="s2">religious perspective is that this thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.089" end="00:50:03.989" style="s2">is so mysterious that to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.459" end="00:50:06.630" style="s2">we think that we can know it through</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.989" end="00:50:08.390" style="s2">science we&#39;re missing something yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.630" end="00:50:13.499" style="s2">the degree that I think that I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.390" end="00:50:17.609" style="s2">understand my wife yeah like and really</p>

<p begin="00:50:20.039" end="00:50:25.109" style="s2">know her well enough to guess how she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.170" end="00:50:28.769" style="s2">going to respond with relative accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.109" end="00:50:33.690" style="s2">to various kinds of things but to really</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.769" end="00:50:37.349" style="s2">get her when she&#39;s alive the more I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.690" end="00:50:42.089" style="s2">clean my room in this metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.349" end="00:50:47.190" style="s2">more I look at myself and notice where I</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.089" end="00:50:48.749" style="s2">am disordered why and and I love how he</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.190" end="00:50:50.609" style="s2">puts it he says there&#39;s things that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.749" end="00:50:53.339" style="s2">know that you need to do that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.609" end="00:50:58.739" style="s2">doing there are ways in which I know</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.339" end="00:51:01.619" style="s2">myself my world is disordered like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.739" end="00:51:04.769" style="s2">not handling something that I know I</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.619" end="00:51:09.539" style="s2">ought to handle the not handling of</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.769" end="00:51:13.550" style="s2">which causes me pain suffering and a</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.539" end="00:51:17.720" style="s2">lack of power yep yep</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.550" end="00:51:19.670" style="s2">if that&#39;s my room and I clean it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.720" end="00:51:22.130" style="s2">about starting with the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.670" end="00:51:23.750" style="s2">know I can put in order and clean up so</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.130" end="00:51:25.850" style="s2">that I then have the resources available</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.750" end="00:51:28.430" style="s2">to me so I have the power event so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.850" end="00:51:34.610" style="s2">have the alignment to push right so when</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.430" end="00:51:40.070" style="s2">I do that I become available yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.610" end="00:51:42.830" style="s2">experience what&#39;s new what&#39;s deeper</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.070" end="00:51:44.540" style="s2">what&#39;s better and I become available in</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.830" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">two ways like I think about intimacy I</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.540" end="00:51:49.970" style="s2">say intimacy is like I break it down</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:54.230" style="s2">into three steps you I share something</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.970" end="00:51:58.390" style="s2">value vulnerable I share something that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.230" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">I have not worked out so thoroughly that</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.390" end="00:52:04.280" style="s2">I&#39;m like solid about I share something</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:05.390" style="s2">that if and I define it that when I</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.280" end="00:52:07.790" style="s2">share something vulnerable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.390" end="00:52:12.980" style="s2">something that if you were to judge me</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.790" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">about it mm-hmm it would hurt yep right</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.980" end="00:52:18.980" style="s2">it&#39;s something about myself with this</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:21.710" style="s2">which is sufficiently raw yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.980" end="00:52:25.610" style="s2">sufficiently unprotected sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.710" end="00:52:28.310" style="s2">new to my own consciousness sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.610" end="00:52:32.230" style="s2">new to the process of sharing that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.310" end="00:52:35.600" style="s2">don&#39;t have it&#39;s not tough it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.230" end="00:52:37.160" style="s2">facile yeah so I&#39;m sharing something</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.600" end="00:52:42.080" style="s2">vulnerable I&#39;m sharing something which</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.160" end="00:52:44.000" style="s2">is actually alive for me in myself some</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.080" end="00:52:48.950" style="s2">part of myself and then the second step</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.000" end="00:52:52.070" style="s2">is I feel understood by you yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.950" end="00:52:54.910" style="s2">like you actually get it like you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.070" end="00:52:59.720" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.910" end="00:53:03.640" style="s2">my experience and my articulation gets</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.720" end="00:53:06.590" style="s2">reflected through you such that I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.640" end="00:53:09.620" style="s2">this thing that I&#39;m experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.590" end="00:53:11.390" style="s2">actually lives in our shared reality our</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.620" end="00:53:15.500" style="s2">shared space so I share something</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.390" end="00:53:16.730" style="s2">vulnerable right I feel understood like</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.500" end="00:53:19.970" style="s2">you might understand me but if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.730" end="00:53:23.090" style="s2">feel understood that loop isn&#39;t complete</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.970" end="00:53:25.539" style="s2">yeah so I share something vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.090" end="00:53:33.849" style="s2">I can feel understood and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.539" end="00:53:35.409" style="s2">I feel accepted I feel that you think</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.849" end="00:53:37.809" style="s2">that I&#39;m a good person that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.409" end="00:53:40.239" style="s2">reason for doing it that I&#39;m that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.809" end="00:53:42.789" style="s2">can you can understand and go yeah I get</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.239" end="00:53:44.409" style="s2">it right like you&#39;re a good person so</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.789" end="00:53:45.880" style="s2">when that happens when I share something</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.409" end="00:53:51.119" style="s2">vulnerable I feel understood and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.880" end="00:53:55.959" style="s2">accepted I&#39;m gonna experience intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.119" end="00:53:59.739" style="s2">and there&#39;s two sides to that one I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.959" end="00:54:03.039" style="s2">to have my room clean enough that I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.739" end="00:54:05.709" style="s2">enough self available that I have enough</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.039" end="00:54:08.199" style="s2">consciousness available that I can look</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.709" end="00:54:10.089" style="s2">into myself notice what I&#39;m experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.199" end="00:54:13.630" style="s2">and share it with you and I have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.089" end="00:54:15.309" style="s2">courage I have the courage to share it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.630" end="00:54:18.429" style="s2">with you because I&#39;ve got enough of my</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.309" end="00:54:19.839" style="s2">shit in order that I can risk it you</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.429" end="00:54:21.339" style="s2">have that I have the bandwidth available</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.839" end="00:54:23.619" style="s2">the mental bandwidth the wood available</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.339" end="00:54:26.499" style="s2">the mental emotional bandwidth and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.619" end="00:54:30.039" style="s2">have the courage to share it that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.499" end="00:54:35.169" style="s2">provokes intimacy but then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.039" end="00:54:36.789" style="s2">have your room clean enough that you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.169" end="00:54:39.669" style="s2">actually give me the bandwidth to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.789" end="00:54:41.319" style="s2">understand me and accept me and not just</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.669" end="00:54:43.389" style="s2">get triggered by what I&#39;m saying and go</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.319" end="00:54:45.219" style="s2">into your world right because I mean</p>

<p begin="01:00:34.579" end="01:00:44.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a thing with it is it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.199" end="01:00:46.640" style="s2">it&#39;s crazy like it&#39;s crazy to watch him</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.900" end="01:00:49.959" style="s2">go on an interview where it&#39;s so clean</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.640" end="01:00:53.660" style="s2">Stefan&#39;s like probably probably over Oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.959" end="01:00:55.969" style="s2">at least over eight times that I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.660" end="01:00:58.309" style="s2">aware of where it&#39;s clearly the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.969" end="01:01:00.979" style="s2">interviewer comes in with the position</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.309" end="01:01:02.779" style="s2">and they already have a peg doubt and</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.979" end="01:01:04.849" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to get him or catch him</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.779" end="01:01:09.199" style="s2">in something and what&#39;s been cool so far</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.849" end="01:01:12.349" style="s2">is that the jokes always ended up being</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.199" end="01:01:13.940" style="s2">on the on the interviewer like he</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.349" end="01:01:16.369" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that are made into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.940" end="01:01:19.549" style="s2">fool right so so far I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.369" end="01:01:23.329" style="s2">pretty much what&#39;s happened which it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.549" end="01:01:25.279" style="s2">really cool and I&#39;m not Matt Dillahunty</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.329" end="01:01:27.049" style="s2">perhaps being the sole exception that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.279" end="01:01:29.420" style="s2">know of yeah I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.049" end="01:01:32.599" style="s2">that one yeah and I have something to</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.420" end="01:01:34.009" style="s2">say greatness to and I think it has the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.599" end="01:01:35.539" style="s2">same thing to do with the way the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.009" end="01:01:37.009" style="s2">Petersons showing up in those interviews</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.539" end="01:01:40.549" style="s2">of course there&#39;s a couple of things one</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.009" end="01:01:43.569" style="s2">is I think right it&#39;s like I think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.549" end="01:01:47.479" style="s2">that um I think that that actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.569" end="01:01:53.959" style="s2">truthfully one of the reasons that if</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.479" end="01:01:59.329" style="s2">Peterson wasn&#39;t like dark right and in</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.959" end="01:02:02.719" style="s2">moody right into intense and I like a</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.329" end="01:02:04.999" style="s2">boy who likes to fight cut like it and</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.719" end="01:02:06.529" style="s2">he clearly likes to fight right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.999" end="01:02:08.060" style="s2">like it&#39;s going in there and going like</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.529" end="01:02:10.430" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.060" end="01:02:12.260" style="s2">like how come you&#39;re trying to do this</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.430" end="01:02:13.790" style="s2">with me he&#39;s like you can you could see</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.260" end="01:02:14.360" style="s2">there&#39;s some part of him that&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.790" end="01:02:18.230" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.360" end="01:02:22.460" style="s2">it&#39;s totally him right and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.230" end="01:02:24.320" style="s2">there&#39;s the wet in my what I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.460" end="01:02:27.260" style="s2">with him is that when a nerve you comes</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.320" end="01:02:28.760" style="s2">at him he just holds his position he</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.260" end="01:02:30.920" style="s2">holds his position and he occasionally</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.760" end="01:02:34.580" style="s2">steps out of it for a second and he</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.920" end="01:02:36.710" style="s2">makes a joke about you know well be like</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.580" end="01:02:38.600" style="s2">in the last one that I saw of him with</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.710" end="01:02:40.430" style="s2">the woman that was like kind of nailing</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.600" end="01:02:43.910" style="s2">him about like getting money for what he</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.430" end="01:02:45.500" style="s2">does like you yeah just a bag he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.910" end="01:02:48.770" style="s2">well as the evil capitalist that I am</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.500" end="01:02:51.380" style="s2">right is where he kind of points to</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.770" end="01:02:53.780" style="s2">where they&#39;re coming from but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.380" end="01:02:56.090" style="s2">ever attack them I&#39;ve never seen him</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.780" end="01:02:59.210" style="s2">attack I&#39;ve seen him get frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.090" end="01:03:01.550" style="s2">right I&#39;ve seen him get flustered but</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.210" end="01:03:07.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve always seen him just talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.550" end="01:03:09.740" style="s2">issues and where he stands right however</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.850" end="01:03:11.330" style="s2">I think that there&#39;s something more</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.740" end="01:03:12.740" style="s2">available and I think it was also the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.330" end="01:03:14.270" style="s2">case with Matt Dillahunty</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.740" end="01:03:16.100" style="s2">because I think what he was trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.270" end="01:03:21.260" style="s2">with Matt Dillahunty was something very</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.100" end="01:03:23.360" style="s2">very very difficult to do but also I</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.260" end="01:03:26.300" style="s2">think Dillahunty would have played along</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.360" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">with it right and it could have set the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.300" end="01:03:31.160" style="s2">frames in place like with sam harris</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:32.600" style="s2">like was a paris and truth if he if he</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.160" end="01:03:34.910" style="s2">said look i want to go into a</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.600" end="01:03:36.830" style="s2">non-typical frame i&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.910" end="01:03:38.840" style="s2">this is going to redefine the normal use</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.830" end="01:03:40.910" style="s2">of the words but for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.840" end="01:03:44.210" style="s2">this conversation let&#39;s create a</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.910" end="01:03:47.240" style="s2">hypothetical have gone along that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.210" end="01:03:48.530" style="s2">smart guy totally totally and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.240" end="01:03:50.690" style="s2">part that&#39;s the part about it and i</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.530" end="01:03:52.340" style="s2">remember you saying that about him when</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.690" end="01:03:55.430" style="s2">we were doing the first conversation</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.340" end="01:03:57.140" style="s2">about his he&#39;s like the blotch with</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.430" end="01:03:59.360" style="s2">harrison the first two-hour interview</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.140" end="01:04:01.790" style="s2">about truth where they got stuck were</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.360" end="01:04:04.940" style="s2">you were talking about like yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.790" end="01:04:07.000" style="s2">know what i believe what you would i</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.940" end="01:04:09.920" style="s2">recall you saying is like Jordan wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.000" end="01:04:12.380" style="s2">accounting for how radical of a position</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.920" end="01:04:14.990" style="s2">that he&#39;s coming in with right that if</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.380" end="01:04:16.630" style="s2">he would have said hey like look I want</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.990" end="01:04:18.950" style="s2">to play with this idea with you I</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.630" end="01:04:21.319" style="s2">acknowledge and understand that this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.950" end="01:04:25.699" style="s2">way outside of the normal framework</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.319" end="01:04:26.599" style="s2">right and set that up and then like they</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.699" end="01:04:28.699" style="s2">could have found out where they were</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.599" end="01:04:30.859" style="s2">gone like and I appreciated that</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.699" end="01:04:33.049" style="s2">and they think that there&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.859" end="01:04:35.150" style="s2">something in a slightly different angle</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.049" end="01:04:38.239" style="s2">with the interviewing that our that our</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.150" end="01:04:40.849" style="s2">people are attacking him is I think that</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.239" end="01:04:46.430" style="s2">there&#39;s an opportunity to like call it</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.849" end="01:04:48.890" style="s2">what it is go like pause I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.430" end="01:04:51.259" style="s2">that that&#39;s a question like when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.890" end="01:04:53.660" style="s2">just asked me about about like how much</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.259" end="01:04:55.459" style="s2">money I&#39;m getting my senses that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.660" end="01:04:59.239" style="s2">actually have a position that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.459" end="01:05:03.349" style="s2">trying to catch me in is that true right</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.239" end="01:05:05.599" style="s2">and actually unearth the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.349" end="01:05:07.640" style="s2">actually happening in the room right</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.599" end="01:05:11.119" style="s2">because I have a feeling that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.640" end="01:05:13.339" style="s2">opportunity there that&#39;s if the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.119" end="01:05:16.519" style="s2">interviewer then goes back into that</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.339" end="01:05:19.269" style="s2">position and he goes like I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.519" end="01:05:21.920" style="s2">I still don&#39;t think that you actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.269" end="01:05:23.749" style="s2">relating to me as a person with a</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.920" end="01:05:27.380" style="s2">viewpoint that has a validity that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.749" end="01:05:30.140" style="s2">want to find out what that is like how</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.380" end="01:05:31.759" style="s2">if that&#39;s true how come you&#39;re doing did</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.140" end="01:05:34.009" style="s2">you know you&#39;re doing that like it</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.759" end="01:05:35.660" style="s2">actually get the get the living the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.009" end="01:05:41.299" style="s2">living conversation up</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.660" end="01:05:49.819" style="s2">I would love yes okay so a couple a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.299" end="01:05:52.849" style="s2">couple things with that one I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.819" end="01:05:55.789" style="s2">imagine why why you particularly would</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.849" end="01:05:59.239" style="s2">want him to call attention to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.789" end="01:06:01.430" style="s2">happening including what in an inquiry</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.239" end="01:06:04.549" style="s2">way such as you shift the level of</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.430" end="01:06:06.529" style="s2">conversation to the structure of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.549" end="01:06:09.259" style="s2">conversation and the way of being behind</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.529" end="01:06:11.599" style="s2">the conversation and the motivations not</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.259" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">as an accusation but as an inquiry I</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.599" end="01:06:15.380" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine why you would do that just</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:17.180" style="s2">where I think it&#39;s like where I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.380" end="01:06:18.829" style="s2">it&#39;s actually consistent with where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.180" end="01:06:21.349" style="s2">coming from because what does he do he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.829" end="01:06:22.999" style="s2">not going let&#39;s look what&#39;s beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.349" end="01:06:25.249" style="s2">horizon he&#39;s like let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.999" end="01:06:27.799" style="s2">horizon that gives our understanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.249" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">that we stand on top of and don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.799" end="01:06:30.769" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.160" end="01:06:32.299" style="s2">let&#39;s unearth it and unpack it and see</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.769" end="01:06:33.630" style="s2">and this is the thing where you say he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.299" end="01:06:36.520" style="s2">doing the same thing that heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.630" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">like Heidegger worked so hard and</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.520" end="01:06:41.590" style="s2">created this obtuse vocabulary sorry</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:43.930" style="s2">yeah maybe it&#39;s helpful when you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.590" end="01:06:46.870" style="s2">all the black books and the unpublished</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.930" end="01:06:50.290" style="s2">stuff to matter so much to make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.870" end="01:06:54.850" style="s2">it right but but he&#39;s attempting to</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.290" end="01:06:57.190" style="s2">point out the horizon within which the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.850" end="01:06:59.260" style="s2">self exists and the things that become</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.190" end="01:07:01.360" style="s2">optimal only exist in that optimal</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.260" end="01:07:03.400" style="s2">context and what is the story and how do</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.360" end="01:07:05.110" style="s2">we shift the focus from how do we move</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.400" end="01:07:09.940" style="s2">within the story to what is the story</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.110" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">itself yep and yeah and Peterson is</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.940" end="01:07:14.320" style="s2">doing that on a macro level where he</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:15.430" style="s2">does maps of meaning like I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.320" end="01:07:17.020" style="s2">you it all comes down to this</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.430" end="01:07:19.150" style="s2">fundamental story and I want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.020" end="01:07:22.420" style="s2">about the story that we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.150" end="01:07:24.670" style="s2">within so we can figure out how the all</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.420" end="01:07:28.410" style="s2">of the wisdom of the past can help us</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.670" end="01:07:30.970" style="s2">navigate this fundamental story which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.410" end="01:07:34.150" style="s2">part of the technology of being human</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.970" end="01:07:37.510" style="s2">like we wake up in a body with the brain</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.150" end="01:07:40.030" style="s2">that has must move and live and eat and</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.510" end="01:07:41.830" style="s2">interact that&#39;s the technology and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.030" end="01:07:44.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a technician within that</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.830" end="01:07:44.650" style="s2">technology which is this fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.020" end="01:07:48.370" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.650" end="01:07:49.810" style="s2">yep total and I want to go from not from</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.370" end="01:07:53.830" style="s2">within the story but let&#39;s actually look</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.810" end="01:07:56.440" style="s2">at the storytelling let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.830" end="01:07:59.770" style="s2">story what is the horizon in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.440" end="01:08:02.520" style="s2">working so we come we come into he comes</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.770" end="01:08:06.130" style="s2">into an an interview with Joe Rogan and</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.520" end="01:08:09.220" style="s2">Joe Rogan says so what&#39;s your trip and</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.130" end="01:08:10.960" style="s2">the buter Singh goes boom boom and Rogan</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.220" end="01:08:13.240" style="s2">goes really Wow what about this what</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.960" end="01:08:16.390" style="s2">about and it just unfolds and it grows</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.240" end="01:08:20.230" style="s2">because the technology that Joe Rogan is</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.390" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">using leus to an openness for peterson</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.230" end="01:08:27.130" style="s2">to shine exactly so they just give his</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:30.850" style="s2">gifts and shine but what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.130" end="01:08:32.440" style="s2">is it&#39;s not it&#39;s not not and this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.850" end="01:08:34.990" style="s2">what makes it untechnical a lot like</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.440" end="01:08:37.480" style="s2">what what tech technology allow for</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.990" end="01:08:41.140" style="s2">something for something very uncool out</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.480" end="01:08:43.780" style="s2">techni city oriented to happen is it</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.140" end="01:08:47.319" style="s2">what&#39;s shown in Peter soon is people are</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.780" end="01:08:50.890" style="s2">like who is this they&#39;re not like</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.319" end="01:08:54.430" style="s2">in formed as a series of facts they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.890" end="01:08:55.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s an intimate experience of</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.430" end="01:08:59.020" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.960" end="01:09:01.390" style="s2">saying that is not I can&#39;t totally grasp</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.020" end="01:09:05.799" style="s2">but I understand in some way and then I</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.390" end="01:09:08.380" style="s2">don&#39;t understand but the unknown part of</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.799" end="01:09:12.549" style="s2">that actually shines out as the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.380" end="01:09:14.680" style="s2">like chaos right that&#39;s okay yeah so if</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.549" end="01:09:19.510" style="s2">we say that the Tecna city of network</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.680" end="01:09:22.720" style="s2">television yeah leads to a methodology</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.510" end="01:09:25.089" style="s2">of sound bites and those sound bites are</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.720" end="01:09:27.339" style="s2">packaged within the in framing of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.089" end="01:09:30.790" style="s2">Tecna city from the technology right</p>

<p begin="01:09:30.790" end="01:09:41.440" style="s2">Peterson his initial technology is</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.160" end="01:09:45.850" style="s2">recordings of his lectures which are</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.440" end="01:09:48.910" style="s2">open organic they&#39;re not sound bites</p>

<p begin="01:09:48.910" end="01:09:53.020" style="s2">knowledge which you are going to learn</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.650" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">and then regurgitate at the appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.020" end="01:09:58.540" style="s2">time he&#39;s not giving you a tool that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.320" end="01:10:00.220" style="s2">that has a very specific use that at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.540" end="01:10:04.230" style="s2">appropriate time you bring out that tool</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.220" end="01:10:10.650" style="s2">and you use it he&#39;s not giving you a</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.230" end="01:10:14.890" style="s2">world yeah he&#39;s giving you world</p>

<p begin="01:10:14.890" end="01:10:20.380" style="s2">you world here&#39;s how you create the</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.860" end="01:10:23.440" style="s2">stories let&#39;s get into the technology of</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.380" end="01:10:26.020" style="s2">how you actually create stories and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.440" end="01:10:28.210" style="s2">and let&#39;s have you like here check out</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.020" end="01:10:30.970" style="s2">this brilliant person and here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.210" end="01:10:33.220" style="s2">they thought about notice what that</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.970" end="01:10:35.200" style="s2">makes possible for you beyond what you</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.220" end="01:10:38.920" style="s2">already know yeah let me give you a</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.200" end="01:10:41.320" style="s2">method a methodology for world addala G</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.920" end="01:10:43.900" style="s2">for creating stories I&#39;m going to give</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.320" end="01:10:48.330" style="s2">you a best practice yeah and the best</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.900" end="01:10:53.530" style="s2">practice is right that you have a goal</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.330" end="01:10:57.430" style="s2">and the goal creates the facts yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.530" end="01:10:59.790" style="s2">facts do not create the goal yes and if</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.430" end="01:11:02.820" style="s2">you will clean your room</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.790" end="01:11:06.670" style="s2">then you free up your consciousness to</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.820" end="01:11:09.100" style="s2">actually discover a goal that is yours</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.670" end="01:11:12.850" style="s2">not the goal that you inherit from the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.100" end="01:11:16.360" style="s2">world yeah like it&#39;s not that the goal</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.850" end="01:11:18.390" style="s2">of being in Plano Texas is which chain</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.360" end="01:11:21.970" style="s2">restaurant are we going to go to tonight</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.390" end="01:11:24.100" style="s2">not optimizing in making something and</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.970" end="01:11:26.110" style="s2">me like collapsing distances which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.100" end="01:11:28.450" style="s2">that what technology does is it collapse</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.110" end="01:11:30.070" style="s2">distances but it makes something further</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.450" end="01:11:31.960" style="s2">away right</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.070" end="01:11:35.440" style="s2">the thing about what&#39;s extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.960" end="01:11:38.200" style="s2">about Petersen is like I think I was I</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.440" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">was uh I&#39;ve heard a bunch of people talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.200" end="01:11:43.690" style="s2">about Petersen movies like look I like</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:45.100" style="s2">his point he he&#39;s not clear on these</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.690" end="01:11:45.670" style="s2">things I don&#39;t know where he stands on</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.100" end="01:11:49.330" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.670" end="01:11:51.630" style="s2">bum bum bum bum buh buh and they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.330" end="01:11:54.550" style="s2">of criticizing him for that and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.630" end="01:11:58.750" style="s2">to me that&#39;s not a criticism in fact in</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.550" end="01:12:01.690" style="s2">fact that you can&#39;t pin him down and he</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.750" end="01:12:03.430" style="s2">can&#39;t pin him down right like he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.690" end="01:12:05.830" style="s2">fucking have a position on it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.430" end="01:12:07.660" style="s2">easily as he talked about like well if</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.830" end="01:12:10.810" style="s2">you want to know what I do I believe in</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.660" end="01:12:12.460" style="s2">God I&#39;d sit and watch those lectures</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.810" end="01:12:14.290" style="s2">that&#39;s what how long it takes for me to</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.460" end="01:12:16.540" style="s2">kind of work that out and I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.290" end="01:12:21.400" style="s2">working it out as I&#39;m talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.540" end="01:12:23.590" style="s2">right like that people can see that and</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.400" end="01:12:25.900" style="s2">they&#39;re gripped by it is because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.590" end="01:12:27.310" style="s2">something real there like and I think I</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.900" end="01:12:30.910" style="s2">loved how you put that he&#39;s like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.310" end="01:12:33.460" style="s2">not presenting a world right like an app</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.910" end="01:12:35.860" style="s2">that you opened that presupposes you in</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.460" end="01:12:36.490" style="s2">it and that you like lose lose yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.860" end="01:12:39.480" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.490" end="01:12:44.290" style="s2">no he&#39;s what I heard you say is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.480" end="01:12:46.720" style="s2">he&#39;s giving world ding he&#39;s engaging you</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.290" end="01:12:51.990" style="s2">in something that isn&#39;t fully complete</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.720" end="01:12:55.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s incompleteness the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.990" end="01:12:57.430" style="s2">speaks to a horizon that can&#39;t be fully</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.000" end="01:12:59.860" style="s2">revealed right it&#39;s like in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.430" end="01:13:01.030" style="s2">it&#39;s theological it&#39;s like religious and</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.860" end="01:13:04.410" style="s2">that I think that&#39;s what he means by</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.030" end="01:13:09.460" style="s2">religious right is that live your life</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.410" end="01:13:12.730" style="s2">in such a way that the farthest horizon</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.460" end="01:13:16.030" style="s2">is what shines to you right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.730" end="01:13:20.470" style="s2">chaos that shows up to you is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.030" end="01:13:23.860" style="s2">that you can&#39;t and then watch and like</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.470" end="01:13:26.440" style="s2">in that engagement will is the is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.860" end="01:13:30.730" style="s2">articulation of your character right it</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.440" end="01:13:32.710" style="s2">is the making of your face right but</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.730" end="01:13:35.350" style="s2">live in a way that like presence is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.710" end="01:13:38.140" style="s2">horizon that gives testimony back to her</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.350" end="01:13:40.660" style="s2">that horizon that makes you a veil to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.140" end="01:13:43.780" style="s2">yourself that actually is available to</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.660" end="01:13:46.960" style="s2">be gripped by what isn&#39;t immediately</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.780" end="01:13:48.460" style="s2">intelligible to you but it&#39;s Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.960" end="01:13:52.600" style="s2">would say like follow the movement is</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.460" end="01:13:59.950" style="s2">showing right and that&#39;s what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.600" end="01:14:03.130" style="s2">being speaks in saying that I I got a</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.950" end="01:14:04.900" style="s2">new metaphor which I&#39;m looking forward</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.130" end="01:14:06.430" style="s2">to how it unfolds I&#39;m looking forward to</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.900" end="01:14:09.400" style="s2">how it integrates into what I&#39;m doing I</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.430" end="01:14:18.820" style="s2">want to give it to you so so when I</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.400" end="01:14:25.170" style="s2">think about a horizon a horizon is</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.820" end="01:14:27.790" style="s2">relative to where you are yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.170" end="01:14:30.460" style="s2">what I&#39;m what I got from what you were</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.790" end="01:14:33.330" style="s2">saying is that Peterson is saying that</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.460" end="01:14:36.100" style="s2">there is a horizon beyond your horizon</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.330" end="01:14:41.020" style="s2">but there is a horizon that happens when</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.100" end="01:14:44.410" style="s2">you are moving yep yeah and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.020" end="01:14:46.540" style="s2">greater horizon which is only you can</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.410" end="01:14:49.320" style="s2">only imagine it because it&#39;s beyond your</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.540" end="01:14:52.030" style="s2">horizon and you can&#39;t even imagine it</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.320" end="01:14:54.690" style="s2">because it&#39;s beyond your horizon it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.030" end="01:14:58.630" style="s2">beyond the horizon of your imagination</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.690" end="01:15:03.730" style="s2">yep and it&#39;s that greater horizon that</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.630" end="01:15:06.220" style="s2">you orient toward us yes yes into the</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.730" end="01:15:08.530" style="s2">degree that you don&#39;t to the degree that</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.220" end="01:15:13.570" style="s2">that becomes something that like you</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.530" end="01:15:16.570" style="s2">actually go bad or no or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.570" end="01:15:18.370" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have you because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.570" end="01:15:21.010" style="s2">other thing about a horizon is that like</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.370" end="01:15:23.560" style="s2">when you go towards it you can&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.010" end="01:15:25.630" style="s2">reach it so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s this bizarre</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.560" end="01:15:26.410" style="s2">like it man you can think about horizons</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.630" end="01:15:30.280" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.410" end="01:15:32.890" style="s2">years right like as when you go to its</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.280" end="01:15:36.790" style="s2">its on some level it&#39;s an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.890" end="01:15:39.070" style="s2">limitation it gives the ground it gives</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.790" end="01:15:42.490" style="s2">the most certain thing that you can know</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.070" end="01:15:44.080" style="s2">about your ground but it&#39;s what gives it</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.490" end="01:15:49.120" style="s2">is something that can&#39;t ever be reached</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.080" end="01:15:53.430" style="s2">in that that horizon ground experience I</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.120" end="01:15:53.430" style="s2">think what what Peterson is</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.550" end="01:15:57.070" style="s2">demonstrating and I think what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.480" end="01:16:00.880" style="s2">articulating and I think what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.070" end="01:16:04.440" style="s2">pointing to what Western Western</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.880" end="01:16:06.400" style="s2">religion and judeo christianism is is</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.440" end="01:16:10.300" style="s2">articulating is like look it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.400" end="01:16:12.700" style="s2">relationship to that horizon needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.300" end="01:16:16.110" style="s2">one it&#39;s it&#39;s just gonna work out better</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.700" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">if you move toward it like you actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.110" end="01:16:24.850" style="s2">you actually like don&#39;t go stop and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:27.880" style="s2">and get bitter and resentful for the</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.850" end="01:16:30.340" style="s2">limitation but you like you you let them</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.880" end="01:16:33.580" style="s2">like the thing that can&#39;t be spoken or</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.340" end="01:16:37.240" style="s2">seen and you orient everything towards</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.580" end="01:16:39.790" style="s2">it and you move toward it right but but</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.240" end="01:16:41.860" style="s2">in such a way you know that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.790" end="01:16:44.110" style="s2">is because in order to move towards it</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.860" end="01:16:46.930" style="s2">it requires you to get your shit</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.110" end="01:16:49.630" style="s2">together right and the more you get your</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.930" end="01:16:51.850" style="s2">shit together the more you can move</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.630" end="01:16:54.100" style="s2">towards the horizon and therefore expand</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.850" end="01:16:55.780" style="s2">it and find new horizons and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.100" end="01:17:00.900" style="s2">what you&#39;re focusing on is the horizon</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.780" end="01:17:04.870" style="s2">of horizons yeah right the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.900" end="01:17:06.880" style="s2">abstract mmm-hmm you know integration of</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.870" end="01:17:10.600" style="s2">the horizons that you&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.880" end="01:17:12.910" style="s2">yeah so- throughout the allergy and you</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.600" end="01:17:15.270" style="s2">know i&#39;m fond of the phrase where you</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.910" end="01:17:17.410" style="s2">say you know if you have a quarter</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.270" end="01:17:20.680" style="s2">there&#39;s only so many things that you can</p>

<p begin="01:22:57.139" end="01:23:06.519" style="s2">move call it just a king of the logical</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.309" end="01:23:11.030" style="s2">level yep in this typical interview mode</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.519" end="01:23:14.570" style="s2">you are focused on me yeah you are</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.030" end="01:23:18.530" style="s2">setting frames within which I answer yes</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.570" end="01:23:21.559" style="s2">yes I&#39;m going to switch the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.530" end="01:23:25.190" style="s2">this game yeah and make it about how</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.559" end="01:23:28.400" style="s2">we&#39;re conversing right right right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.190" end="01:23:31.820" style="s2">going to include you in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.400" end="01:23:33.530" style="s2">not just your questions but you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.820" end="01:23:36.260" style="s2">right and when he did that with Kathy</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.530" end="01:23:39.670" style="s2">Newman that&#39;s exactly that was the key</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.260" end="01:23:42.409" style="s2">he he shifted the conversation from</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.670" end="01:23:44.989" style="s2">answering her questions to drawing</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.409" end="01:23:47.150" style="s2">attention to the then the dynamic in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.989" end="01:23:48.499" style="s2">room to the actual conversation the</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.150" end="01:23:49.909" style="s2">thing that was happening the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.499" end="01:23:51.829" style="s2">people are actually they&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.909" end="01:23:54.829" style="s2">but that wasn&#39;t the focus of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.829" end="01:23:56.719" style="s2">conversation in postmodern terms right</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.829" end="01:23:58.610" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a dominant narrative and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.719" end="01:24:00.079" style="s2">dominant narrative is we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.610" end="01:24:02.239" style="s2">context where I&#39;m asking you questions</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.079" end="01:24:03.619" style="s2">your job is to defend yourself and it</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.239" end="01:24:08.389" style="s2">becomes clear after</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.619" end="01:24:10.849" style="s2">for 5-10 minutes 15 seconds that this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.389" end="01:24:12.229" style="s2">not a Joe Rogan conversation this is not</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.849" end="01:24:13.639" style="s2">a Dave Rubin conversation where</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.229" end="01:24:16.610" style="s2">someone&#39;s actually asking you a question</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.639" end="01:24:18.829" style="s2">and you are actually sharing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.610" end="01:24:21.559" style="s2">with their intention to understand and</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.829" end="01:24:22.999" style="s2">be understood and be accepted that is</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.559" end="01:24:26.749" style="s2">not the game it is not a game of</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.999" end="01:24:29.659" style="s2">intimacy yeah this is a game of gotcha</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.749" end="01:24:32.149" style="s2">yeah this is a game of you fit into the</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.659" end="01:24:33.530" style="s2">box and I have succeeded in putting you</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.149" end="01:24:36.860" style="s2">in the box that I want you in because</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.530" end="01:24:38.300" style="s2">that serves my agenda so it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.860" end="01:24:41.119" style="s2">obvious at some point that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.300" end="01:24:43.159" style="s2">game yeah everybody sees it but the</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.119" end="01:24:46.369" style="s2">dominant narrative is that that game is</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.159" end="01:24:48.439" style="s2">concealed we are not talking about that</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.369" end="01:24:50.719" style="s2">game there&#39;s the world and here all the</p>

<p begin="01:30:19.790" end="01:30:28.820" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna budge and that&#39;s the place</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.070" end="01:30:31.639" style="s2">where I&#39;m kind of I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m hoping cuz</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.820" end="01:30:36.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which I experience Sam</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.639" end="01:30:38.480" style="s2">Harris is like there&#39;s there&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.199" end="01:30:40.610" style="s2">where he&#39;s like he&#39;s true to the what</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.480" end="01:30:42.530" style="s2">we&#39;re talking the dark web and that in</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.610" end="01:30:44.780" style="s2">that place of like we&#39;re gonna engage in</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.530" end="01:30:47.210" style="s2">a conversation and work we&#39;re engaging</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.780" end="01:30:49.550" style="s2">it not to be right and to reaffirm</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.210" end="01:30:54.020" style="s2">ourselves right but we&#39;re engaging into</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.550" end="01:30:57.139" style="s2">it with the explicit risk of being our</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.020" end="01:30:59.570" style="s2">world changing after the two of you you</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.139" end="01:31:02.570" style="s2">and I interact like the job isn&#39;t to win</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.570" end="01:31:07.400" style="s2">the debate that his job is to reveal the</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.570" end="01:31:09.080" style="s2">truth right Hey and so I give this sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.400" end="01:31:13.190" style="s2">with religion that there&#39;s some there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.080" end="01:31:16.880" style="s2">something because I think as year is you</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.190" end="01:31:20.570" style="s2">really pointed out with with with with</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.880" end="01:31:22.790" style="s2">Jordan Peterson he&#39;s not at all talking</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.570" end="01:31:25.250" style="s2">about religion in the normal American</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.790" end="01:31:27.530" style="s2">way that most people think about</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.250" end="01:31:31.130" style="s2">religion which is a really like like a a</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.530" end="01:31:33.889" style="s2">very shallow like view of it which is</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.130" end="01:31:35.599" style="s2">there was this guy named Jesus Christ</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.889" end="01:31:37.040" style="s2">who actually lived and they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.599" end="01:31:39.469" style="s2">tried to get they look at as an</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.040" end="01:31:42.760" style="s2">empirical truth which is a which is</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.469" end="01:31:45.110" style="s2">ridiculous right on in that level</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.760" end="01:31:47.929" style="s2">Peterson saying that&#39;s not the truth</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.110" end="01:31:50.449" style="s2">that&#39;s revealed in that you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.929" end="01:31:53.179" style="s2">not reading the length the depth of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.449" end="01:31:56.060" style="s2">language has this history that goes way</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.179" end="01:31:59.290" style="s2">way way back and it&#39;s the axioms that</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.060" end="01:32:02.659" style="s2">you that even Sam Harris is standing on</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.290" end="01:32:04.429" style="s2">that&#39;s arguing that point for going</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.659" end="01:32:07.340" style="s2">against that point is given by the</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.429" end="01:32:10.099" style="s2">axioms of judeo christianism right and</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.340" end="01:32:13.400" style="s2">so so there&#39;s a level of depth and</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.099" end="01:32:16.280" style="s2">complexity that I think Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.400" end="01:32:20.810" style="s2">is trying to bring up with him I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.280" end="01:32:23.119" style="s2">know if sam Harris is up to be II I</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.810" end="01:32:25.909" style="s2">don&#39;t know if he&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.119" end="01:32:28.639" style="s2">to letting to letting himself change</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.909" end="01:32:29.269" style="s2">that view what what are your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.639" end="01:32:33.800" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.269" end="01:32:34.340" style="s2">I just don&#39;t I can&#39;t see it so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.800" end="01:32:37.070" style="s2">what I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.340" end="01:32:39.110" style="s2">unless Jordan becomes more flexible in</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.070" end="01:32:44.209" style="s2">creating the frames in which to have the</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.110" end="01:32:48.739" style="s2">conversation yep yep right yeah he has</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.209" end="01:32:51.729" style="s2">his much chance of getting Sam Harris to</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.739" end="01:32:56.749" style="s2">budge from that point yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.729" end="01:32:59.389" style="s2">as Michael Eric Dyson has of getting him</p>

<p begin="01:32:59.389" end="01:33:06.729" style="s2">privilege that that so let me let me</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.969" end="01:33:08.079" style="s2">turn Peterson on himself for a moment</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.729" end="01:33:11.449" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.079" end="01:33:16.939" style="s2">you could say that he&#39;s got this entire</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.449" end="01:33:18.590" style="s2">framework of myth this hero&#39;s journey if</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.939" end="01:33:21.439" style="s2">he has brought into the maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.590" end="01:33:26.809" style="s2">and he lays out maps meaning is a really</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.439" end="01:33:28.340" style="s2">good book very difficult ambitious but</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.809" end="01:33:29.599" style="s2">but when it really comes down to it he</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.340" end="01:33:31.629" style="s2">does a pretty good job of simplifying</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.599" end="01:33:34.519" style="s2">its model down into its essence</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.629" end="01:33:38.079" style="s2">fundamental story of of order and chaos</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.519" end="01:33:40.840" style="s2">and tyranny in in in danger but also</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.079" end="01:33:43.249" style="s2">strength and opportunity and the arrow</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.840" end="01:33:49.090" style="s2">articulates that through speech and</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.249" end="01:33:51.699" style="s2">action yeah okay so great great story</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.090" end="01:33:57.340" style="s2">now he&#39;s got this thing about</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.699" end="01:34:01.639" style="s2">totalitarianism and gulags and</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.340" end="01:34:07.489" style="s2">concentration camps and identity</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.639" end="01:34:13.129" style="s2">politics yeah yeah now there is a sense</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.489" end="01:34:14.840" style="s2">in which these are deeply connected to</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.129" end="01:34:19.579" style="s2">the degree that you play identity</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.840" end="01:34:23.119" style="s2">politics you you&#39;re on the side of</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.579" end="01:34:26.419" style="s2">tyranny in this model yeah right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.119" end="01:34:29.659" style="s2">are par excellence putting people into</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.419" end="01:34:31.999" style="s2">boxes and treating them as objects yes</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.659" end="01:34:34.639" style="s2">rather than treating them as subjects</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.999" end="01:34:36.940" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re treating them as members of</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.639" end="01:34:42.880" style="s2">a group rather than into</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.940" end="01:34:45.940" style="s2">yes and the sequin the sine qua non of</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.880" end="01:34:48.800" style="s2">Western civilization as he puts it like</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.940" end="01:34:52.820" style="s2">okay you can argue as this western or</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.800" end="01:34:54.679" style="s2">whatever is it judeo-christian like he</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.820" end="01:34:57.800" style="s2">says that this is built into the Marduk</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.679" end="01:35:01.690" style="s2">myth yeah oh yeah okay well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.800" end="01:35:04.400" style="s2">that&#39;s not judeo-christian well yet yet</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.690" end="01:35:06.800" style="s2">right yes we were born in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.400" end="01:35:08.389" style="s2">judeo-christian thing in the same way</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.800" end="01:35:10.369" style="s2">that were born into a Marduk thing right</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.389" end="01:35:12.979" style="s2">we&#39;re built were born into this heroic</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.369" end="01:35:19.219" style="s2">myth as articulated by judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.979" end="01:35:22.010" style="s2">somewhat to a degree but at the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.219" end="01:35:25.400" style="s2">of it the thing that he feels is the</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.010" end="01:35:28.130" style="s2">defining feature of Western culture is</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.400" end="01:35:33.139" style="s2">the recognition that the individual is</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.130" end="01:35:36.860" style="s2">the unit of agency and that it is</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.139" end="01:35:42.170" style="s2">respect of the individual right in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.860" end="01:35:46.459" style="s2">in the classic MLK you know the contents</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.170" end="01:35:49.940" style="s2">of your character yeah yeah have you</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.459" end="01:35:52.880" style="s2">cleaned your room yep what do you bring</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.940" end="01:35:55.429" style="s2">to the party when you&#39;re when the family</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.880" end="01:35:58.190" style="s2">when there&#39;s a death in the family how</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.429" end="01:36:00.139" style="s2">do you show up for the family like what</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.190" end="01:36:03.199" style="s2">do you bring because of who you have</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.139" end="01:36:08.300" style="s2">built yourself to be what is your</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.199" end="01:36:13.070" style="s2">character what is the fundamental unit</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.300" end="01:36:19.489" style="s2">of civilization and he&#39;s not willing to</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.070" end="01:36:22.309" style="s2">budge right okay Sam Harris is saying</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.489" end="01:36:25.869" style="s2">look we have learned to differentiate</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.309" end="01:36:28.840" style="s2">through the scientific method which is</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.869" end="01:36:30.829" style="s2">reproducible yeah through science</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.840" end="01:36:33.679" style="s2">endeavors things we&#39;ve got the three</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.829" end="01:36:36.199" style="s2">strands of valid knowledge right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.679" end="01:36:39.499" style="s2">got the injunction a set of instructions</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.199" end="01:36:40.999" style="s2">for an experiment first strand second</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.499" end="01:36:43.780" style="s2">strand you actually have to perform the</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.999" end="01:36:47.479" style="s2">injunction you have to do the experiment</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.780" end="01:36:48.210" style="s2">Hey in order to test what the experiment</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.479" end="01:36:51.180" style="s2">tests</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.210" end="01:36:52.710" style="s2">and rates you have done the experiment</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.180" end="01:36:56.760" style="s2">you are now part of what he calls the</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.710" end="01:36:59.640" style="s2">community of the adequate right right</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.760" end="01:37:01.740" style="s2">right and that is you talk to other</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.640" end="01:37:03.480" style="s2">people who have done the experiment and</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.740" end="01:37:05.700" style="s2">you check your results against one</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.480" end="01:37:09.060" style="s2">another and he simplifies the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.700" end="01:37:14.970" style="s2">method down into this process right and</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.060" end="01:37:18.900" style="s2">sam harris is saying look story and myth</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.970" end="01:37:20.610" style="s2">can must be interpreted and there are</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.900" end="01:37:23.220" style="s2">lots of stories and lots of myths how</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.610" end="01:37:28.950" style="s2">come you choose those yeah yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.220" end="01:37:31.280" style="s2">choose those myths or yeah yeah then you</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.950" end="01:37:33.690" style="s2">choose to interpret this as</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.280" end="01:37:35.640" style="s2">masculine-feminine yeah and you say that</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.690" end="01:37:38.310" style="s2">it&#39;s in the myth but that&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.640" end="01:37:41.610" style="s2">lot of interpretation going on right and</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.310" end="01:37:44.220" style="s2">that way of thinking well the way of</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.610" end="01:37:47.610" style="s2">thinking which says that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.220" end="01:37:50.970" style="s2">really know something as fact and as</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.610" end="01:37:54.570" style="s2">truth that it&#39;s the goal you take that</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.970" end="01:37:57.030" style="s2">determines what is truth yeah yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.570" end="01:37:58.710" style="s2">like like I say if you know if you look</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.030" end="01:38:01.140" style="s2">around the room you notice what you</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.710" end="01:38:05.100" style="s2">notice well but if you look around it as</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.140" end="01:38:06.630" style="s2">an interior decorator you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.100" end="01:38:08.720" style="s2">going to notice different things if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.630" end="01:38:10.770" style="s2">look around the room as an architect</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.720" end="01:38:14.010" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna notice different things</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.770" end="01:38:16.230" style="s2">around the things that exist for you are</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.010" end="01:38:21.270" style="s2">a function of your story of your context</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.230" end="01:38:24.930" style="s2">of your goal yep okay so goals create</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.270" end="01:38:27.930" style="s2">facts and this you could say this is</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.930" end="01:38:30.780" style="s2">Jordans fundamental from yep what is</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.930" end="01:38:32.400" style="s2">like there&#39;s a chunk of goals and goals</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.780" end="01:38:34.800" style="s2">creat facts and you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.400" end="01:38:38.360" style="s2">metaphysics without a goal and that you</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.800" end="01:38:40.800" style="s2">can&#39;t choose your goal like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.360" end="01:38:49.890" style="s2">like says Oh Ganesha was wrong about</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.800" end="01:38:52.890" style="s2">that that is that is an assertion which</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.890" end="01:38:55.020" style="s2">requires an argument yes he&#39;s made some</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.890" end="01:38:58.140" style="s2">good arguments towards that effect yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.020" end="01:39:01.170" style="s2">right as Iran would say like reality is</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.140" end="01:39:03.900" style="s2">existence is it has a nature it is</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.170" end="01:39:06.540" style="s2">is what it is it has an identity right</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.900" end="01:39:08.670" style="s2">human beings have an identity we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.540" end="01:39:12.929" style="s2">get to choose our ultimate goals we want</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.670" end="01:39:16.350" style="s2">life we want health we want beauty we</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.929" end="01:39:19.290" style="s2">want intimacy these are built-in we can</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.350" end="01:39:21.030" style="s2">attribute those to a god or not we</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.290" end="01:39:24.480" style="s2">certainly have been built up in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.030" end="01:39:29.310" style="s2">stories of that he&#39;s unwilling to budge</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.480" end="01:39:32.429" style="s2">on the story of the individual hero sam</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.310" end="01:39:35.400" style="s2">harris is unwilling to budge on the</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.429" end="01:39:39.600" style="s2">distinct nature of science and what it</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.400" end="01:39:42.570" style="s2">means to build our stories on science or</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.600" end="01:39:46.890" style="s2">not to build them on science both are</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.570" end="01:39:49.949" style="s2">fixed unwilling to budge unless they can</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.890" end="01:39:52.530" style="s2">create unless they can co-create yeah a</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.949" end="01:39:53.910" style="s2">frame that recognizes both of the places</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.530" end="01:39:56.070" style="s2">with they&#39;re unwilling to budge give</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.910" end="01:40:00.030" style="s2">both of them value and then play with</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.070" end="01:40:02.510" style="s2">them right right play with them so Sam</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.030" end="01:40:05.219" style="s2">why is it so important to you</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.510" end="01:40:07.920" style="s2">Jordan why is it so important to you</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.219" end="01:40:09.300" style="s2">let&#39;s actually find out the value</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.920" end="01:40:11.640" style="s2">underneath Sam you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.300" end="01:40:15.750" style="s2">incredible intellect rather than arguing</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.640" end="01:40:18.300" style="s2">with him about terms argue with him</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.750" end="01:40:22.260" style="s2">about why it&#39;s important yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.300" end="01:40:24.780" style="s2">you might find that in the end Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.260" end="01:40:29.520" style="s2">backs out of his central conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.780" end="01:40:35.040" style="s2">because whenever he&#39;s really pressed one</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.520" end="01:40:36.440" style="s2">says there&#39;s a peeing game yeah what is</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.040" end="01:40:41.489" style="s2">the P shedding game</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.440" end="01:40:44.250" style="s2">science empirical data yeah he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.489" end="01:40:46.250" style="s2">there is no secular morality there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.250" end="01:40:49.350" style="s2">this thing called a pee jetting game</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.250" end="01:40:52.410" style="s2">like what the peeing game is secular</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.350" end="01:40:54.780" style="s2">morality that&#39;s what it is you can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.410" end="01:40:57.480" style="s2">that argument and say that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.780" end="01:40:58.500" style="s2">have a secular morality right right</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.480" end="01:41:01.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.500" end="01:41:05.179" style="s2">totally like now sam harris challenged</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.560" end="01:41:08.100" style="s2">him on that ask him how a pata game is</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.179" end="01:41:11.900" style="s2">different than a secular morality yeah</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.100" end="01:41:15.560" style="s2">yes yeah answer like ask</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.900" end="01:41:20.210" style="s2">the questions to get Jordan to actually</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.560" end="01:41:23.570" style="s2">are 10 B no one challenges him down to</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.210" end="01:41:25.400" style="s2">the core yeah yeah and yeah might when</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.570" end="01:41:27.199" style="s2">when you ask him that question he might</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.400" end="01:41:29.179" style="s2">have a good answer I haven&#39;t heard it</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.199" end="01:41:31.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve been wanting someone to ask him</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.179" end="01:41:33.469" style="s2">that question what what&#39;s the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.280" end="01:41:35.780" style="s2">question again like if your dad okay so</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.469" end="01:41:38.300" style="s2">a PA jetting game as Jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.780" end="01:41:43.130" style="s2">says it is okay so if two kids are</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.300" end="01:41:44.989" style="s2">playing right you can win the game but</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.130" end="01:41:47.659" style="s2">if you win the game in a way that no</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.989" end="01:41:51.290" style="s2">one&#39;s willing to play with you yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.659" end="01:41:53.090" style="s2">the future then you lose all of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.290" end="01:41:57.320" style="s2">benefits of playing all the future games</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.090" end="01:41:57.980" style="s2">yeah so the strategy of winning at any</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.320" end="01:42:01.460" style="s2">cost</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.980" end="01:42:04.909" style="s2">yeah is a winning strategy in that game</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.460" end="01:42:08.900" style="s2">but you lose the entire iterated set of</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.909" end="01:42:12.679" style="s2">games with that person yeah right so</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.900" end="01:42:15.199" style="s2">it&#39;s win the battle lose the war so you</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.679" end="01:42:16.400" style="s2">have to come up with the solution you</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.199" end="01:42:19.790" style="s2">have to come up with the strategy that</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.400" end="01:42:23.810" style="s2">not only has you win the game but has</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.790" end="01:42:25.219" style="s2">you lose sometimes yeah so the peple</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.810" end="01:42:27.050" style="s2">will keep playing with you so that you</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.219" end="01:42:29.840" style="s2">can get more than the value of winning</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.050" end="01:42:31.489" style="s2">the game and this is this is like if we</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.840" end="01:42:33.440" style="s2">look at finite and infinite games by</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.489" end="01:42:35.239" style="s2">James cars&#39; right a finite game is</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.440" end="01:42:37.400" style="s2">played so you get the title of winner an</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.239" end="01:42:40.760" style="s2">infinite game is played so that you get</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.400" end="01:42:44.390" style="s2">the joy of the continued play so raises</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.760" end="01:42:46.699" style="s2">the PSAT and game in Carson terms yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.390" end="01:42:48.590" style="s2">right you have to play the game so that</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.699" end="01:42:50.030" style="s2">people will continue to play with you</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.590" end="01:42:54.560" style="s2">yeah totally</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.030" end="01:42:55.880" style="s2">well then it&#39;s not just that person you</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.560" end="01:42:57.320" style="s2">have to play a game that allows you to</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.880" end="01:42:59.120" style="s2">play with all kinds of people because</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.320" end="01:43:01.070" style="s2">each each game that you can play with</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.120" end="01:43:04.070" style="s2">each of those people offers you value</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.070" end="01:43:05.989" style="s2">right right totally and so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.070" end="01:43:09.980" style="s2">play a game that actually creates a</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.989" end="01:43:11.270" style="s2">social context yeah in which you can</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.980" end="01:43:13.900" style="s2">play more games and if you play games</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.270" end="01:43:18.080" style="s2">that make the social context stronger</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.900" end="01:43:22.070" style="s2">yeah through time now you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.080" end="01:43:24.340" style="s2">pia jetty in game right a Pia jetty in</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.070" end="01:43:24.340" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.349" end="01:43:30.320" style="s2">acts as a selection pressure for the</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.590" end="01:43:32.510" style="s2">dominance hierarchy which gets built</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.320" end="01:43:34.670" style="s2">into the ultimate player of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.510" end="01:43:37.520" style="s2">dominance hierarchy namely Jesus in his</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.670" end="01:43:39.500" style="s2">and his understanding like Jesus is the</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.520" end="01:43:42.320" style="s2">ultimate player of the dominance</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.500" end="01:43:45.320" style="s2">hierarchy he is the hero or an one of</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.320" end="01:43:48.139" style="s2">the ultimate heroes and he is a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.320" end="01:43:50.780" style="s2">cool hero like okay if you play like</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.139" end="01:43:53.840" style="s2">Jesus you&#39;re gonna win a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.780" end="01:43:56.360" style="s2">dominance hierarchies Yeah right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.840" end="01:43:58.210" style="s2">going to play in such a way that you get</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.360" end="01:44:00.920" style="s2">to play with the same person over time</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.210" end="01:44:02.540" style="s2">it&#39;s play with a lot of people and you</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.920" end="01:44:04.429" style="s2">create a context in which people play</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.540" end="01:44:06.530" style="s2">with one another because the more people</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.429" end="01:44:08.329" style="s2">play with one another the more they have</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.530" end="01:44:11.960" style="s2">to bring to you in their games and this</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.329" end="01:44:13.579" style="s2">is like the market or you have freedom</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.960" end="01:44:16.369" style="s2">and people get to trade according to</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.579" end="01:44:18.619" style="s2">their desires they trade with the people</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.369" end="01:44:20.989" style="s2">with whom they can play iterated games</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.619" end="01:44:23.449" style="s2">through time the market is an iterated</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.989" end="01:44:25.760" style="s2">game across players it&#39;s a natural Pia</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.449" end="01:44:28.820" style="s2">shedding game yeah how can it spin out</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.760" end="01:44:33.260" style="s2">of control of course yeah right can you</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.820" end="01:44:35.540" style="s2">stop it hmm because iterative organic</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.260" end="01:44:38.960" style="s2">games grow around whatever structures</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.540" end="01:44:44.900" style="s2">you put in place but that process he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.960" end="01:44:53.389" style="s2">saying that the ultimate story of how to</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.900" end="01:44:58.670" style="s2">navigate status hierarchy or social</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.389" end="01:45:02.000" style="s2">hierarchy right that the nature the</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.670" end="01:45:07.690" style="s2">feedback mechanisms of the phad and game</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.000" end="01:45:11.659" style="s2">hypothesis that framework right explains</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.690" end="01:45:13.639" style="s2">how we build up heroes right and those</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.659" end="01:45:15.139" style="s2">heroes get encoded into the stories and</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.639" end="01:45:21.110" style="s2">those stories get encoded into our</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.139" end="01:45:24.070" style="s2">psyche so this pH eddying game serves as</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.110" end="01:45:28.099" style="s2">kind of a pressure in natural selection</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.070" end="01:45:31.250" style="s2">well we&#39;re the people who whose habits</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.099" end="01:45:33.409" style="s2">whose character race style of play</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.250" end="01:45:34.070" style="s2">allows them to play iterated games with</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.409" end="01:45:37.429" style="s2">the same people</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.070" end="01:45:39.079" style="s2">integrated games across people games in</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.429" end="01:45:40.489" style="s2">other people play with people such that</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.079" end="01:45:43.550" style="s2">when they come to your game they bring</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.489" end="01:45:46.780" style="s2">more resources Yeah right when you take</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.550" end="01:45:50.059" style="s2">those three conditions yeah</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.780" end="01:45:53.179" style="s2">they serve as a selection crusher</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.059" end="01:45:55.460" style="s2">you&#39;re an optimal player yeah an optimal</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.179" end="01:45:58.309" style="s2">player gets brought in to stories of</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.460" end="01:46:00.230" style="s2">heroes yeah those heroes get selected</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.309" end="01:46:02.449" style="s2">for overtime until you get an ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.230" end="01:46:05.239" style="s2">hero such as Jesus Christ such as</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.449" end="01:46:08.500" style="s2">Buddha&#39;s such as like such as Luke</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.239" end="01:46:14.230" style="s2">Skywalker such as obi-wan Kenobi right</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.500" end="01:46:14.230" style="s2">right so that ultimate hero</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.889" end="01:46:23.030" style="s2">Jordan Peterson calls that religious</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.860" end="01:46:25.250" style="s2">okay it&#39;s kind of problematical but but</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.030" end="01:46:28.969" style="s2">that process is completely secular the</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.250" end="01:46:31.730" style="s2">pjt and game is a secular explanation</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.969" end="01:46:34.730" style="s2">for morals which is what Piaget said he</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.730" end="01:46:37.190" style="s2">wanted to do and Jordan Peterson says PJ</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.730" end="01:46:39.980" style="s2">was attempting to create a secular basis</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.190" end="01:46:44.000" style="s2">for morality yeah he did such a good job</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.980" end="01:46:48.199" style="s2">that whenever I get pressed I use Piaget</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.000" end="01:46:51.829" style="s2">nians PJs secular morality explanation</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.199" end="01:46:54.860" style="s2">well to justify my quote religious thing</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.829" end="01:46:55.670" style="s2">ya know Sam Harris asked him that</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.860" end="01:46:58.280" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.670" end="01:47:00.770" style="s2">hey Sam Harris is basically saying look</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.280" end="01:47:04.639" style="s2">if we look at if we look at morality we</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.770" end="01:47:08.690" style="s2">can look at Piaget T and games right</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.639" end="01:47:09.500" style="s2">totally right why why do we want to have</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.690" end="01:47:13.099" style="s2">more games</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.500" end="01:47:16.309" style="s2">yeah Yeah right and Sam Harris puts it</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.099" end="01:47:18.020" style="s2">like he says okay if you want to look</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.309" end="01:47:21.679" style="s2">for the ultimate good if we want to say</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.020" end="01:47:23.900" style="s2">that there is a natural good in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.679" end="01:47:26.409" style="s2">universe which does not come from God</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.900" end="01:47:30.400" style="s2">but can be rationally explicate &#39;add and</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.409" end="01:47:33.230" style="s2">articulated from analyzing actual lived</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.400" end="01:47:35.119" style="s2">experience yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.230" end="01:47:38.659" style="s2">he says defining the good is difficult</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.119" end="01:47:42.530" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah but defining bad is</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.659" end="01:47:45.139" style="s2">relatively easy yeah here says that</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.530" end="01:47:49.190" style="s2">Harris says that and he and he offers</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.139" end="01:47:50.199" style="s2">three dimensions yeah he says it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.190" end="01:47:55.389" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.199" end="01:47:58.440" style="s2">Oh Oh for the greatest number of</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.389" end="01:48:03.219" style="s2">creatures for the longest period of time</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.440" end="01:48:04.780" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s bad if you imagine horrible</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.219" end="01:48:06.849" style="s2">suffering for all living beings</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.780" end="01:48:09.880" style="s2">throughout time that&#39;s the worst</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.849" end="01:48:11.889" style="s2">possible outcome right right</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.880" end="01:48:15.880" style="s2">in comparison to the worst possible</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.889" end="01:48:17.650" style="s2">outcome anything with less suffering for</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.880" end="01:48:21.880" style="s2">less creatures over less period of time</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.650" end="01:48:23.199" style="s2">is relatively better right right right</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.880" end="01:48:28.170" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.199" end="01:48:32.409" style="s2">great that&#39;s all the framework we need</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.170" end="01:48:35.440" style="s2">to create a secular morality totally and</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.409" end="01:48:39.309" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially why a PG 18 game</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.440" end="01:48:44.920" style="s2">works because if you win I can see if I</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.309" end="01:48:49.179" style="s2">can answer so I I still don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.920" end="01:48:53.199" style="s2">accounts for what is it that cares about</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.179" end="01:48:55.929" style="s2">paint that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.199" end="01:48:59.050" style="s2">get underneath I&#39;m not saying that that</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.929" end="01:49:00.489" style="s2">makes it fear a lot of logic one so</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.050" end="01:49:02.889" style="s2">let&#39;s ask the question what is it that</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.489" end="01:49:04.900" style="s2">cares about pain yeah okay it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.889" end="01:49:07.449" style="s2">bit like you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.900" end="01:49:09.639" style="s2">all of life&#39;s seems to have that matte</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.449" end="01:49:13.030" style="s2">that are more than almost anything right</p>

<p begin="01:50:38.080" end="01:50:42.940" style="s2">where I think it&#39;s like this guy</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.650" end="01:50:45.190" style="s2">pseudo-dionysius never heard of him no</p>

<p begin="01:50:45.190" end="01:50:51.730" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s basically like it early</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.080" end="01:50:54.730" style="s2">early early Christian religion it</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.730" end="01:50:57.790" style="s2">basically it&#39;s what brings platonic</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.730" end="01:51:00.580" style="s2">philosophy into Christmas well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.790" end="01:51:02.710" style="s2">actually what brings philosophy like</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.580" end="01:51:07.980" style="s2">platonic philosophy into Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.710" end="01:51:11.620" style="s2">thus yeah my origin</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.980" end="01:51:14.200" style="s2">like Latinas yeah yeah so it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.620" end="01:51:16.890" style="s2">plots he talks about it basically talks</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.200" end="01:51:20.080" style="s2">about a negative theology that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.890" end="01:51:24.820" style="s2">and in the French like some of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.080" end="01:51:26.760" style="s2">French phenomenologist Marion Marion who</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.820" end="01:51:30.040" style="s2">wrote the book called God without being</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.760" end="01:51:31.240" style="s2">right basically said that like and this</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.040" end="01:51:33.490" style="s2">is actually kind of it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.240" end="01:51:37.210" style="s2">this is where haider going to ended up</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.490" end="01:51:38.950" style="s2">to this is what I like about cuz I think</p>

<p begin="01:51:38.950" end="01:51:45.160" style="s2">well because he was looking for a</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.610" end="01:51:46.870" style="s2">fundamental ontology right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.160" end="01:51:49.000" style="s2">like that&#39;s what he was trying to do and</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.870" end="01:51:51.580" style="s2">when he wrote being a time right and</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.000" end="01:51:53.770" style="s2">that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t complete it it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:52:13.590" end="01:52:22.889" style="s2">okay so ask answering the question what</p>

<p begin="01:52:22.889" end="01:52:26.699" style="s2">that&#39;s important in some way let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.929" end="01:52:28.860" style="s2">that we don&#39;t answer that let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.699" end="01:52:29.670" style="s2">we leave that unanswered yeah yeah is</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.860" end="01:52:34.110" style="s2">that a problem</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.670" end="01:52:36.449" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s oh no no I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.110" end="01:52:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem but it&#39;s a week it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.449" end="01:52:45.869" style="s2">it&#39;s a something that to contend with</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.400" end="01:52:47.070" style="s2">right like so I&#39;m not like it&#39;s it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.869" end="01:52:48.989" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been having this problem</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.070" end="01:52:50.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having the same kind of issue</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.989" end="01:52:53.010" style="s2">with some of the things when when</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.940" end="01:52:55.860" style="s2">Peterson talks about religion right like</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.010" end="01:52:59.219" style="s2">a nice he does the thing where he tries</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.860" end="01:53:01.679" style="s2">to catch people in the act of valuing</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.219" end="01:53:03.330" style="s2">something and he&#39;s like well how do you</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.679" end="01:53:05.040" style="s2">know basically it&#39;s like no the fact</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.330" end="01:53:07.830" style="s2">that you know the value that that you</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.040" end="01:53:09.599" style="s2">have that goal like has a history and we</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.830" end="01:53:11.880" style="s2">can track it down and its mythic and</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.599" end="01:53:14.159" style="s2">these the axioms there&#39;s a kind of faith</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.880" end="01:53:18.330" style="s2">like having axioms is the kind of faith</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.159" end="01:53:24.179" style="s2">is how I&#39;ve heard him talk about that</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.330" end="01:53:28.110" style="s2">that that there&#39;s something about to</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.179" end="01:53:29.940" style="s2">call that God I think is really</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.110" end="01:53:34.469" style="s2">problematic to call that even religious</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.940" end="01:53:35.969" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really problematic yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.469" end="01:53:39.810" style="s2">I actually don&#39;t have an answer for it</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.969" end="01:53:41.940" style="s2">but okay okay so so for fun what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.810" end="01:53:44.070" style="s2">interesting though it&#39;s also just what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.940" end="01:53:48.810" style="s2">interesting though is what&#39;s bizarre to</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.070" end="01:53:50.880" style="s2">me about that is that okay somehow</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.810" end="01:53:53.699" style="s2">whatever that is I don&#39;t have an answer</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.880" end="01:53:56.940" style="s2">for which seems to give constitute how</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.699" end="01:54:01.320" style="s2">everything else goes has everything else</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.940" end="01:54:03.570" style="s2">go so in some way what is going is</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.320" end="01:54:07.110" style="s2">revealing something that is really</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.570" end="01:54:08.940" style="s2">mysterious right and there&#39;s a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.110" end="01:54:10.800" style="s2">approach where it&#39;s like with science</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.940" end="01:54:12.389" style="s2">when you take the subjectivity out right</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.800" end="01:54:16.670" style="s2">which i think is where Sam&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.389" end="01:54:20.099" style="s2">Sam&#39;s going like look like I think I</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.670" end="01:54:25.290" style="s2">think Peterson would say that like that</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.099" end="01:54:27.420" style="s2">science is its side of religion right</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.290" end="01:54:30.030" style="s2">and I basically think what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.420" end="01:54:32.160" style="s2">is that that horizon in the background</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.030" end="01:54:35.239" style="s2">that you can&#39;t explicitly you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.160" end="01:54:38.400" style="s2">explicate scientifically right is</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.239" end="01:54:41.969" style="s2">because the thing that gives science</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.400" end="01:54:43.679" style="s2">right isn&#39;t scientific and I think</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.969" end="01:54:46.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the basic argument he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.679" end="01:54:47.730" style="s2">say right but I don&#39;t even I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.320" end="01:54:50.730" style="s2">it makes sense to necessarily call that</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.730" end="01:54:53.130" style="s2">religious so but he&#39;s kind of mystical</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.730" end="01:54:54.449" style="s2">okay so so and this is let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.130" end="01:54:56.880" style="s2">postmodern stance of this for a moment</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.449" end="01:55:00.390" style="s2">yeah like a rose by any other name</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.880" end="01:55:03.000" style="s2">smells just as sweet but what you call</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.390" end="01:55:06.360" style="s2">something matters yeah when you call</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.000" end="01:55:09.510" style="s2">something religious you are using a word</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.360" end="01:55:12.270" style="s2">that has a cachet yeah there was a lot</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.510" end="01:55:15.750" style="s2">of meanings behind it yeah so when you</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.270" end="01:55:18.630" style="s2">say calling it religious is problematic</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.750" end="01:55:21.060" style="s2">right it&#39;s problematic in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.630" end="01:55:22.590" style="s2">it brings in a lot of meanings that</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.060" end="01:55:24.120" style="s2">people have a lot of thoughts around and</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.590" end="01:55:26.910" style="s2">when you grab that religious you get</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.120" end="01:55:29.280" style="s2">people like sam harris saying that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.910" end="01:55:31.110" style="s2">religious yeah and now you get into a</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.280" end="01:55:33.030" style="s2">semantic set of arguments and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.110" end="01:55:36.030" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing with this truth thing</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.030" end="01:55:39.270" style="s2">okay yes again if you look around the</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.030" end="01:55:43.410" style="s2">room as an interior decorator mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.270" end="01:55:47.550" style="s2">yeah the things that you notice the</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.410" end="01:55:48.900" style="s2">things that matter are completely</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.550" end="01:55:53.219" style="s2">different than if you look around the</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.900" end="01:55:56.520" style="s2">room as a fire but as an architect like</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.219" end="01:55:59.489" style="s2">the things that exist exist in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.520" end="01:56:01.679" style="s2">context of your goals yeah and so it is</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.489" end="01:56:04.199" style="s2">certainly the case that science exists</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.679" end="01:56:07.560" style="s2">in the context of a fundamental goal set</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.199" end="01:56:09.600" style="s2">which i think sam harris can summarize</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.560" end="01:56:12.120" style="s2">very neatly as the desire to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.600" end="01:56:12.870" style="s2">suffering and to go towards the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.120" end="01:56:15.000" style="s2">of suffering</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.870" end="01:56:17.310" style="s2">yeah which happens to be extreme</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.000" end="01:56:20.660" style="s2">pleasure and beauty and intimacy and</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.310" end="01:56:22.980" style="s2">depth and wonder in awe for the most</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.660" end="01:56:24.929" style="s2">Yelling&#39;s and consciousness over the</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.980" end="01:56:28.110" style="s2">longest period of time and we can call</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.929" end="01:56:30.929" style="s2">that thriving yeah so you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.110" end="01:56:34.170" style="s2">get the good by examining the bad which</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.929" end="01:56:36.360" style="s2">is incontrovertible as as jordan</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.170" end="01:56:39.120" style="s2">peterson says life is suffering is the</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.360" end="01:56:40.440" style="s2">thing that you can&#39;t avoid yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.120" end="01:56:42.870" style="s2">great he</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.440" end="01:56:45.360" style="s2">and sam harris are in the same boat yeah</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.870" end="01:56:47.610" style="s2">and when he says that that is a secular</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.360" end="01:56:50.280" style="s2">argument it is not a religious argument</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.610" end="01:56:53.190" style="s2">yes it is true that religious figures</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.280" end="01:56:55.050" style="s2">have attempted to confront that yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.190" end="01:56:59.969" style="s2">yeah it does not make that realization</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.050" end="01:57:02.520" style="s2">religious yeah totally okay but now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.969" end="01:57:04.050" style="s2">front using the term religion is front i</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.520" end="01:57:05.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s fine if you use the word</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.050" end="01:57:07.110" style="s2">religion well you just have to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.910" end="01:57:08.940" style="s2">everybody&#39;s playing the same game with</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.110" end="01:57:10.739" style="s2">the word and he doesn&#39;t do yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.940" end="01:57:12.420" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole problem it&#39;s a semantic</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.739" end="01:57:16.199" style="s2">postmodern problem which he showed</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.420" end="01:57:18.600" style="s2">better about bad bad right seems like it</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.199" end="01:57:19.620" style="s2">seems like there&#39;s got to be a new word</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.600" end="01:57:22.620" style="s2">here or something</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.620" end="01:57:23.880" style="s2">wait now now I think another way of</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.620" end="01:57:27.449" style="s2">bringing in the thing that you said</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.880" end="01:57:30.180" style="s2">which is what is it the cares yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.449" end="01:57:33.780" style="s2">okay now you can take a pan psychic view</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.180" end="01:57:36.719" style="s2">of that and say that like everything</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.780" end="01:57:37.739" style="s2">that exists exists in relation to</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.719" end="01:57:40.820" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.739" end="01:57:45.480" style="s2">well quarks exist in relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.820" end="01:57:47.310" style="s2">other things atoms and nuclei exist in</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.480" end="01:57:49.430" style="s2">relationship that electrons and</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.310" end="01:57:52.560" style="s2">electrons and molecules exist in</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.430" end="01:57:55.440" style="s2">proteins and cells and beings and</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.560" end="01:57:59.370" style="s2">ecosystems they all exist in contexts</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.440" end="01:58:04.469" style="s2">and you know Whitehead calls</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.370" end="01:58:07.260" style="s2">apprehension yeah right right that</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.469" end="01:58:10.050" style="s2">you&#39;re actually feeling that which is</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.260" end="01:58:13.050" style="s2">you&#39;re in relationship to yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.050" end="01:58:15.270" style="s2">that is the precursor of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.050" end="01:58:17.340" style="s2">right right there&#39;s this guy named</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.270" end="01:58:21.900" style="s2">Terence Deakin which by the way local</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.340" end="01:58:23.969" style="s2">guy Berkeley is the awesome is either</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.900" end="01:58:27.800" style="s2">guy that wrote in complete nature yeah</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.969" end="01:58:30.300" style="s2">yeah yeah he&#39;s cool he&#39;s very cool yeah</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.800" end="01:58:32.880" style="s2">and and he takes us to a much deeper</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.300" end="01:58:34.650" style="s2">level but we can say you can either take</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.880" end="01:58:37.530" style="s2">a pan psychic approach and say that all</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.650" end="01:58:39.900" style="s2">of nature&#39;s is conscious in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.530" end="01:58:41.880" style="s2">that it senses other things that it</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.900" end="01:58:43.980" style="s2">exists in the context of other things</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.880" end="01:58:45.570" style="s2">and therefore it has to have a way of</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.980" end="01:58:47.730" style="s2">connecting to those other things and</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.570" end="01:58:50.610" style="s2">that connection is the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.730" end="01:58:52.410" style="s2">consciousness pain psychic approach or</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.610" end="01:58:54.239" style="s2">you can say that the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.410" end="01:58:58.019" style="s2">replicating organism</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.239" end="01:59:00.840" style="s2">or replicating structures can reach a</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.019" end="01:59:04.230" style="s2">point where you get multiple processes</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.840" end="01:59:08.760" style="s2">in dynamic tension yeah totally and that</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.230" end="01:59:11.099" style="s2">dynamic tension yeah when you get layers</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.760" end="01:59:14.090" style="s2">upon layers and orders of magnitude of</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.099" end="01:59:18.809" style="s2">these dynamic tensions coming together</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.090" end="01:59:20.309" style="s2">create an awareness of how to hold that</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.809" end="01:59:21.510" style="s2">structure together and the human</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.309" end="01:59:23.449" style="s2">consciousness consciousness in general</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.510" end="01:59:26.610" style="s2">and human consciousness in particular is</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.449" end="01:59:28.710" style="s2">the awareness of the dynamic structures</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.610" end="01:59:33.510" style="s2">as they interplay with one another yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.710" end="01:59:36.900" style="s2">totally phenomenological thing built</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.510" end="01:59:38.249" style="s2">into the system yeah yeah and how that</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.900" end="01:59:40.800" style="s2">relates back to is what is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.249" end="01:59:43.199" style="s2">that cares well in the nature of human</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.800" end="01:59:44.579" style="s2">beings and brains and these animals</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.199" end="01:59:46.920" style="s2">which are conscious and them this kind</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.579" end="01:59:52.249" style="s2">of reflective self-consciousness which</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.920" end="01:59:56.610" style="s2">is human in which we have language like</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.249" end="01:59:59.909" style="s2">he calls us the symbolic species right</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.610" end="02:00:01.829" style="s2">it like we we have language and language</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.909" end="02:00:05.730" style="s2">creates a certain kind of dynamic</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.829" end="02:00:08.249" style="s2">tension yeah that allows us to abstract</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.730" end="02:00:10.619" style="s2">and began to abstract our abstractions</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.249" end="02:00:14.429" style="s2">until we can create the self and this is</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.619" end="02:00:18.239" style="s2">how we create worlds yeah 3s symbols so</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.429" end="02:00:21.119" style="s2">they are a symbolic species yeah</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.239" end="02:00:26.179" style="s2">and therefore the reason we care that</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.119" end="02:00:31.499" style="s2">which cares is the network of symbols</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.179" end="02:00:33.090" style="s2">yep yep yep so in that case it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.499" end="02:00:37.650" style="s2">network of symbols that can recognize</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.090" end="02:00:40.499" style="s2">that suffering is bad that suffering for</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.650" end="02:00:42.210" style="s2">multiple creatures is worse that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.499" end="02:00:45.780" style="s2">suffering for multiple creatures through</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.210" end="02:00:47.940" style="s2">time is the worst we can abstract that</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.780" end="02:00:50.159" style="s2">process and therefore we can get a good</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.940" end="02:00:52.590" style="s2">we can recognize what it&#39;s like to feel</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.159" end="02:00:54.210" style="s2">pleasure yeah and that feeling pleasure</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.590" end="02:00:55.829" style="s2">across multiple beings and not just</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.210" end="02:00:59.809" style="s2">physical pleasure but also mental</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.829" end="02:01:02.610" style="s2">pleasure success and joy and and and</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.809" end="02:01:05.400" style="s2">spiritual pleasure of realization and</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.610" end="02:01:07.090" style="s2">intimacy and appreciation of beauty and</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.400" end="02:01:09.340" style="s2">structure and symmetry and</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.090" end="02:01:12.340" style="s2">pattern like all of these levels of</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.340" end="02:01:13.060" style="s2">pleasure or more beings across time</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.340" end="02:01:16.390" style="s2">that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.060" end="02:01:20.200" style="s2">we can abstract that we are the symbolic</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.390" end="02:01:23.530" style="s2">species that can abstract that what is</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.200" end="02:01:25.990" style="s2">that we are that now in a sense I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.530" end="02:01:27.520" style="s2">think you need to answer that you know</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.990" end="02:01:32.170" style="s2">we have to do a Jordan Peterson move</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.520" end="02:01:37.210" style="s2">which is let&#39;s just look at what our</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.170" end="02:01:39.330" style="s2">culture has decided is good and bad but</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.210" end="02:01:44.730" style="s2">let&#39;s look at that systematically</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.330" end="02:01:44.730" style="s2">scientifically right if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.420" end="02:01:49.450" style="s2">challenge I have what Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.560" end="02:01:55.030" style="s2">that he has not done the psycho metrics</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.450" end="02:01:58.000" style="s2">of myth well he has not taken all of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.030" end="02:02:01.030" style="s2">myths and read them through psychometric</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.000" end="02:02:04.450" style="s2">tests so that he can pull out and do the</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.030" end="02:02:06.870" style="s2">factor analysis yeah I&#39;ve done that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.450" end="02:02:11.320" style="s2">done that intuitively like a case study</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.870" end="02:02:18.100" style="s2">yeah yeah totally yeah I think that he</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.320" end="02:02:21.730" style="s2">should marry and he should use a</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.100" end="02:02:23.860" style="s2">scientific method on the myth so we can</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.730" end="02:02:25.630" style="s2">find out what is suffering what is not</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.860" end="02:02:27.790" style="s2">suffering and use the collective</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.630" end="02:02:30.730" style="s2">knowledge of our culture to figure out</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.790" end="02:02:32.470" style="s2">the factors and then figure out what are</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.730" end="02:02:34.480" style="s2">the stories that facilitate the</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.470" end="02:02:35.920" style="s2">development towards better now it still</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.480" end="02:02:37.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t answer how do you determine</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.920" end="02:02:39.910" style="s2">better and you can say that that&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.990" end="02:02:43.500" style="s2">in and that&#39;s religious and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.910" end="02:02:47.410" style="s2">an inborn better I like to say reason</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.500" end="02:02:49.410" style="s2">requires a reason to use it yeah well</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.410" end="02:02:55.750" style="s2">because this word reason has two major</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.410" end="02:02:57.400" style="s2">uses one is logic like reason is to be</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.750" end="02:02:59.350" style="s2">logical it&#39;s to use a set of logical</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.400" end="02:03:02.380" style="s2">inferences you use a set of procedures</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.350" end="02:03:05.650" style="s2">and iterative procedures to do the</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.380" end="02:03:08.770" style="s2">arithmetic to do the math of calculation</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.650" end="02:03:11.410" style="s2">for valid conclusions based on right so</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.770" end="02:03:13.150" style="s2">there&#39;s logic but then there&#39;s values</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.410" end="02:03:17.070" style="s2">and I go through the difference between</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.150" end="02:03:19.480" style="s2">logic and rationality logic has reason</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.070" end="02:03:20.970" style="s2">rationality is reason rationality</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.480" end="02:03:23.520" style="s2">requires a goal</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.970" end="02:03:24.930" style="s2">is it rational to do the thing you have</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.520" end="02:03:29.070" style="s2">to do logic but you have to have a goal</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.930" end="02:03:30.990" style="s2">right does it lead to the goal then it</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.070" end="02:03:33.120" style="s2">is rational to do it to achieve the goal</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.990" end="02:03:35.880" style="s2">does it lead away from the goal than it</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.120" end="02:03:38.970" style="s2">is irrational might be logical but</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.880" end="02:03:40.830" style="s2">irrational right reason requires a</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.970" end="02:03:42.360" style="s2">reason to use it there is reason in</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.830" end="02:03:45.950" style="s2">terms of logic and reason in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.360" end="02:03:48.480" style="s2">values yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.950" end="02:03:51.660" style="s2">Jordan Peterson says it&#39;s the values</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.480" end="02:03:53.760" style="s2">that determines the logic fan Harrison</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.660" end="02:03:57.330" style="s2">says yeah but we use logic to determine</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.760" end="02:04:00.000" style="s2">which values are best and yes there is a</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.330" end="02:04:04.260" style="s2">spiral but when we get down to it we can</p>
