<p begin="00:00:29.119" end="00:00:34.480" style="s2">i was like anyway so that is how</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:36.160" style="s2">solution raising went solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.480" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">is an hour long conversation we generate</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.160" end="00:00:40.719" style="s2">solutions with</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:42.800" style="s2">10 000 people 100 000 my focus right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.719" end="00:00:44.480" style="s2">is on my own existential crisis of how</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.800" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">to get the mlm in the world with my</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.480" end="00:00:48.160" style="s2">limited capacity and like which</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">direction to take it in</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.160" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">and so right now i&#39;m focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">product itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:54.399" style="s2">and finding people who enjoy the product</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">want the product to want to build that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.399" end="00:00:57.760" style="s2">out um because it&#39;s easier than either</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">figuring it out for the community or</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.760" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">everyone wants it on the business</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">structure but not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:02.800" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">um and the community is is most of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.800" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">people that i know are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:09.680" style="s2">with that same with the same ideal of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">community that i have but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.680" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">unless it&#39;s explicitly stated it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of gray area of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:19.759" style="s2">if you&#39;re not saying that we&#39;re here for</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:20.560" style="s2">diversity and authenticity then then</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">that can arise</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.560" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">um and that is what i&#39;ve been up to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">last week because i i did do a</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">was kind of all over the place but</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s also what i who i am my</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">eccentric crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">who would like to go next</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.320" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">i can go next uh so my main project is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.759" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">converati</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">it is a source of uh information that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">earns your trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s meant to provide information on</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">science and news</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">and then the partner project wikilection</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:24.080" style="s2">which does the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:25.840" style="s2">provides information that earns your</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.080" end="00:02:28.959" style="s2">trust for politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.840" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">um i&#39;ve been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.959" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">on hold ish for the last couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">been waiting for the new version of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">prototype to come out</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">uh while i&#39;ve been working on that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">been working on the sort of specs for</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">the conference platform and in doing so</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">have decided that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">the overall decision of development</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">should or the direction of development</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">should probably change and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:51.519" style="s2">focus a bit more on uh it being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">platform as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">just a typical coded application um</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">so theoretically we might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">talk about that today</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">if nothing else comes up but that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">would probably get fairly</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">technical so i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">i&#39;m up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">okay and uh i&#39;m bentley davis um</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">my i got a couple projects i&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">on one is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">i&#39;m going to say goaliebot which is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">a chatbot that builds mass agreement</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">across the world in theory if it works</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">i haven&#39;t done anything on that project</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">i&#39;m really getting inspired on another</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">project which is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">generic rating and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">reporting system that allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">grade everything which is also a part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:50.159" style="s2">contrary</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">and wikilection so yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.159" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">want to work on building that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">and putting it in other spheres i also i</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">think i mentioned last time i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">got a day job so i&#39;m working part-time</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">on a startup</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">that&#39;s also about information processing</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">creating digital books that also</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">have an interactive component to them so</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">you&#39;re able to get it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">content uh link out to content more</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:24.079" style="s2">conveniently</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:24.079" style="s2">and we hope it it makes it a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">a deeper and more valuable experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">than just reading the text</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">and more so than the current book</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:38.170" style="s2">systems that exist today</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see if that works out</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.170" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">yeah i have had some interesting</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">funding so we&#39;re doing a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">just uh was in a meeting with the</p>

<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">projects that have to do with argument</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">and then i met a guy named doran</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">who has an idea for a project that helps</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:20.479" style="s2">handle internal conflicts which then he</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">hopes</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:26.639" style="s2">would allow people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">also handle external conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.639" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">better so lots of things going on but</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">mostly i&#39;m moving and i&#39;m resetting up</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">my studio</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">uh and right now my desk is in a rare</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">um so we&#39;ll see how it goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">all right you know it looks sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">you have the most um</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">you know it makes more sense for you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">be lusty you have a need for something</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">can you</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">re-explain i know i might not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">add to the technical part but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:03.440" style="s2">why you&#39;re thinking that a coded app</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to work in a platform</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.440" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">would be right the way to first of all</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">good job keeping track of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:13.360" style="s2">the terms um so the coded app</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">is sort of like every page is is coded</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.360" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">right so like if</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">if um so for example the most recent</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">change for</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">wiki election the existing prototype</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">tracks people attracts organizations</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">and attracts the role that the people</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">have held at organizations so very</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">the next layer was meant to track</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">legislation and then how people had</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">voted on</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">legislation and then there was also that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">extra layer of what bentley was talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:39.199" style="s2">where it was sort of the the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">add things that you could score</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.199" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">legislation on um right like is it good</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">environment or bad for the environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">good for business bad for her business</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">um and then based on how somebody voted</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">it would</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">affect that you know the same score for</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">the person to vote</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">so if you vote for something that&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">for the environment your score gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">worse for the environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">um so that was sort of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.639" style="s2">where it&#39;s at right now and then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">thing that we were working on</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.639" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">and i think a big part of why it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">stuck was the the scoring</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">um but also to just the fact that like</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">the two were tied together</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">and a lot of the like i guess what i</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">would go object</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">level stuff so an object is like one</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">individual table in the database so like</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">people or organizations or</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">legislation those would all be objects</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">i mean this the layouts for all those</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">pages will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">not the same but like the same basic</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">principle of your showing fields</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">from a record um</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">and there are a number of other</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:48.319" style="s2">applications out there that allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.319" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">create objects and create you know extra</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">fields in those tables</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">and then it&#39;s easier to add them to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">layouts so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:07:58.879" style="s2">sort of like a canvas so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">say here&#39;s your list of fields</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.879" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">here&#39;s a blank page tell us where you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">want them and then you can drag out</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">fields</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s different like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:11.759" style="s2">uh a lot of how salesforce works where</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">they have their own developers that go</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.759" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">develop that platform and then other</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">people that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">developers can essentially make things</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">on their platform right can kind of make</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">apps</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">um and add objects and fields and say</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">you know how they look</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:29.199" style="s2">um and it wouldn&#39;t need to be even one</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">percent of what salesforce does but but</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.199" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">the basic idea of like you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">add tables add fields</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">add the pages as they will be linked and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">then at that point</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">someone like me could probably go in and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">just change</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">what would that what would be the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">meta data or like data that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">actually data</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">or it could get i i guess you could say</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">data about data</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">um and so that is sort of the back end</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">if we had a coder build the platform and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">then they might still need to add tables</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">and fields and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">but once those existed then i could just</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:06.959" style="s2">go in there and say okay this layout</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">should have this field here</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.959" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">this field here these sections show this</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">and as the platform builds out we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">start to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">make those same sort of changes on all</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">of the the pages</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">plus the the same thing should be used</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:21.519" style="s2">for conferrati</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">and for for wiki election it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.519" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">two sides of the same coin</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">and there will almost certainly be more</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">apps like</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">wiki election we&#39;re sort of an offshoot</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">of converation accessing the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">overall</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">data set but like with a a unique view</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">into it but but with the same overall</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:42.959" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">way to build your how the fields appear</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">page um you know where they&#39;re ordered</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">what links to what</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">all that type of thing does that make</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">a lot of that was over my head but kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">of so if we put in lego terms</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">um you&#39;re looking like as the consumer</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">as the person the user</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">um when you were talking about building</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">blocks is that for um</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">like different websites that i&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">to and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">how it&#39;s built or as the user am i</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">configuring that for my</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">for my page you know what i mean like is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">it my facebook and i get to choose where</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:19.120" style="s2">everything is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">or is facebook its own thing and then if</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.120" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">i come on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">it has it but if they wanted to use that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">same piece for</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">twitter and twitter wouldn&#39;t it be for</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">for users at least not for</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">the i would say even far future like</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">that&#39;s theoretically possible that&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">down the road it&#39;s more meant to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">split</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">the the quote-unquote development</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">responsibilities where actual</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">programmers would be building</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">the platform and somebody like me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">technical but not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">programmer can go in there sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">know learn okay here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">she designed a page right it might end</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">up being like so you&#39;re looking to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">the lego blocks yes because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">know how to make the lego blocks you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">want to put the links lego is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">really good example</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like instead currently we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">building you know a toy</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">and instead we&#39;re saying no no instead</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">let&#39;s build lego so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">it&#39;s just pieces that in this case</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">that&#39;s where it kind of falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">because it&#39;s meant for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:15.440" style="s2">end user to to build something in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">case it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">the developers build the pieces they</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">give them to me i construct something</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">and then that&#39;s what i put out in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:26.399" style="s2">world through you know confronti through</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">wikileaks etc and a part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.399" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">platform is also to support</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">like they&#39;re being different for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">domain names like</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">wikilection.com or conference.com it</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">would actually be did</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">different apps because they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">views into two data</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">like conferrati might not have a special</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">section for</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">legislation whereas of course wiki</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">election would</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">confront would show like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">bunch of corporations and businesses of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">all sides</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">but whereas wiki election would only</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">show like</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">political parties lobbying groups things</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">that are direct like organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">are directly connected to politics</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">but still the same overall data set and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">that same thing powering it</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.800" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">so i know what bentley&#39;s doing with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">rating system</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">is more like a i&#39;m going to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">back to lego like a lego construction</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:16.399" style="s2">set</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">like a um wow instructions</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s like you can build anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">with it it&#39;s kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">the thing that the event is talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">about is like one of those really weird</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.880" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">lego pieces right that you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">it&#39;s cool you&#39;re like it might be like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">a special part of a spaceship</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">or something where like you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">build that with just the lego pieces</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">and you can you know reuse it wherever</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:37.839" style="s2">you see a spot for it</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">but like it kind of does have a a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.839" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">specialized purpose</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">in this case it might actually make it a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">bit easier because then you can say okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">here&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">thing that does the scoring and then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">can actually say okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">the different settings that you can do</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">here&#39;s the you know where we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">storing the different scoring values</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">here&#39;s the different sets of scores</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">what objects we&#39;re saying are the things</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">that get ranked</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">and then here are the objects that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">actually get scored so in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">wiki election you could say the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">legislation are are the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:09.760" style="s2">actually being like</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">directly scored or ranked and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.760" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">the votes will be the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">guess are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.959" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">counted to help affect that in the end</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">and then in the very end</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">the the politicians are the people that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">sort of get automatically scored through</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">that system</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">so we&#39;d obviously want like some better</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">terms to to categorize things</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">but it becomes easier in in in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">if you can just say here&#39;s this here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:34.399" style="s2">how it connects you define each of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">variables like</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.399" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">you know where&#39;s the score being stored</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">what are we counting and where is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">actually being calculated</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">you can specify those three things you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">can use it pretty much anywhere across</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">the platform as long as you&#39;re following</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">the rules of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">and so is the idea i think with this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">how i understand it with bentley&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the equipment we&#39;re working out on</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the something that you can plug and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">play in different places anywhere you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">need that rating system</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea that it can be more more</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">generic because a lot of people trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">to solve this</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">whereas um who is which one of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">is doing it like the data itself is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">repetitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">so if we put in the politicians</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">and we know who they vote if someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">else has to have that information they</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have to you know like</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">his feels like it&#39;s the software that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">plug and playable or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">the thing we&#39;re working out on whereas</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">yours is yours looking at not having to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">put in that same information every time</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">as well and so if i use that same widget</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">on my thing it has it comes with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">information yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">in the fairly soon future like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">should be fairly soon into</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">to to the app where you can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">query something and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">i want to make you know a chrome</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">extension that if i&#39;m reading news it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">looks for names that we know about and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">then you know shows a side panel</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">i would definitely like something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">that to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">to be possible now how open it is and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">stuff like that i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">but definitely that&#39;s how i i i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">to be used</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">even if you know it&#39;s actually con</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">ferrari that ends up making</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">the the chrome extension um</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">but i do want there to be some ability</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">for other services to sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">ask for</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">for certain pieces of data even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.199" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">just hey who&#39;s this person and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">their score in these areas</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">yeah i i have a couple thoughts uh maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">i am fading in and out i wonder maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">could go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">stop your guys videos and see if that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">clears it up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">otherwise i don&#39;t know if you all be</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">able to hear me either right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">um good i mean hopefully it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">it&#39;s prioritizing income you know my</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">outgoing data rather than the incoming</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">um so so yeah i mean really what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">want is you you</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.759" end="00:15:52.079" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re asking for a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:53.920" style="s2">functionality kind of like knack</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.079" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">not all of nak of course but just that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.920" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">ability to kind of configure</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:16:00.320" style="s2">the displays and bubble and all that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of a no code solution</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.320" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">um right although in this case i</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be as attached to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">like the front end that gets kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">weird</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:12.000" style="s2">uh being all that nice right like even</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:14.720" style="s2">if the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">the designing of the page is just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.720" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">kind of code-ish right like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:20.320" style="s2">some sort of a document like a json file</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">or something i would go in there and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.320" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">learn the syntax of and then i can you</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:27.519" style="s2">say like here&#39;s the field here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">where it is on the page</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.519" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">i i think with a little bit of training</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:34.959" style="s2">you could do that today</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">totally yeah yeah i&#39;ve i i do that kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.959" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">of thing at work like</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of thing where really</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">basic syntax you know and like using</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:43.600" style="s2">field name stuff like that i can do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">yeah and so if we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">allow that to be sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">bottleneck for</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">i guess kind of like the actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">translation of what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">back end to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">front end of here are the objects that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">this app uses</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">here are the fields on the layout</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">there&#39;s probably going to be a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:01.120" style="s2">extra in the back end that most</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">people won&#39;t care about but will track</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.120" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">just in case</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">and then you know if i want to add a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:07.039" style="s2">field or to take a field off i can just</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">go edit this certain file</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.039" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">and then i don&#39;t have to you know ask a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">developer and do this and go through a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">whole bunch of stuff and go</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">through testing because the the testing</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:17.919" style="s2">would mostly be at the platform level on</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">you know adding fields on taking fields</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.919" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">off do things work together</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">that&#39;s right we&#39;d have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">i guess is that are you editing</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">because if you want those changes to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">live then we need to get a what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">a continuous deployment</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">which is doable that&#39;s all built in to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">github but then we&#39;d also have to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">sure that your changes</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">are merged into the developer</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">the test version that that radical i</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">would be working on which</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">is doable um i mean i guess</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">the goal is for the thing that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:57.919" style="s2">that radic and possibly you would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">working on would be the platform that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.919" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">would translate whatever these files are</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">right so like those</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">what what what would be the things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.840" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">would actually be in in</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">github and then sort of their job</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">like the job of the platform is to so</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">you know take a look at what objects are</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">take a look at sort of what app they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">at right are they at</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">wiki election or conference or something</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">else and each of those would end up</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">having its own sort of you know set of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">files or set up</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">settings that they would say okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">wikilection so we&#39;re gonna go over to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">this you know grouping of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">settings and say things right like here</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">here are the top level objects right</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">there&#39;s home there&#39;s there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">there&#39;s organizations there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">elections legislation stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">so if you click it&#39;ll it&#39;ll all be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">between because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">some of that is extremely complex and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">would take a long time to develop</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that you want to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">it would be worth the time</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">to build that right when really you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">still i mean i guess</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">are you thinking that this is still a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">prototype or is it a beta software</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">you want beta because you want users to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">end up</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">using it oh it&#39;s a combination between</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">because really could be either</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">at this point i i guess i want to shift</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">because i think that the platform is</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">sort of a better long-term</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">approach and so and but but i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.280" style="s2">if we can get the bare bones part</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">working and put</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">you know a bit more of the onus on me</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">then i can do part of the development</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">myself right yeah but unless unless it</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">takes us longer to build a platform than</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">it would for us</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">right which is what i think it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">to be and also you don&#39;t need a platform</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">you get a certain level of functionality</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">right well that&#39;s where it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">iffy because there&#39;s probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">end up being a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:56.080" style="s2">portals sort of into the conference</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.080" end="00:19:59.919" style="s2">right like they&#39;re like for right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">confronti is</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.919" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">kind of the name for bulky platform and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">they&#39;re going to end up being this</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">busy probably mess of an app that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:11.039" style="s2">doing you know 100</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">different things and so i expect that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.039" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">wiki election is going to be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">cleaner because it&#39;s kind of got more</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">specific purpose and over time i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">expect certain things to start splitting</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">off of confronting right like if the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:25.200" style="s2">review part gets big and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">of pieces and it it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:28.960" style="s2">it it makes sense to give its own portal</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">i imagine that will end up happening at</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.960" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">some point</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">so my understanding from what radical is</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">working on</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">is that he made it to where the data</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:43.520" style="s2">is stored kind of abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">but he hadn&#39;t gone in and changed the ui</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.520" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">toward displays that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">so his goal was actually to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">to what you want to do for the rating</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">which is also what i need because i</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">remember i&#39;m making a generic rating</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">system so the users need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">go in and say</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">i want to create a legislature a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">legislative</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">person and then i want right these are</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">the judge</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">you know these are the the categories</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">the attributes that i want to rate</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">so that was all part of the plan so what</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">i believe he had done</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">back when he showed us the demo was the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">back end was flexible like that but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">front end was all hard-coded</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">right so my understanding is he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">making that front-end more flexible now</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.960" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">the thing is though is that that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:29.840" style="s2">for the rating</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:31.360" style="s2">system part to build which is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">very specific scope</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.360" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">so building a dynamic interface for that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">is reasonable um some of the other pages</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">though i don&#39;t know we&#39;d have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">i just</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">so yeah i mean definitely i think we</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">talk it through and figure out where we</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">can do it i would i do want to caution</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.559" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">though that there will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">it sounds like i don&#39;t know that there</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">will be it sounds like there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">of sections and pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">the workload to make those dynamic might</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">more than is worthwhile right right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">okay but yeah we definitely have that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">discussion but then also</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">much of wiki election and conferrati is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:18.799" style="s2">just an</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">implement implementation of the generic</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.799" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">rating system</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">and which which is fine i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">definitely an important layer of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">well yeah so what i just</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">i guess i don&#39;t know what i mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:39.840" style="s2">you&#39;d need that evidence-based i just</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">it might be nice to list out your</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.840" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">feature set and say</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.679" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">which features are is the rating system</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">and which features aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:50.159" style="s2">just so we have an idea of because you</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">know your</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.159" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">code is still going to be closed source</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">but my hope is that the rating system</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.640" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">would be open source right um so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.280" style="s2">even though it wouldn&#39;t have the data</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">that says here&#39;s the representative and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">all the stuff or even the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.880" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">the structure of a representative has</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">these attributes</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">um that would never be open sourced</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">um but the code that lets you represent</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">that would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">so it might be good if we drew some</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">boxes around what&#39;s the rating system</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:23.360" style="s2">and what&#39;s not and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">uh yeah so do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.360" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">feature list yet um</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">yep it&#39;s uh it&#39;s kind of spread apart</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:32.240" style="s2">different things and it&#39;s in there oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like where it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.240" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">this one um</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:39.120" style="s2">so it might be nice if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">consolidated that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.120" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">in some sort of table form</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">and then um said which one of those</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">features are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">fulfilled in the rating system and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">also get a prioritization from you on it</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">which i think the rating system is still</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">the top</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">priority um</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">i guess i don&#39;t know a spreadsheet of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">those he&#39;s like i&#39;m looking through</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">the materials that i have for con</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">ferrari and for wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">and like it sort of talks about how some</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">of the features would be used but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">call them out into a list um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;d be nice if you could put</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">that together and then we could schedule</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">yeah for sure yeah i&#39;ve been good good</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">going through and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">drawing up some of the really basic</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">requirements for</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">the platform and to your point maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">ends up being like a weird</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">hybrid platform where like i do it</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t need to be a very you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">know polished back end like if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">me editing text files</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">that that&#39;s fine um and if i have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">check stuff in to github i can learn how</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">to to do that i&#39;m sure um at this point</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">just about trying to simplify the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">process of you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">adding a new object and then a new page</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">for it like that shouldn&#39;t be a week&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">thing that should be you know an hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">max</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">be like you know after the table&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">already been headed and we know the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">fields and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">we we know the layout that should be you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">know okay here&#39;s the layout for</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">these fields go here okay and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">here&#39;s another section where</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be listing the votes and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">here are the columns to use</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">okay now go render that yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">so i think as far as it&#39;s within the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">rating system thing they&#39;ll definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">be doable</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">another thing we might consider is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:30.640" style="s2">uh use a content management system</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">for the like the home page and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">description pages</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">and the blog i don&#39;t know if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">blog on there but you probably need one</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">for content</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">marketing um yeah i mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">that there will end up being a set up</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">for it yeah and and that&#39;s where like</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">each individual table kind of like or</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">the records need the ability to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">some amount</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">of rich text um and so depending i mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">it could end up being like some objects</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">might just be a single table that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">that are just the rich text right but</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">i&#39;m distinguishing between</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">your kind of the data and then your your</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">more like blogish description marketing</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">right yeah i don&#39;t think that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">build a content management system</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">into no and that&#39;s where like</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">and i think this is probably true for</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">both conferrati and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">wiki election where like there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">to be a website for it</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">right which is going to be on some form</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">of acms and there might be blogs and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">know and links up to youtube and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:36.840" style="s2">and then there will be the actual app</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:41.279" style="s2">right where it&#39;s probably like</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.840" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">app.com or app.wikilection.com</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">which is where the the prototype is um</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s how you actually access the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">application but then for the media the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">blogs the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">the press releases that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">that goes on the website</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">so i generally try and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">keep those on the same domain there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">ways to separate out</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">developing well app</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">dot i&#39;m saying even the same sub domain</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:15.679" style="s2">and the reason for that is that google</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">sometimes you you&#39;d get the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.679" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">juice or not google juice</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">the same seo if they&#39;re if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">separate it</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">google in some instances if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">separate sub domains</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not too worried about seo</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t think i ever want people</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:35.120" style="s2">to use the system</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">well at a certain point it will become</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.120" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">so like if it actually gains traction</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:42.320" style="s2">it&#39;ll become something like</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">you know wikipedia or i imdb</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">where google actually says okay give</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">this more</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">more credence right if somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">searching for an actor</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">go ahead and use i i am db</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:56.880" style="s2">right and yeah they have special sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">uh uh parsers for it and stuff but like</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t i&#39;m not really sure what</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">somebody would search for to end up on</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">the site except for someone&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">well yeah they&#39;d search for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">politician&#39;s name yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">so but your reputation based on your</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">blog posts</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">you want that to apply to whether google</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">recommends you also for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">politicians</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:18.799" style="s2">have themselves separate reputations and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">then they&#39;re not combined so</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">they&#39;re each half as likely to be shown</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">up on youtube because a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">the major b2b apps do it that way right</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">like that&#39;s how sales yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">but that&#39;s well yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">they&#39;re taking a hit on their seo yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">likely too and they&#39;re never indexing</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">the app</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">part because that&#39;s all behind you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">very well so that&#39;s the question well</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">you&#39;re right right</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">but see your data i think you do want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">index</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">so yeah if it&#39;s public then it should it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">should be indexed some of these stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">might be member only and then that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s a lot of technical</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">issues to make sure that it&#39;s indexable</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">yeah um i mean the good news is google&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">pretty good at indexing</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">javascript dynamic applications these</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">days but i don&#39;t trust them</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">so i also statically generate the data</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">the google index and for the most part i</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">expect that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">as it starts being used it would start</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">using like you know sort of the true the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">original google thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">the back linking right where people like</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">in twitter posts and on facebook and on</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">their websites and stuff would be like</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">hey check out this profile you know for</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">donald trump and then link that to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">wiki election page</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">you do that you know ten thousand times</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">and all of a sudden google&#39;s like wait</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what i expect will actually end</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">up being the thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:39.600" style="s2">so i think we do need to have you choose</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">a content management</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.600" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">system to use outside of the application</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">and then we also need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">and maybe even get that up and running</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">do that stuff because you you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">anything like that right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">right a wordpress website or anything um</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">i mean the website for what wikilection</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">i think is</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">uh wix and so really</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">like i still sort of uh thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">going to end up being</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:13.039" style="s2">two different sub domains at least to to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2">start with</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.039" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">um if the platform ends up you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">having some sort of integrated cms where</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">i can have a page that is proper ems</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">and there&#39;s a decent way to sort of show</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">that where it&#39;s like hey here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:27.279" style="s2">the web page and all the content that i</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">want to show there and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.279" end="00:30:30.799" style="s2">a deep decent way to say on the flip</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">side here&#39;s all the content that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.799" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">might actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">be here for um</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">regardless regardless of whether on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">sub domain or not doesn&#39;t matter so if</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">you get a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">it would be a headless content</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:47.039" style="s2">management system</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">so you would you would go to a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.039" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">completely different page into the data</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">and then we could serve it up on</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">any domain anywhere i see okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">just need i haven&#39;t played with</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">headless it might be dms</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">yeah so we might choose one i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">to think of the one that i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">we need to worry about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">now because i think for now i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">keep the them separate where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">the the www will be</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">the website and then the app will will</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">be the app</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">if the app thing and when you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">that you&#39;re happy using</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">wix as your cms or whichever right at</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">that point</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">they&#39;re completely divorced so i i if i</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">wanted to use wix or drupal or</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">um the the big one whose name i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.360" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not coming but yeah wordpress there</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">if it&#39;s any of those right because right</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:46.640" style="s2">now i just had to change the sub domain</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">mapping for</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">you know app.collection.com for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">prototype</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">and then tr triple w i change through</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">wix right like i</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">those are two totally separate things if</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">i want to now change</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">who the web hosting is like for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:04.720" style="s2">website i can do that at will and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">and not affect the application so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">so i think the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">we need to do is get a list of features</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">in pr in prioritized order for</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">desirability although</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">we of course may move the order</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">depending upon the speed of development</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">right because if something&#39;s an easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">quick win and it provides value we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">move it up in priority</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">but if we if we just had it in priority</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">order right</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">yeah i can probably do like the one to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:31.039" style="s2">ten</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">priority and the work with you and uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">and radek to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">a one to ten on difficulty and then we</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">can make that chart showing you know hey</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">yeah and then there will be some things</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">that are core if you&#39;re like hey even if</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">this is easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">if we can&#39;t use it until that thing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">done then there&#39;s no point in making it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">until</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">right right yeah and then uh and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">also to have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">flag on there or an indicator whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">are part of the generic rating app or if</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">they&#39;re if it&#39;s unique to wikilection</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">yeah i mean in this case i think the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">writing app it would end up being built</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:07.039" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">like it&#39;s sort of its native place is</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">this app and then we can i mean i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">not sure how early we want to branch it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">like if we want to get it</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">it working and see like okay this is now</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">able to score you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">legislation and people and this and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">here&#39;s how it&#39;s mapping here</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">i would certainly now let&#39;s transplant</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">that to open source world</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got to wait i would i</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:31.039" style="s2">got some stuff i&#39;d like to start using</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">it for in a couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.039" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">right so either we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">you know either i&#39;m gonna rewrite it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.519" style="s2">from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:43.039" style="s2">i mean for my purpose as long as as my</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.519" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">version works</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.039" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">go nuts i yeah that&#39;s what i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:49.519" style="s2">so i just need time to kind of at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">point where</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.519" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">like i&#39;m hoping it can be reused but</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">also if the whole thing like</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s been frozen for way too long</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">now i&#39;m i&#39;m sort of like hey if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">done you know in the next</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">well let&#39;s say five hours just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:03.679" style="s2">worry about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">right we&#39;ll just be starting from from</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.679" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">scratch</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">yeah yeah and that&#39;s the thing is i</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t want to i</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:12.320" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a balance between i</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t want to slow radic down</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">or if or if i help on the wiki lecture</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">side i don&#39;t want to slow that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">development down</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.040" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">so it may just be you know i i</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">i look at radix code and write something</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">that&#39;s compatible</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">and then at some point we could</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">integrate it back in and and use it or</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">um so yeah it&#39;s really kind of having</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">but i think it would be helpful also</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">know kind of like what percentage</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">of wikilection is this rating app</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:47.200" style="s2">because in my mind it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">it&#39;s like 75 but i&#39;ve probably forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">some features that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">like the like depends because</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">it it&#39;s definitely one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">things but</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">without the evidence system it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">useless because it&#39;s just numbers</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">like great you say there are six why</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">should i believe you right um</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:07.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s where like it&#39;s going to end</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">up being very integrated</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.119" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">with that right we&#39;re at the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">level the content</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">section and the the rating system will</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">be really intertwined because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">going to be like this content is saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">this but then it&#39;s proven untrue but</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">then it&#39;s kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">and then it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">interesting to figure out what the end</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">score ended up being after the content</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">is now i also envisioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">envision the ratingsism does have some</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">evidence pieces in it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:36.160" style="s2">basically underneath that i think i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:39.359" style="s2">going to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">reason score um but</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.359" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">one the piece that i don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">needs that his needs is like</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:50.079" style="s2">you had a a rather</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">um high-value</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.079" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">advanced kind of video thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">and that right that would be the level</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">of detail that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">that these this other system wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">um so that i think would be kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">unique feature but the fact of saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:08.800" style="s2">okay i i put this rating and here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">link to the evidence that&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.800" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll also need in there and then that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">evidence could be rated using re</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">reason score pros and cons and debated</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">um yeah because so so another</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">thing that i&#39;m considering which might</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">affect like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">you know if you think that doing the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">the full platform is a good idea or not</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">is drawing up a lot more detailed specs</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:33.920" style="s2">and then using upwork you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">hiring some people in india</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.920" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">or somewhere to sort of build the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">um because then you know it if it takes</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">you know 100 hours or 200 hours like</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot more manageable and then in</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">the end</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">i would hope that there&#39;s you know some</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">rudimentary documentation so either they</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:53.920" style="s2">or somebody else can pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">but with the end goal being that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.920" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">know adding new pages adding new objects</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">doing stuff stuff like that um</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:02.560" style="s2">even if it&#39;s a bit more complex than</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">that is in my day job</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">would still be um faster in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">long run i think now i i do probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">have some time for some paid work the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">problem is that i</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">charge two to three times even at my</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">lowest rates</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">for a product that i believe helps the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">world which of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">uh wikilection falls into that category</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">i still cost to at least two times more</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">than i think you could hire a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">decent dev</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">not the lowest price dev and i&#39;m three</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">times more than</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">kind of the average price and four times</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">more than</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">the cheapest dev which i think are more</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">work than they&#39;re worth</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">um yeah no i i i also</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">might be i might be twice as fast or</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">four times as fast</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">you know i had charged fewer hours just</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">because i know what we&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">everything right</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">so we we might want to think about</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">whether i am</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">a uh efficient use of res</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">funds and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">maybe just having me manage those</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:10.880" style="s2">resources from yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what i was planning it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.880" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">easy you know having somebody that i</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">know and trust</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">sort of help both help manage them and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">help answer questions that i wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:21.599" style="s2">able to right and then like</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">i can talk to either you or radic or</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">whoever and sort of have that back and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">forth right like</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:30.560" style="s2">sort of product manager architect type r</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:31.680" style="s2">r relationship in the software world yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.560" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">we probably need to have a separate</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">meeting</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">and probably that one where we talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">about budgeting what what you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.480" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">afford to invest um although i</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">i still kind of feel bad about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">unless i&#39;m not going to suggest spending</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">any money unless i can</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">see that you will get hit back</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">right and that might be a a a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">right is i can</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">come up sort of with the um</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">the documentation for what i think the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">version should be and it&#39;s probably more</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">realistic to start saying beta if it</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">ends up being a prototype</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">that&#39;s fine um but kind of for it to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">you know even if it starts off as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">prototype that hopefully evolves into a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">beta but like i really don&#39;t expect all</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">of this to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">you know in two or three years if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.720" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">solid and stable and has a big user base</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:27.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t expect there to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">correlation between the two projects if</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.359" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">there is great</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">if not that&#39;s fine too um really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.119" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">just meant to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">you know prove the concept and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;ll help be somewhat agile to prove</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">new concepts</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">but then to hope you know help show</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">people hey here&#39;s what you&#39;d be buying</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">into if you supported us on patreon or</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">wherever yeah and is that is that your</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">kind of initial um</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">funding model is patreon</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:57.920" style="s2">patreon or kickstarter or something like</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">that right like it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.920" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">it well the initial initial funding is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">me and then after that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">it goes into to cr crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s the goal is to where most of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">the money should should come from</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.839" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">like so even a prototype you could start</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">promoting and seeing if right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">i guess the basic goal is i pay for a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">prototype that sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">gets people interested and then that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:26.240" style="s2">gets people interested to start paying</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">in to the organization and then the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">organization you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">pays to build it properly okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">well yeah then then yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">with reddit get your feature list and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">talk about how we can facilitate that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">in the quickest way possible including</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:46.640" style="s2">like you said making it to where you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.280" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">contribute</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.640" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">time to the project more efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">totally yeah and that like you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit easier to sort of add new</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">pages and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">things that i&#39;m used to to doing right</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s and i think that i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">what radic as far as the the rating</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">system like we said and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">probably the base i think radic is</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">already working on making it to where</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">you can add an entity</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">and it&#39;ll create a page for it</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">automatically i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">been working on so he may be partially</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">down that path and maybe now that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:24.000" style="s2">we know that if if if</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">if i&#39;m an efficient use of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">financial resources then you know i can</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">hop in and maybe we can get this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">moving faster</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">right right now do you remember what</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">raddick is using for the back end is i</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:39.119" style="s2">think for the the the front end</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">it&#39;s firebase and i think the front ends</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">react okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">okay and i i&#39;ve that&#39;s my most recent</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:46.880" style="s2">technology stack</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">okay cool now do you know because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.880" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">been doing a bit more research just on</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">the the stacks everything i read was</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">saying like hey for</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">for prototypes ruby on rails keeps</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">coming out</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">no um so what is the difference like as</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">far as like</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.800" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">the wrong thing with the the gems</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s that that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">interesting but i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">firebase you know is and sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:15.119" style="s2">libraries it has</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">but like i you know did a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.119" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">research in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">into what sort of gems are available for</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">root for ruben rails and there were some</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">good good sounding ones right that might</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">make future</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.319" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">parts of the prototype the the problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:29.440" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:31.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know when this when they say</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.440" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2">ruby on rails are they saying ruby on</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.359" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">rails</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">um and then having a react or some sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">of front dinner they talk about ruby on</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:42.000" style="s2">rails and just ruby</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">so when all the reading i did was</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.000" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">talking about using ruby on rails purely</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">as the back end</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll you know in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">separate conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">i did some research on hey what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">the difference between ruby on rails and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:56.079" style="s2">react</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">and the general consensus of a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.079" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">things i i read was</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">okay so they&#39;re not already they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">comparable that rails was</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">the back end and react was the the well</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:07.359" style="s2">ruby</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">that&#39;s my understanding ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.359" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">used to be when it was first created</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:14.560" style="s2">generates the front end html on css and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:16.480" style="s2">sends it to the server so it was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.560" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">completely backend system and had no</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.480" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">dynam</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">dynamic on the front end and you had to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">have a different technology so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.800" end="00:43:25.760" style="s2">now recently</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:27.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve said uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.760" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">they&#39;ve said now just use it as a back</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.680" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">end but</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">your system</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a lot of back end code and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">so what</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">firebase is is it&#39;s a fully built</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a fully built back end it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">no-code back-end basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">right so i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">unless you unless you have some</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:53.440" style="s2">high-level processing on the back end</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:57.119" style="s2">which i don&#39;t think you do</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.440" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">so the the modern process would be to go</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.119" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">basically what&#39;s serverless functions is</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.960" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">is the more thing rather than using um</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">c sharp or ruby on rails to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">and have a back-end server that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">didn&#39;t you&#39;d have to scale</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">right so now now all you do is you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:15.839" style="s2">a database that you&#39;re allowed that has</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">an automated</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:19.359" style="s2">so the ruby on rails is basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:21.119" style="s2">building an api to your database and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.359" end="00:44:25.599" style="s2">it&#39;s very fast for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.119" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">but the firebase database is an api</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">right so we don&#39;t need it&#39;s an extra</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:32.960" style="s2">step to put ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:34.480" style="s2">right here yeah that was the universal</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.960" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">thing that was sort of the con</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.480" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">against ruby on rails was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">performance that was like</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">really the only thing that they said was</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">like yeah the performance compared to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:45.680" style="s2">the other options it isn&#39;t as good</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">um now the part that i&#39;m not sure about</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.680" end="00:44:49.119" style="s2">is like for something like</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">firebase right if you wanted to add like</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.119" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">is there you know just a really easy</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t think that even ruby on</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:55.839" style="s2">rails the term plug-and-play still</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t apply but i&#39;ll use it because i</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.839" end="00:44:58.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">to use yeah what gyms did you hear that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">you thought might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.839" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">okay one second there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">pieces of functionality</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">right um so i i mean they had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">things they were talking about like sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:20.079" style="s2">data display they had a bun like for</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">pagination for categorization for easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.079" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">cloning records soft delete</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:24.359" style="s2">like they have a full list of you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">here&#39;s things for in</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.359" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">internationalization</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">there&#39;s some good testing stuff i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">coders might be interested in some of</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">the stuff where they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">coding style and debugging</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">but one of the the main things is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">looking at things like um</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">the the member sort of creation</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">management backend</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">um at some point there are a few</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">features that will rely</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:50.560" style="s2">on either accepting payments or</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">recurring payments</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.560" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s like a bunch of sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">payment back ends where i&#39;m quite used</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">to working you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">in the the payment cards industry you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:01.119" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">with billing not at like the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.119" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">detailed you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:07.440" style="s2">actually talking to the the gateways</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">but like if there&#39;s a tool that we you</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:10.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">it just says hey you need you know a</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.480" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">gateway in these countries you need</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">this information and then just plug that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">information into the gym and you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">card processing that would be awesome</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">right if it were</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">50 hours instead of 500 hours yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:31.040" style="s2">my concern is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:33.440" style="s2">all of those payment processing backends</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.040" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">have their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.440" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">um javascript apis</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:41.839" style="s2">and if the ruby on rails gems is just a</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">back end and not a front end</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.839" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">then right yeah and that&#39;s i guess</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">one of the key things is like and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">is probably something that i guess</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">like somebody who works in ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">would have more information on but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.640" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">article is i</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">what i was reading they they were sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">using ruby on rails as the back end and</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">a lot of people talked about using react</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">the front end for a ruby on rails back</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">yeah but i think those gems are probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">both fronted back and ruby rails</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">because i don&#39;t it wouldn&#39;t be possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">in and</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">are you looking at the dates of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">articles</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">um this one you might want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">because if they&#39;re over two years old or</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">over a year</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">this one was from january 2020. all</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">why don&#39;t once you gather up a few of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">those uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:33.760" style="s2">and shoot them my way or document them</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:35.280" style="s2">on that spreadsheet and then we can take</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.760" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">a look at them because i</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.280" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">i didn&#39;t even know that people were</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:39.200" style="s2">starting to use ruby on rails is just a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">back end</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.200" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">but honestly i mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t see why you do the extra work</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">firebase has a back end builds the back</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">end for you automatically when you build</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">the database so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:56.800" style="s2">actually that&#39;s a good one second let me</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:58.400" style="s2">go to firebase i&#39;m going to do some</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.800" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">researching how people are currently</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.400" end="00:48:01.520" style="s2">talking about firebase compared to ruby</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">on rails and sort of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.520" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying the differences are</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">uh sorry i remember saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">uh feature list that&#39;s gonna end up</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">being a weird mess because there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">be like things on the platform side and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">the front end and features</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">and that that&#39;s fine this and then write</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">a list of</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">ruby on rails uh gems etc so those are</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">the things i&#39;ll work on so</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">kind of personally i&#39;m going to go do</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:26.000" style="s2">some research on the firebase versus</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">rails just to see what people are saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.000" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">but then for our future conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:32.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll actually list out the features in</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">a spreadsheet you know and do some of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">the basic like sort of how</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">important they are what i figured the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:41.359" style="s2">dependencies are that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll go and make a list of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.359" end="00:48:44.640" style="s2">things that came up in my ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">research that sound interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.640" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">especially as far as</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">existing gems are concerned that like if</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">firebase or something else has an</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:55.599" style="s2">alternative i don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">ruby versus not i just want like a fast</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.599" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">good prototype that&#39;s all i care about</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">yeah so ruby on rails definitely was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:05.440" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">popular prototyping tool</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.440" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">three years ago right but that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">before you have things like fire</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:14.400" style="s2">where you have these dynamic back ends</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">so i like in the first article i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">hitting they say</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">firebase might be less time consuming</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">um right and then they say ruby is</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">simpler</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">um and ruby has a better community</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s not ruby is no longer faster to</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">develop in</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">okay do you know are like i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">if that takes into account the size of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">the prototype like is there</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">you know because with all of the gems if</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">firebase doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">that i wonder if it&#39;s you know sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">rudimentary</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">prototype is faster in firebase but once</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">you hit a certain point maybe it starts</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">to be faster in ruby if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">be you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">using like 10 gems or like yeah at that</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">point it&#39;s probably worth it if you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">it if you aren&#39;t using</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:02.319" style="s2">any gems or one or two it might end up</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:04.559" style="s2">being faster just to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.319" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">use firebase and then do the functions</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">of those</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:10.480" style="s2">but if you&#39;re going to be using 10 or</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">20. okay now we&#39;re in the territory of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">yeah that probably is you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">saving a ton of time there</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:16.079" style="s2">yeah i mean that&#39;s definitely possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:20.319" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.079" end="00:50:24.079" style="s2">uh like when you talk about members</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.319" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">the firebase has a full member system</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.079" end="00:50:29.359" style="s2">built into it right um</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">so i guess we&#39;d have to look to see if</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.359" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">those pieces aren&#39;t already built</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">most stuff like that you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">go to javascript</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">um like they already have an api</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">to those things so</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">we&#39;d have to so yeah if you get a list</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.960" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">of the gems i mean that that definitely</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:49.920" style="s2">would be something to be like</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">oh if we use this gem we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.920" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">write this whole section of the app</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:54.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">totally yeah if we can figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.160" end="00:50:57.359" style="s2">what what those situations are</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">and i guess that&#39;s probably what it will</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.359" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">end up coming down to is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">not just here are the gems that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">sound interesting but like</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">hear the gems that actively sound like</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">they probably should be used</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:10.880" style="s2">um and then some like i guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">where it gets a bit tricky with it is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.880" end="00:51:14.880" style="s2">sounds like some of the gems</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">um i wouldn&#39;t necessarily care about</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.880" end="00:51:17.359" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">you or you know another developer taking</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.359" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">a look at it</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">might say like oh yeah that would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">quite useful um</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">because if this it it is meant to be you</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">a somewhat long-term prototype doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">like some really basic</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">automated testing wouldn&#39;t hurt like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.640" end="00:51:36.480" style="s2">know it&#39;s just to cut</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:37.280" style="s2">the testing loads and i can&#39;t i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.280" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">that they would have a gem that would</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">have better testing than</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">what we have oh really okay because</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">we&#39;re just writing javascript and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">there&#39;s like 50 different javascript</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:50.319" style="s2">automated testing tools</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">uh you know i don&#39;t know i mean go if</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.319" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">you want to list a few of those that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:55.680" style="s2">that&#39;d be fine yeah i&#39;ll i i i might</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">just end up sending you</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">this article first because it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">has that actually yeah i heard one sec</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">i&#39;ll put this in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">chat um</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">because that it&#39;s got them split into i</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know like 15 or 20 sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">sections and then a bunch of gems for</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:15.200" style="s2">each section</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:16.559" style="s2">and some of them i don&#39;t have any skin</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.200" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">in that game right like their testing</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.559" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">coding style</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">debugging some of them you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">get into interesting to me but not</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">directly but i can see that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">important things like authentication</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">security deployment um</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">search is in there like there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">of things which you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:38.160" style="s2">a big part of it is how easy to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.480" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">implement it and do we need all of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.160" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">things that it&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">i understand yeah there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">lot of back and forth but</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:47.200" style="s2">i guess a big part of this is just me</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.800" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">doing the research on firebase</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">versus rails and just seeing what people</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">are saying because if firebase is fine</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">then i mean then it&#39;s probably easier</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">just to stick with it because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.240" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.800" style="s2">there yeah but yeah part of it is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.800" end="00:53:06.160" style="s2">two different languages so</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">uh you know i don&#39;t know if radix would</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:08.880" style="s2">be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:11.040" style="s2">coding that so you&#39;d have you might have</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.880" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">to get a full developer set of new set</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.040" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">of developers</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:16.319" style="s2">that&#39;s usually actually the the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">decision um on what technology to go</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">with is just what</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">your developers know right um but we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:23.359" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.440" end="00:53:24.960" style="s2">and i can see if there&#39;s anything in</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:27.920" style="s2">here i mean there</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.960" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">also in this article if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.920" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">stuck out to you like you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:38.720" style="s2">uh the authentication authorization</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">um i get the admin panel</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:42.559" style="s2">i like from my side the active record</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:45.280" style="s2">thing sounded it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.559" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">sounded interesting partly because i</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">i&#39;m also hoping that in using ruby</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:51.119" style="s2">because it&#39;s sort of meant to be like</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">that really sort of templated you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.119" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">um plug and play back in style then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:53:58.559" style="s2">hoping that some of them might either</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:00.000" style="s2">support this natively or can kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.559" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">re repurposed</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.000" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">to be that platform to sort of say hey</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">use this gem</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:06.720" style="s2">and then all you know all i&#39;ll feed it</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">these values</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">paste on some file and that now tells us</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">how to render the page</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">for people or for you know or</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:17.119" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">that kind of so yeah so like active</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:21.520" style="s2">record is an orm</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:23.680" style="s2">object relational mapper so that&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.520" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">you&#39;re hitting a relational database</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">right firebase is a document store</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:29.599" style="s2">database uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.040" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">and the one of the reasons that our</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.599" end="00:54:33.440" style="s2">document store databases are good is</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">that you don&#39;t need an orm</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.440" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s one of those things where they</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">created active record</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">because we had relational databases but</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not using relational databases</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:43.760" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">so you don&#39;t it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.760" end="00:54:46.000" style="s2">category so</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:47.440" style="s2">what are the ones that you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.000" end="00:54:49.119" style="s2">anymore because when i hear relational</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.440" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">database that sounds like what i</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.119" end="00:54:53.520" style="s2">i would have in mind because a huge part</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">of this is how the records</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.520" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">relate to each other so is the content</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:55:00.559" style="s2">part is that all the same features</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:02.079" style="s2">using right but actually what you talked</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.559" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">about is a graph database not a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.079" end="00:55:06.960" style="s2">relational database</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:10.240" style="s2">okay because the the objects relate to</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.960" end="00:55:10.240" style="s2">each other not the tables</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.640" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">i&#39;m each of those being the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">what&#39;s that well</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">so uh a</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:22.079" style="s2">at a table you say that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.280" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a one-to-many relationship</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">between well actually many many between</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">the legislature</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:35.280" style="s2">from the legislators table and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">um and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.280" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">like between the legislation and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:42.160" style="s2">politicians there&#39;s a many too many</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:43.440" style="s2">relationship in how they voted yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.160" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">so how</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.440" end="00:55:46.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve like documented that is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">three t</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">tables there there&#39;s people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">there&#39;s legislation and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:54.319" style="s2">joint table in the middle called i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.319" end="00:55:57.599" style="s2">voting history that then has a look up</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:55:59.359" style="s2">to both of those</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">right that where it&#39;s got a column for</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:02.240" style="s2">the id of the legislation</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:04.160" style="s2">and i call them for the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.240" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">person and then it says how they voted</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.160" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">and anything else that we we</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.680" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">need to know about the vote so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:11.599" style="s2">the same thing is done in this except</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">it&#39;s just two tables because you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:15.839" style="s2">entity and then you have a table of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">relationships between the entities</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.839" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">although you could do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">relational database how does that work</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">with the tables having different columns</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing is in a in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:30.960" style="s2">in a document database you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">any any object can have any number of</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.960" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">columns and they don&#39;t have to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">the other columns you don&#39;t have to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">a fine</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.359" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">uh defined structure to put data</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">in a collection together okay and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">difference between relational document</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">is that is that a document database is</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.240" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">much more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">okay the problem is wondering if it ends</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2">up being like</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:55.760" style="s2">is it as good for actually like</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:56.480" style="s2">crunching numbers and doing calculations</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.480" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">when those relationships between the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:01.359" style="s2">records in the tables are incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:02.480" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.359" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s going to be a lot of back</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.480" end="00:57:08.799" style="s2">and forth number crunching</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">is okay but doing a dynamic query</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.799" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">among them is a little bit slower in</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">this case but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">necessarily but</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.200" end="00:57:23.440" style="s2">document databases scale a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">than relational databases</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.440" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">so as it gets bigger the document</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">database gets more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">well it&#39;s less less efficient right</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:34.559" style="s2">than a relational database is that like</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.960" end="00:57:36.240" style="s2">talking sort of about having a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">different pages or is that talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:38.839" style="s2">as sort of the database gets more</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:41.200" style="s2">complex because</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.839" end="00:57:43.119" style="s2">this is going to end up being one hell</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.200" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">of a database no it&#39;s not complexity</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.119" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">it&#39;s volume of data as the volume of</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.319" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">data increases</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">the the relational databases become</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s saying both when the number</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">of tables increases and the number of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:57:59.599" style="s2">records</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:01.520" style="s2">it handles both better uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.599" end="00:58:03.760" style="s2">well in in the document database you</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.520" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">don&#39;t have multiple tables</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.760" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">i mean like the the the concept</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">of having more tables right like if if</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">we were having it right there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:14.640" style="s2">realistically there probably end up</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:16.400" style="s2">being over 100 tables when all</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.640" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">is said and done right like if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.400" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">looking at just you know the people</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.000" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">organizations their roles there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:23.520" style="s2">probably going to end up being some</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">stuff underlying that for the content</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.520" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">is going to be legislation you know like</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">things are going to be so</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">interrelated it&#39;s just going to be this</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:35.359" style="s2">spiderweb of a database map</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:35.359" style="s2">if it were a relational database</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">it depends uh mostly that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">not going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:43.359" style="s2">affect either the data systems right</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:43.680" style="s2">because they&#39;re both optimized to handle</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.359" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:47.119" style="s2">i mean unless you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">thousands of tables that&#39;s only the time</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.119" end="00:58:50.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:51.280" style="s2">gets to i don&#39;t think so but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.480" end="00:58:53.680" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.280" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">and like especially not super active</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.680" end="00:58:55.599" style="s2">tables like there might end up being you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">know if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.599" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">if there were a thousand half of them</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.440" end="00:59:00.319" style="s2">would end up being these weird fringe</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">tables that like</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.319" end="00:59:03.760" style="s2">i mean some of them like if we take into</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">account the metadata tables and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.760" end="00:59:07.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">that maybe but yeah so yeah you would</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.520" end="00:59:11.200" style="s2">you would but then you&#39;d restructure how</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">you designed databases you go up in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:17.520" style="s2">abstraction layer so</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">um yeah no i you know um</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.520" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">all the main one the main difference is</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:23.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">is that document databases are much</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.280" end="00:59:26.880" style="s2">faster to do an initial development than</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">than a relational database</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.880" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">right because for a relational database</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">i have to decide what each column has</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">and i have to decide what value</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.839" style="s2">is in a document database i can take any</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:38.000" style="s2">document</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.839" end="00:59:40.160" style="s2">any javascript string and i can just</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.000" end="00:59:43.200" style="s2">throw it in the database</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.160" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">okay so it cuts the development time</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.200" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">significantly right um scales faster but</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:52.079" style="s2">the problem is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:55.359" style="s2">like if you&#39;re running a query that says</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.079" end="00:59:57.839" style="s2">um dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.359" end="01:00:00.480" style="s2">calculations like i want to write a</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.839" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">query that says for all these people</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.480" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">that have the name begin with m and have</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.440" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">a legislation</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:10.319" style="s2">that that has a rating of five</p>
