<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:21.430" style="s2">well Jordan and Dave thank you so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.010" end="00:01:24.100" style="s2">for giving us your time John Anderson</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.430" end="00:01:27.430" style="s2">net is basically dedicated to something</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.100" end="00:01:29.470" style="s2">that is very very dear to me as someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.430" end="00:01:32.440" style="s2">who is very worried about our country</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.470" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">and where we&#39;re going and it&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.440" end="00:01:39.430" style="s2">can it cannot get good public policy</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:41.740" style="s2">without a good public debate and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.430" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">seems now we don&#39;t have debates anymore</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.740" end="00:01:46.990" style="s2">we just have abusive emotional</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:50.710" style="s2">mudslinging so that&#39;s the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.990" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">background theme but then we come to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.710" end="00:01:57.190" style="s2">this incredible opportunity today to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:02:00.460" style="s2">engage with these two gentlemen and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.190" end="00:02:03.070" style="s2">wanted to get the ball rolling by</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.460" end="00:02:05.950" style="s2">talking about a number of issues firstly</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.070" end="00:02:08.860" style="s2">personal responsibility then I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.950" end="00:02:12.280" style="s2">move on to freedom what is it because</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.860" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not licensed it&#39;s not what so many</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.280" end="00:02:16.239" style="s2">people think it is today and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">make it work I then want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.239" end="00:02:21.370" style="s2">courage because we&#39;re going to need a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:23.799" style="s2">lot of it going forward and you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.370" end="00:02:25.720" style="s2">to hear a lot I would see demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.799" end="00:02:27.010" style="s2">some real courage I think here and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.720" end="00:02:28.420" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about in what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.010" end="00:02:31.180" style="s2">going to hear what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.420" end="00:02:33.910" style="s2">witness then a bit about social media</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.180" end="00:02:39.010" style="s2">and how we make it all work and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.910" end="00:02:45.820" style="s2">it&#39;s over to you we live in an age when</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.010" end="00:02:51.850" style="s2">it seems that there&#39;s a crisis of trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.820" end="00:02:55.510" style="s2">in our culture it seems that we are very</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.850" end="00:02:58.630" style="s2">uncertain of our institutions and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.510" end="00:03:05.080" style="s2">people who make them up and what their</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.630" end="00:03:06.910" style="s2">motivations might be and indeed the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.080" end="00:03:08.920" style="s2">research backs that up the Australian</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.910" end="00:03:11.019" style="s2">National University has been tracking</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.920" end="00:03:12.459" style="s2">Australia&#39;s confidence in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.019" end="00:03:16.200" style="s2">politicians and the political process</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.459" end="00:03:19.299" style="s2">now for many decades we are in uncharted</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.200" end="00:03:20.340" style="s2">waters record numbers of Australians no</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.299" end="00:03:22.349" style="s2">longer have con</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:25.230" style="s2">in the system record numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.349" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">Australians now distrust the political</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.230" end="00:03:30.780" style="s2">process and the players in it just more</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">recently we&#39;ve had the latest of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.780" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">series of royal commissions of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:37.370" style="s2">into various institutions this times</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:41.870" style="s2">banking and the financial services and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.370" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">we learnt that we couldn&#39;t trust bankers</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.870" end="00:03:48.120" style="s2">now there are many trustworthy bankers</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.220" end="00:03:49.830" style="s2">in cases are any here but plainly people</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.120" end="00:03:54.380" style="s2">were deeply concerned by what emerged</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.830" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">and you stop and think about this when</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.380" end="00:04:00.360" style="s2">people are in relationships of trust</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:06.420" style="s2">harmony and progress can be made when it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.360" end="00:04:10.019" style="s2">breaks down harmony and progress are</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.420" end="00:04:11.910" style="s2">impaired and people flee for safety if</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.019" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">you don&#39;t feel safe with someone else</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.910" end="00:04:16.049" style="s2">you look for the rule book and you look</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:17.729" style="s2">for policing and you&#39;ll look for</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.049" end="00:04:19.229" style="s2">protection so it&#39;s a good thing we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.729" end="00:04:21.180" style="s2">had the Royal Commission of Inquiry so</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.229" end="00:04:23.390" style="s2">we know what&#39;s been going on it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.180" end="00:04:25.620" style="s2">thing we&#39;ve got the rest 78</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.390" end="00:04:28.680" style="s2">recommendations new laws everywhere new</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:30.390" style="s2">surveillance new policing but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">tragedy it was necessary in the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.390" end="00:04:34.169" style="s2">place that people have not been doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">what they&#39;ve should have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.169" end="00:04:39.240" style="s2">without coercion so now we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:40.650" style="s2">great big battle as to how to resolve</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.240" end="00:04:42.390" style="s2">these things you see the law based</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.650" end="00:04:44.669" style="s2">approach but Jordan you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.390" end="00:04:46.860" style="s2">something quite different in the midst</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.669" end="00:04:49.289" style="s2">of all of us what you have said is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.860" end="00:04:52.710" style="s2">the redemption of the world is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.289" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">political it happens at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.710" end="00:04:56.910" style="s2">individual that&#39;s not what we hear in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:05:00.180" style="s2">the mirror every night there&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.910" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">scandal it&#39;s we need more rules we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.180" end="00:05:04.050" style="s2">more policing we need more surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">we need a different party in power</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.050" end="00:05:08.100" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying that you&#39;re saying it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:12.300" style="s2">comes back to the individual the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.100" end="00:05:14.820" style="s2">question is do you want that I mean do</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.300" end="00:05:17.010" style="s2">you want a more a state with more</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.820" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">regulatory power do you want a state</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.010" end="00:05:22.380" style="s2">with more surveillance I mean first of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:24.210" style="s2">all why would you think that that would</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.380" end="00:05:26.220" style="s2">be trustworthy when all the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.210" end="00:05:28.139" style="s2">suggests in the past that as a state</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">expands its surveillance power it</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.139" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">actually becomes less trustworthy rather</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">than more and why would you want you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:36.180" style="s2">might think well ice</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:38.789" style="s2">certainly want someone looking into your</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.180" end="00:05:40.860" style="s2">affairs but I don&#39;t want anybody looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.789" end="00:05:42.900" style="s2">into mine well good luck with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:45.539" style="s2">because you know to the degree that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.900" end="00:05:47.160" style="s2">have someone elect someone to look into</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.539" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">your affairs their bloody well going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.160" end="00:05:51.300" style="s2">be looking into mine as well and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:54.690" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t strike me as a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.300" end="00:05:56.100" style="s2">positive development and practically</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.690" end="00:05:57.900" style="s2">because I don&#39;t believe it&#39;ll work I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.100" end="00:05:59.699" style="s2">don&#39;t think surveillance states do make</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.900" end="00:06:02.430" style="s2">people more honest I think all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.699" end="00:06:04.110" style="s2">evidence is the opposite and then I</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:08.340" style="s2">would say from the individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.110" end="00:06:11.430" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s like I believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.340" end="00:06:14.220" style="s2">the fundamental what we got</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.430" end="00:06:15.630" style="s2">fundamentally right in the West because</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.220" end="00:06:17.340" style="s2">there is a number of things we got</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.630" end="00:06:20.099" style="s2">fundamentally right even though we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.340" end="00:06:23.880" style="s2">like to admit that anymore is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.099" end="00:06:29.970" style="s2">ultimate moral responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.880" end="00:06:32.340" style="s2">state relies on you it relies on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.970" end="00:06:35.479" style="s2">moral integrity and you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.340" end="00:06:38.849" style="s2">it&#39;s not that hard to think that through</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.479" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like well first of all you have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.849" end="00:06:43.409" style="s2">right and the responsibility to vote and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:46.380" style="s2">we could say well that&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.409" end="00:06:48.570" style="s2">given to you by the state it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.380" end="00:06:51.389" style="s2">something that exists in some in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.570" end="00:06:53.580" style="s2">sense outside and before the state it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.389" end="00:06:55.470" style="s2">part and parcel of your intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.580" end="00:06:57.169" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s a decision that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.470" end="00:06:59.220" style="s2">made in the West that each person</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.169" end="00:07:02.280" style="s2">regardless of their flaws is</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.220" end="00:07:04.159" style="s2">characterized by a value an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:08.159" style="s2">value that&#39;s so deep and so profound</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.159" end="00:07:10.740" style="s2">that the very regulation of the state</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.159" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">itself rests on their shoulders and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.740" end="00:07:14.659" style="s2">that&#39;s really something that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:17.880" style="s2">why you have the right to vote and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.659" end="00:07:20.340" style="s2">that&#39;s worth thinking about the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.880" end="00:07:22.530" style="s2">question is well do you think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.340" end="00:07:25.169" style="s2">good idea or not I do you believe that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.530" end="00:07:28.199" style="s2">we are in fact sovereign individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.169" end="00:07:31.050" style="s2">then well let&#39;s assume that you believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.199" end="00:07:32.940" style="s2">that we are because the alternative is</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:34.949" style="s2">some sort of autocracy right it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.940" end="00:07:36.930" style="s2">sort of tyranny it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.949" end="00:07:39.720" style="s2">parsing off of that sovereignty to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.930" end="00:07:41.340" style="s2">bureaucracy or to some arbitrary form of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.720" end="00:07:42.870" style="s2">leadership and maybe you can believe in</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.340" end="00:07:45.029" style="s2">that and you&#39;d like a strong leader and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.870" end="00:07:47.330" style="s2">fine but you you want to think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.029" end="00:07:50.659" style="s2">through because if if it&#39;s not that then</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.330" end="00:07:52.370" style="s2">you well then it&#39;s if it&#39;s you and you</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.459" end="00:09:44.589" style="s2">first price that you pay for it is well</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.500" end="00:09:46.579" style="s2">there goes the adventure of your life</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.589" end="00:09:48.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like you could get yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.579" end="00:09:51.380" style="s2">together and be the bedrock of the state</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.920" end="00:09:53.180" style="s2">right that&#39;d be hard that call on</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.370" end="00:09:59.000" style="s2">off to someone else and then then what</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">do you do you&#39;ve got nothing left in</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.000" end="00:10:03.089" style="s2">your life a triviality and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:07.670" style="s2">you can&#39;t live I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.089" end="00:10:10.050" style="s2">people can live ethically trivially</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.670" end="00:10:12.290" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think the pursuit of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.050" end="00:10:15.089" style="s2">idea that life is for happiness is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.290" end="00:10:17.310" style="s2">because life is too difficult for that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.089" end="00:10:20.820" style="s2">to be the case our lives are too</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.930" end="00:10:32.250" style="s2">for happiness to be the proper solution</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.709" end="00:10:34.560" style="s2">the solution is something like a heavy</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.250" end="00:10:37.589" style="s2">burden of ethical responsibility the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:40.529" style="s2">kind that sets the state straight and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.589" end="00:10:43.290" style="s2">then in that you find the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.529" end="00:10:46.260" style="s2">your life and so not only if you want</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.290" end="00:10:47.820" style="s2">the external monitoring and the</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.980" end="00:11:04.440" style="s2">someone takes it from you they take your</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.899" end="00:11:07.410" style="s2">destiny from you and that&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.440" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">live that&#39;s just that&#39;s the tyranny that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:13.620" style="s2">we&#39;ve struggled against in the West</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:16.050" style="s2">successfully for I would say in one way</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.620" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">or another for for for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.050" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">thousands of years and with a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:23.550" style="s2">substantial amount of success to draw</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:25.890" style="s2">dive into this we met in LA a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.550" end="00:11:27.810" style="s2">years ago over breakfast Dave you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.890" end="00:11:30.690" style="s2">great defender of culture too now when</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.810" end="00:11:33.410" style="s2">we met it was very interesting you set</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.690" end="00:11:37.110" style="s2">out the reasons in a way for me to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.410" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">he&#39;s a card-carrying progressive you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.110" end="00:11:40.440" style="s2">know you tell me where you came from and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:43.380" style="s2">what do you believe in what you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.440" end="00:11:46.589" style="s2">and then you said and I&#39;m gay married</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.380" end="00:11:48.660" style="s2">man and then he went on to say and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.589" end="00:11:52.019" style="s2">thank God every day I live in Christian</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.660" end="00:11:54.089" style="s2">America and I thought that&#39;s a surprise</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.019" end="00:11:56.089" style="s2">turn in the conversation and we had a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.089" end="00:11:59.130" style="s2">fantastic breakfast talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.089" end="00:12:00.779" style="s2">you&#39;re a defender of culture now or of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.130" end="00:12:03.180" style="s2">our cultural roots at a time when the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.779" end="00:12:05.160" style="s2">West seems to be its own worst enemy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.180" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t believe in its cultural roots</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.160" end="00:12:09.060" style="s2">can you elaborate yeah of course well</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:11.130" style="s2">you know first off as you guys I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.060" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">know Jordan I just left the Sydney Opera</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.130" end="00:12:14.519" style="s2">House a few minutes ago and we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:15.270" style="s2">about a hundred and twenty some odd</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.519" end="00:12:17.310" style="s2">shows</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.270" end="00:12:19.380" style="s2">opened for Jordan and it just struck me</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.310" end="00:12:24.420" style="s2">in the last two minutes that having to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.380" end="00:12:26.520" style="s2">follow you is much less fun but having</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.420" end="00:12:28.050" style="s2">to go before you that&#39;s easy I&#39;m usually</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.520" end="00:12:30.260" style="s2">just setting them up and you&#39;re knocking</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.050" end="00:12:32.550" style="s2">them out of the park but ok I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.260" end="00:12:33.840" style="s2">well just quickly on what Jordan said</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.550" end="00:12:35.670" style="s2">about the individual because it links</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.840" end="00:12:38.220" style="s2">exactly to that you know people ask me</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.670" end="00:12:40.260" style="s2">all the time in the QAS and in our meet</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.220" end="00:12:43.100" style="s2">and greets what what is going on why is</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.260" end="00:12:45.150" style="s2">it that people are following this</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.100" end="00:12:48.600" style="s2">psychologist talking about lobsters all</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.150" end="00:12:50.910" style="s2">over the country and and actually that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.600" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">question is what I believe is the answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.910" end="00:12:57.390" style="s2">there is there has been a complete</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:59.940" style="s2">obliteration for young people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.390" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">understand what being an individual it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.940" end="00:13:05.610" style="s2">is what being a person that owns your</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:06.900" style="s2">own mind that decides to get out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.610" end="00:13:08.580" style="s2">and live the life they&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.900" end="00:13:10.590" style="s2">live that doesn&#39;t want to take from</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.580" end="00:13:12.630" style="s2">somebody and give to somebody else or</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.590" end="00:13:14.820" style="s2">just take for themselves and that has</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.630" end="00:13:16.380" style="s2">really been lost and what&#39;s been amazing</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.820" end="00:13:18.900" style="s2">to me as we&#39;ve done now 20-some odd</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.380" end="00:13:20.640" style="s2">countries is that the same things that</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:34.890" style="s2">fascinating so to your question because</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.650" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">I am an individual that is what led me</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.890" end="00:13:38.670" style="s2">here that that&#39;s I think what led you to</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:30.610" style="s2">add this that Douglas Mari who I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.490" end="00:15:32.649" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with in the UK he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.610" end="00:15:34.120" style="s2">gay and I and he&#39;s a brilliant thinker</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.649" end="00:15:35.860" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t even want to ask him</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.120" end="00:15:37.510" style="s2">anything about that because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.860" end="00:15:39.100" style="s2">completely irrelevant in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.510" end="00:15:41.020" style="s2">but the last question when I had him on</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.100" end="00:15:44.649" style="s2">last time I said to him do you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.020" end="00:15:47.760" style="s2">your sexuality has a little something to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.649" end="00:15:50.649" style="s2">do with your sensitivity about freedom</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.760" end="00:15:54.130" style="s2">because you know it might be you first</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.649" end="00:15:56.440" style="s2">and he said that he thought his skin was</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.130" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">a little thinner because of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.440" end="00:16:01.000" style="s2">I do think that people that are on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:02.410" style="s2">outside for whatever whatever that is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.000" end="00:16:04.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be sexuality it could be</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.410" end="00:16:06.490" style="s2">obviously a myriad of different issues</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.870" end="00:16:08.829" style="s2">I do think you become a little more</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.490" end="00:16:11.980" style="s2">sensitive sensitive to it and for that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.829" end="00:16:13.810" style="s2">reason I&#39;m incredibly I&#39;ll go a step</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.980" end="00:16:15.970" style="s2">further I am blessed that I live in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.980" end="00:16:31.570" style="s2">that and yet half a time when you listen</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.529" end="00:16:34.510" style="s2">to the elites who have their hands on</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.450" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">probably busted up physically and on all</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.670" end="00:17:52.360" style="s2">sorts of other ways as well when that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.650" end="00:17:55.030" style="s2">photograph was taken he was a hero in</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.020" end="00:18:16.510" style="s2">this is a remarkable book he wrote about</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.730" end="00:18:34.570" style="s2">wrote a great essay on it over Christmas</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:32.590" style="s2">rather he said the dividing line between</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.769" end="00:19:34.299" style="s2">good and evil lies somewhere across</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.379" end="00:20:45.879" style="s2">freed found his way to America the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.929" end="00:20:47.649" style="s2">Americans and the West refused to listen</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.879" end="00:20:49.450" style="s2">to his warnings he was there like a kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.649" end="00:20:53.019" style="s2">of prophet saying look out you&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.450" end="00:20:55.659" style="s2">your freedoms what did he mean how do</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.019" end="00:20:57.190" style="s2">you find freedom when it&#39;s not physical</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.659" end="00:20:59.950" style="s2">you can&#39;t move you&#39;re in fear of your</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.190" end="00:21:01.570" style="s2">life but in some other way he found</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.950" end="00:21:05.519" style="s2">freedom what&#39;s it mean can we unpack</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.570" end="00:21:05.519" style="s2">that because I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.669" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">well one of the things that Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.010" end="00:21:15.740" style="s2">did and this is something I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:17.299" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.740" end="00:21:20.679" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve thought about it for decades</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.299" end="00:21:23.059" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a remarkable story I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.679" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">think he tells it in the second volume</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.059" end="00:21:28.490" style="s2">of The Gulag Archipelago because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.220" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">three volume book the full book and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.490" end="00:21:32.870" style="s2">all worth reading especially the second</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:36.460" style="s2">volume and especially the second half</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.870" end="00:21:38.570" style="s2">and in that he details his</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.460" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">transformation I would say his</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.570" end="00:21:44.630" style="s2">psychological or spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:46.760" style="s2">transformation know he was on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.630" end="00:21:50.179" style="s2">Russian front which was not a pleasant</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.760" end="00:21:53.270" style="s2">place to be because Stalin had signed a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.179" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">pact with Hitler and Hitler broke it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.270" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">the Russians were completely unprepared</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:59.630" style="s2">and so to be on the Russian front at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:02.750" style="s2">beginning of World War two was a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.630" end="00:22:04.789" style="s2">bad place to be and he wrote letters to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.750" end="00:22:06.470" style="s2">a competitor to his complaining about</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.789" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">the lack of preparation and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.470" end="00:22:11.720" style="s2">got him thrown in the camps now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.770" end="00:22:15.890" style="s2">interesting to note that Stalin threw</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.720" end="00:22:18.200" style="s2">all of the Soviet prisoners of war into</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.890" end="00:22:19.610" style="s2">camps so if you were a Soviet soldier</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.200" end="00:22:22.010" style="s2">and you would go on to the West and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.610" end="00:22:23.870" style="s2">fought and you were captured and put in</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.010" end="00:22:26.450" style="s2">a say a German prisoner of war camp and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.870" end="00:22:30.049" style="s2">treated terribly because Stalin didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.450" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">sign the agreement it was from</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.049" end="00:22:34.279" style="s2">Switzerland Geneva Geneva Accords on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:36.020" style="s2">treatment of prisoners of war and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.279" end="00:22:38.750" style="s2">Russians were treated so badly that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.020" end="00:22:41.649" style="s2">Allies used to feed them you know and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.750" end="00:22:45.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they were not hungry and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.649" end="00:22:46.760" style="s2">so you would end up in a powa amp there</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.080" end="00:22:48.919" style="s2">and then when you were done with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.760" end="00:22:50.870" style="s2">when you went home to Russia for your</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.919" end="00:22:53.419" style="s2">hero&#39;s welcome you were thrown into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.870" end="00:22:55.700" style="s2">goo leg because Stalin believed that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.419" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">mere fact that you&#39;d been exposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.700" end="00:23:00.770" style="s2">West now made you a class enemy so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">was the sort of place the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.770" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">was now Seoul jannat to spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:08.510" style="s2">time in the gulag and he observed that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:11.419" style="s2">there were people there who he admired</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.510" end="00:23:15.260" style="s2">now the camps were mostly run by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.419" end="00:23:17.210" style="s2">prisoners so because most prisoners many</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.260" end="00:23:18.770" style="s2">prisoners became trustees and then would</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.210" end="00:23:20.210" style="s2">move up the administrative ladder and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.770" end="00:23:21.950" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty interesting and it really</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.210" end="00:23:24.200" style="s2">dark way right because it&#39;s like a hell</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.950" end="00:23:25.700" style="s2">that&#39;s run by the Devils and they could</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.200" end="00:23:27.530" style="s2">escape at any moment if they just</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.700" end="00:23:31.880" style="s2">realized that they were the ones running</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.530" end="00:23:33.470" style="s2">it but they didn&#39;t and so and and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.880" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">that that made the situation even more</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.470" end="00:23:36.680" style="s2">brutal than it might have been because</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:39.500" style="s2">he noticed too that prisoners who became</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.680" end="00:23:41.960" style="s2">guards were often more brutal than the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.500" end="00:23:44.090" style="s2">civilian guards maybe to justify to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.960" end="00:23:46.450" style="s2">themselves what they had done who knows</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.090" end="00:23:48.410" style="s2">anyways Solzhenitsyn at one point</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.450" end="00:23:51.800" style="s2">noticed that there were people in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.410" end="00:23:55.030" style="s2">camps whose comportment he truly admired</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.800" end="00:23:58.660" style="s2">who seemed incorruptible who wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.030" end="00:24:00.980" style="s2">deceive or lie or take the easy way out</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.660" end="00:24:03.470" style="s2">regardless of what it was that they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.980" end="00:24:05.630" style="s2">being threatened with and they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.470" end="00:24:07.790" style="s2">sign the confessions that everybody had</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.630" end="00:24:10.040" style="s2">to sign guilty or not guilty</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.790" end="00:24:12.260" style="s2">they refused to play along and some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.040" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">them certainly died for that but many</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.260" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">people died in the gulags so that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:21.080" style="s2">hardly an anomaly but he said that many</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:23.780" style="s2">of them many of the people who ran the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.080" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">camps were terrified by these people and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.780" end="00:24:27.230" style="s2">that also that many of them were</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">religious believers which was quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.230" end="00:24:31.670" style="s2">interesting and so what he learned was</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:35.270" style="s2">that even under terrible circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.670" end="00:24:39.710" style="s2">there were ways of being more or less</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.270" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">noble and I suppose it would be under</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.710" end="00:24:42.860" style="s2">terrible circumstances where that sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:46.100" style="s2">of thing would be put to the test and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.860" end="00:24:49.670" style="s2">and it really made him think about his</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.100" end="00:24:52.070" style="s2">own role in his own demise</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.670" end="00:24:54.500" style="s2">you know like he had Hitler to blame</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.070" end="00:24:56.630" style="s2">right because well there was the Second</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.500" end="00:25:00.140" style="s2">World War and he had Stalin to blame and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.630" end="00:25:00.950" style="s2">I mean if you need people to blame for</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.140" end="00:25:03.950" style="s2">your misery</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.950" end="00:25:06.500" style="s2">those are credible people to blame you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.950" end="00:25:09.650" style="s2">know especially both of them at the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.500" end="00:25:12.560" style="s2">time and yet he started to consider you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.650" end="00:25:15.350" style="s2">know what did I do in my own life that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.560" end="00:25:17.990" style="s2">increase the probability that I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.350" end="00:25:19.940" style="s2">here you know as a citizen for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.990" end="00:25:21.710" style="s2">who was responsible for the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.940" end="00:25:24.140" style="s2">country operated because you know like</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.710" end="00:25:26.800" style="s2">in East Germany one third of the people</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.140" end="00:25:29.210" style="s2">in East Germany were informers and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.800" end="00:25:31.880" style="s2">everybody in the Soviet system lied</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.210" end="00:25:33.500" style="s2">about everything to everyone all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.880" end="00:25:33.830" style="s2">time which is of course what you would</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.500" end="00:25:35.419" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.830" end="00:25:36.980" style="s2">one in three people were informers</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.419" end="00:25:39.289" style="s2">because that would be like two people in</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.980" end="00:25:41.840" style="s2">your family and so the whole system was</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.289" end="00:25:45.259" style="s2">set up and maintained because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:47.629" style="s2">lied you think well if I stop lying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.259" end="00:25:50.570" style="s2">done for it&#39;s like yeah fair enough man</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.629" end="00:25:51.590" style="s2">but if you keep lying and so does</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.570" end="00:25:54.590" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.590" end="00:25:56.629" style="s2">you&#39;re also done for and so is everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.590" end="00:25:59.029" style="s2">else so that doesn&#39;t seem to be much of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.629" end="00:26:00.379" style="s2">an option and Solzhenitsyn noted that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.029" end="00:26:02.119" style="s2">there were people even under these</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.379" end="00:26:03.860" style="s2">extreme circumstances that would tell</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.119" end="00:26:06.440" style="s2">the truth and he decided that he would</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.860" end="00:26:09.529" style="s2">go over his life with a fine-tooth comb</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.440" end="00:26:12.350" style="s2">he had nothing but time to think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.529" end="00:26:15.259" style="s2">every time he had acted in some manner</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.350" end="00:26:16.399" style="s2">in his life that transgressed against</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.259" end="00:26:17.840" style="s2">his own conscience</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.399" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">right that where he did something he</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:22.609" style="s2">knew to be wrong and then to see if he</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">could figure out how to set it right</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.609" end="00:26:26.509" style="s2">then now obviously he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:28.730" style="s2">necessarily apologize to the people</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.509" end="00:26:30.859" style="s2">against who he had transgressed right</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.730" end="00:26:33.470" style="s2">sometimes you have to pay for something</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.859" end="00:26:37.609" style="s2">you did in a currency other than that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.470" end="00:26:40.789" style="s2">which you took and his determination was</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.609" end="00:26:42.889" style="s2">to chronicle his experiences in his</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.789" end="00:26:44.629" style="s2">truthful manner as possible which was</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.889" end="00:26:48.350" style="s2">basically impossible it wasn&#39;t like he</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.629" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">had paper and pencil and and time to</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.350" end="00:26:52.460" style="s2">write and privacy had his notebooks ever</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.019" style="s2">being discovered well he would have been</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.460" end="00:26:56.210" style="s2">in serious trouble and they would have</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.019" end="00:26:58.730" style="s2">been destroyed in fact when he got out</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.210" end="00:27:01.700" style="s2">he had two copies of the full manuscript</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.730" end="00:27:04.669" style="s2">each out to a different typist secretly</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.700" end="00:27:07.129" style="s2">the KGB got a hold of one destroyed it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.669" end="00:27:10.190" style="s2">and the typist committed suicide you</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.830" end="00:31:22.940" style="s2">the reason for that is that you actually</p>

<p begin="00:31:22.940" end="00:31:26.659" style="s2">finish that with one thing there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.740" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">a very interesting scene in Revelations</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.659" end="00:31:32.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a very strange document appended</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:34.100" style="s2">to the end of the primary book in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.150" end="00:31:37.400" style="s2">Western Canon right and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.100" end="00:31:40.039" style="s2">hallucinogenic nightmare revelation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.400" end="00:31:42.260" style="s2">in it Christ comes back to earth and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.039" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">he&#39;s not the merciful Savior of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.260" end="00:31:45.559" style="s2">Gospels he&#39;s the judge and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:47.480" style="s2">reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.559" end="00:31:50.049" style="s2">a psychological reason and the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.480" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">is that if you have an ideal and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.049" end="00:31:56.750" style="s2">whatever Christ is metaphysically or</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:58.850" style="s2">psychologically he&#39;s an ideal if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.750" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">have an ideal and ideal is a judge</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.850" end="00:32:03.890" style="s2">because the ideal judges you right okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:06.169" style="s2">so he comes back as a judge he has a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.890" end="00:32:08.659" style="s2">sword in his mouth and he judges that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.169" end="00:32:09.159" style="s2">saved in the and the Damned and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.659" end="00:32:11.750" style="s2">pretty</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.159" end="00:32:14.570" style="s2">but here&#39;s something interesting it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.750" end="00:32:18.049" style="s2">fascinating he saves his</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.570" end="00:32:20.330" style="s2">worse contempt and and uses contemptuous</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.049" end="00:32:21.950" style="s2">language says I will spit you out of my</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.330" end="00:32:24.440" style="s2">mouth it really means I will vomit you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.950" end="00:32:27.620" style="s2">out of my mouth not if you were a bad</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.440" end="00:32:29.419" style="s2">person not if you were a good person not</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.620" end="00:32:31.940" style="s2">if you were a bad person but if you sat</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.419" end="00:32:34.190" style="s2">on the bloody fence right if you were</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.940" end="00:32:35.179" style="s2">neither warm nor cold you wanted to play</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.190" end="00:32:37.549" style="s2">it both ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.179" end="00:32:39.259" style="s2">well I&#39;ll lie when it&#39;s in my favor and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.549" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell the truth when it&#39;s expedient</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.259" end="00:32:43.700" style="s2">for me it&#39;s like you&#39;re you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:45.320" style="s2">category of the damned and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.700" end="00:32:47.629" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely right because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.320" end="00:32:50.179" style="s2">real cowardice if you believed in</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.629" end="00:32:52.730" style="s2">falsehood it&#39;s like good get on with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.179" end="00:32:54.919" style="s2">man you could be a criminal and lay your</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.730" end="00:32:56.539" style="s2">life out and see how that works and if</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.919" end="00:32:58.519" style="s2">you believe in truth well then perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.539" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">you put yourself on the line for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.519" end="00:33:03.409" style="s2">truth but you don&#39;t play the the two</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:07.179" style="s2">sides against the middle because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.409" end="00:33:07.179" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in that that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.570" end="00:33:11.929" style="s2">self-serving at the cost of your own</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.500" end="00:34:24.740" style="s2">and believing that the projects are</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.329" end="00:34:26.419" style="s2">corrupt and that the leadership isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.740" end="00:34:28.429" style="s2">doing what it&#39;s supposed to they start</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.429" end="00:34:31.819" style="s2">you mean you&#39;re actually willing to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.319" end="00:34:33.799" style="s2">admit that that is the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.819" end="00:34:35.929" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna give me a problem that is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.799" end="00:34:38.210" style="s2">real problem that I could actually work</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.929" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">on and actually solve and benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.210" end="00:34:43.730" style="s2">that and the whole company switches</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:47.059" style="s2">around and and if that works it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.730" end="00:34:49.220" style="s2">naive to believe that and I&#39;ll say one</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.059" end="00:34:51.889" style="s2">more thing about trust that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.220" end="00:34:55.549" style="s2">worth knowing so this is what you learn</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.889" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re a clinician most people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.549" end="00:35:03.559" style="s2">trust are naive and naive is not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:05.569" style="s2">virtue it&#39;s a fault it&#39;s partly a fault</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.559" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">because if you&#39;re naive and you run into</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.569" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">someone who&#39;s malevolent including you</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:12.680" style="s2">they might do you incalculable damage so</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:14.809" style="s2">that you will never recover</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.680" end="00:35:17.299" style="s2">so that&#39;s not a good thing you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.809" end="00:35:18.920" style="s2">want to be naive if you&#39;re not naive</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.299" end="00:35:20.839" style="s2">that means you&#39;ve been burned once or</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.920" end="00:35:22.640" style="s2">twice or three or four times and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.839" end="00:35:24.140" style="s2">know once you&#39;ve been burned in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.640" end="00:35:26.539" style="s2">manner well then it&#39;s hard to trust</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.140" end="00:35:28.700" style="s2">because you think well why would I trust</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.539" end="00:35:31.190" style="s2">you or me for that matter knowing full</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.700" end="00:35:33.170" style="s2">well that I can be betrayed and so then</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.190" end="00:35:34.910" style="s2">you&#39;re cynical and you think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.170" end="00:35:37.910" style="s2">improvement over being naive</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.910" end="00:35:39.529" style="s2">you know it&#39;s you&#39;re more mature cynical</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.910" end="00:35:41.390" style="s2">than you are naive even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.529" end="00:35:43.099" style="s2">premature and it&#39;s often premature in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.390" end="00:35:45.170" style="s2">young people it&#39;s like okay so how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.099" end="00:35:48.950" style="s2">you get out of that conundrum well this</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.170" end="00:35:51.980" style="s2">is a crucial thing to know you trust</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.950" end="00:35:53.930" style="s2">people because you&#39;re courageous that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.980" end="00:35:57.349" style="s2">why it&#39;s the same reason that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.930" end="00:35:59.210" style="s2">grateful it&#39;s a mark of courage it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.349" end="00:36:00.859" style="s2">mark of commitment it&#39;s like you and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.210" end="00:36:02.930" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna make an agreement and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.859" end="00:36:05.059" style="s2">full of snakes and so am i and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.930" end="00:36:06.680" style="s2">lots of ways this can go sideways but</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.059" end="00:36:08.180" style="s2">we&#39;re going to put together an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.680" end="00:36:09.859" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna articulate it out we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.180" end="00:36:11.900" style="s2">gonna try to find something that is of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.859" end="00:36:13.579" style="s2">mutual benefit to both of us we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.900" end="00:36:15.799" style="s2">put our hands out and shake and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.579" end="00:36:18.680" style="s2">gonna try to stick to that and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.799" end="00:36:21.230" style="s2">gonna risk trusting each other right</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.680" end="00:36:23.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a risk and that&#39;s the risk upon</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.230" end="00:36:25.369" style="s2">which the state is based really like I</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.720" end="00:36:27.230" style="s2">believe and I think the evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.369" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">this is very strong by the way I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.230" end="00:36:32.599" style="s2">think that there is any other natural</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:35.630" style="s2">resource than trust and for trust you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.599" end="00:36:37.880" style="s2">need courage not naivety and you go to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.630" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">overcome your cynicism so that you trust</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.880" end="00:36:42.299" style="s2">and then you ask yourself to if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:47.339" style="s2">don&#39;t trust your institutions it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.299" end="00:36:48.719" style="s2">hey there your institutions why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.339" end="00:36:50.519" style="s2">you go out and do something about them</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.719" end="00:36:53.130" style="s2">you think well I can&#39;t it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.519" end="00:36:55.819" style="s2">not true that is that is absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.130" end="00:36:58.679" style="s2">true that that&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.819" end="00:37:00.809" style="s2">vaguely accurate about that in a society</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.679" end="00:37:04.049" style="s2">like this almost all of our democratic</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.809" end="00:37:06.900" style="s2">institutions are crying out for people</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.049" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">to participate they can&#39;t find enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.900" end="00:37:11.880" style="s2">people to do it and if you participate</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:14.339" style="s2">and you and and you do it diligently and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.880" end="00:37:16.799" style="s2">you have your say and you&#39;re careful and</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.339" end="00:37:18.839" style="s2">trustworthy and you and you and you and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.799" end="00:37:22.289" style="s2">you and you speak your mind you can have</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.839" end="00:37:24.479" style="s2">way more effect than you think so if</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.289" end="00:37:26.849" style="s2">you&#39;re cynical about the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.479" end="00:37:29.189" style="s2">it&#39;s like look in the mirror because</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.849" end="00:37:30.749" style="s2">those institutions the corruption of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.189" end="00:37:33.449" style="s2">those institutions is a direct</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.749" end="00:37:35.459" style="s2">reflection of your inability to get your</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.429" end="00:37:44.699" style="s2">community so it&#39;s not someone else so</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:46.619" style="s2">this issue of trust now I would have</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.699" end="00:37:51.900" style="s2">thought that after what he&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.619" end="00:37:53.819" style="s2">through and you&#39;ve outlined it not a</p>

<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:03.719" style="s2">responsible and a heed history salt</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.589" end="00:38:05.910" style="s2">solution is a classic example what has</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.719" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">happened you made the point that for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.910" end="00:38:12.449" style="s2">very long time we understood how</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:15.359" style="s2">dangerous that sort of drift towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.449" end="00:38:18.150" style="s2">totalitarianism is it seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">washed out of the system now it seems as</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.380" end="00:38:29.670" style="s2">worries me about that is the old saying</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.789" end="00:38:43.619" style="s2">the consequences well it was an</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.869" end="00:39:31.560" style="s2">I go to college campuses is that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.060" end="00:39:33.150" style="s2">know these kids will protest and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.560" end="00:39:35.970" style="s2">scream and that you know that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.150" end="00:39:38.220" style="s2">alright and everyone&#39;s neo-nazi and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.970" end="00:39:39.720" style="s2">rest of this and I I always find alright</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.220" end="00:39:40.950" style="s2">well how do you how do you break through</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.720" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">to somebody like that how do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.950" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">actually when they have you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:46.410" style="s2">talked about this when they have that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:49.050" style="s2">look in their eye truly a possessed look</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.410" end="00:39:51.480" style="s2">and and they&#39;re you know it&#39;s this this</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.050" end="00:39:54.090" style="s2">postmodern monster has become sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.480" end="00:39:55.470" style="s2">secular religion and I think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.090" end="00:39:57.119" style="s2">one of the reasons why what Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.470" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">doing is resonating because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.119" end="00:40:00.869" style="s2">they&#39;ve removed religion from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:02.580" style="s2">equation and now they have no meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.869" end="00:40:06.869" style="s2">and they put it all into this really</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.580" end="00:40:08.609" style="s2">competing set of ideas where we call the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.869" end="00:40:10.410" style="s2">the oppression Olympics where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.609" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">constantly competing for oppression</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.410" end="00:40:13.980" style="s2">because they believe that victimhood is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:15.810" style="s2">virtue and victimhood of course is not</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.980" end="00:40:16.980" style="s2">virtue what&#39;s virtuous is getting your</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.810" end="00:40:18.390" style="s2">life in order and going out and doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.980" end="00:40:20.730" style="s2">something so I&#39;m always looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.390" end="00:40:22.140" style="s2">little trick to get through to these</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.730" end="00:40:23.490" style="s2">kids and it&#39;s really hard because when</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.140" end="00:40:26.099" style="s2">they have that sort of glossed over</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.490" end="00:40:28.619" style="s2">zombie look it&#39;s it&#39;s tough and I found</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.099" end="00:40:30.690" style="s2">one trick that actually kind of works if</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.619" end="00:40:32.790" style="s2">you can get it to them in the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.690" end="00:40:34.140" style="s2">simple personal way and this</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.790" end="00:40:35.160" style="s2">particularly works in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.140" end="00:40:37.380" style="s2">and I have no doubt that it would work</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.160" end="00:40:40.290" style="s2">here in Australia as well I&#39;ll say to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.380" end="00:40:42.359" style="s2">them anyone in this room does anyone in</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.290" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">this room have it worse than their</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.359" end="00:40:46.980" style="s2">grandparents now I&#39;ve done this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:47.849" style="s2">know 100 times probably nobody has ever</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.980" end="00:40:50.490" style="s2">raised their hand</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.849" end="00:40:52.770" style="s2">nobody ever if you live in the United</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.490" end="00:40:54.359" style="s2">States you basically short I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.770" end="00:40:55.980" style="s2">only outsider case would be if your</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.359" end="00:40:57.390" style="s2">grandparents were oil barons or</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.980" end="00:40:59.070" style="s2">something like that and then they lost</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.390" end="00:41:00.510" style="s2">all the money in which case in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.070" end="00:41:02.190" style="s2">case the leftist would actually love</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.510" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">that too because it would show that well</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.190" end="00:41:05.369" style="s2">it would show that that accumulated</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:07.800" style="s2">wealth doesn&#39;t stay beyond generation so</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.369" end="00:41:09.390" style="s2">they&#39;re all about that right so but if</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.800" end="00:41:09.720" style="s2">you can do something like that I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.390" end="00:41:10.890" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.720" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">I mean everyone in this room can do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.890" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">like can everyone picture their</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:15.450" style="s2">grandparents do you a bit better or</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:17.099" style="s2">worse I mean does anyone in here have it</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.450" end="00:41:19.859" style="s2">worse than their grandparents and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.099" end="00:41:21.869" style="s2">shows you that it&#39;s a perceived</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.859" end="00:41:24.000" style="s2">depression not a real oppression that</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.869" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">that the thing that they&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:30.570" style="s2">this patriarchal postmodern capitalistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:32.010" style="s2">thing that they&#39;re fighting I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.570" end="00:41:34.890" style="s2">can&#39;t define it so it&#39;s hard to define</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.010" end="00:41:39.570" style="s2">it for them that it actually has bent</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.890" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">toward justice always always and one</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.570" end="00:41:43.050" style="s2">when you get with you can plant that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:44.700" style="s2">seed in them I think it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.050" end="00:41:46.260" style="s2">of something but it&#39;s very hard to break</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.700" end="00:41:47.250" style="s2">them out of that but I think the key</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.260" end="00:41:50.040" style="s2">here is understanding that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.250" end="00:41:53.160" style="s2">perceived oppression if you live in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.040" end="00:41:55.590" style="s2">free society in the West in 2019 you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.160" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">not oppressed you you may be you may be</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.590" end="00:41:59.490" style="s2">don&#39;t happen as well as your neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:01.650" style="s2">does and maybe you came for more and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.490" end="00:42:03.090" style="s2">they came from less or maybe you&#39;re sick</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.650" end="00:42:06.090" style="s2">and they&#39;re not or a series of other</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.090" end="00:42:07.710" style="s2">things but you&#39;ve got a chance and</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.090" end="00:42:09.420" style="s2">that&#39;s all you&#39;re supposed to have in</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.710" end="00:42:11.730" style="s2">life and I think getting that through to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.420" end="00:42:13.530" style="s2">them as opposed to oh the system is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.730" end="00:42:15.060" style="s2">horrible and I have to now destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.530" end="00:42:18.060" style="s2">system as if they could magically</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.060" end="00:42:19.530" style="s2">reconstitute a system that really would</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.060" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">just be in effect throwing away</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.530" end="00:42:24.450" style="s2">thousands of years of human history that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:25.740" style="s2">they&#39;re so wise there&#39;s so wise at 24</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.450" end="00:42:27.570" style="s2">years old is they&#39;re shouting down</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.740" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">speakers that they could they could</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.570" end="00:42:31.830" style="s2">build up what nobody before them could</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:33.599" style="s2">and that that&#39;s the danger there so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.830" end="00:42:35.250" style="s2">think getting them to to think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.599" end="00:42:36.660" style="s2">their own lives where they come from I</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.250" end="00:42:38.670" style="s2">think is a pretty effective way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.660" end="00:42:43.619" style="s2">getting through to people well we could</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.670" end="00:42:46.700" style="s2">also say like look there&#39;s a claim that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.619" end="00:42:51.930" style="s2">the West is an oppressive patriarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.700" end="00:42:54.630" style="s2">so that&#39;s actually true the the problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.930" end="00:42:57.720" style="s2">with the claim is that it&#39;s not just an</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.630" end="00:42:59.220" style="s2">oppressive patriarchy and there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.720" end="00:43:01.500" style="s2">difference between something being</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.220" end="00:43:03.990" style="s2">completely something and something being</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.500" end="00:43:06.750" style="s2">partly something because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.990" end="00:43:09.390" style="s2">things you might point out is that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.750" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">can look at human history anywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.390" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">what you see is a complete bloody</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:17.150" style="s2">nightmare right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s death and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">struggle and privation and war and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.150" end="00:43:23.730" style="s2">horror everywhere with some progress you</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:26.130" style="s2">know some</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.730" end="00:43:29.579" style="s2">ability of us to pull ourselves out of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.130" end="00:43:32.730" style="s2">the mire you know and the West is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.579" end="00:43:35.400" style="s2">same is there&#39;s plenty of catastrophe in</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.730" end="00:43:36.930" style="s2">our past and of all sorts and and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.400" end="00:43:40.560" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s necessary to know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.930" end="00:43:42.690" style="s2">but then it&#39;s necessary to separate the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.560" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">wheat from the chaff you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.690" end="00:43:48.750" style="s2">things I see with readers who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:51.510" style="s2">unsophisticated and intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.750" end="00:43:53.369" style="s2">arrogant is they&#39;ll read someone great</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.510" end="00:43:55.829" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ll read Nietzsche for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.369" end="00:43:58.980" style="s2">and they&#39;ll find the odd thing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.829" end="00:44:02.070" style="s2">Nietzsche said that grates against their</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.980" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">current moral sensibilities whether they</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.070" end="00:44:07.020" style="s2">do that in context or out and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:10.260" style="s2">they&#39;ll throw away the whole book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.020" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">like you don&#39;t throw away the whole book</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.260" end="00:44:15.839" style="s2">it was Nietzsche you don&#39;t throw away</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:17.839" style="s2">the book he&#39;s like one in a billion you</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:23.430" style="s2">read it carefully and you think well</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.839" end="00:44:25.079" style="s2">okay no to that but yes to this and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.430" end="00:44:26.730" style="s2">do the same thing with darts Kiev ski</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.079" end="00:44:28.589" style="s2">and you do the same thing with Tolstoy</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.730" end="00:44:30.869" style="s2">and you do the same thing with the great</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.589" end="00:44:32.910" style="s2">writers of the past that have been</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.869" end="00:44:34.829" style="s2">passed down to us you you read</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.910" end="00:44:37.020" style="s2">intelligently you separate the wheat</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.829" end="00:44:38.010" style="s2">from the chaff right and you gain wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.020" end="00:44:39.990" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.010" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">well you do the same when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.990" end="00:44:43.980" style="s2">your own history it&#39;s like well of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:47.329" style="s2">course it&#39;s a bloody nightmare what do</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.980" end="00:44:49.650" style="s2">you expect it&#39;s like what&#39;s your point</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.329" end="00:44:51.420" style="s2">what are good we&#39;re gonna burn it down</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.650" end="00:44:54.060" style="s2">and then we&#39;re gonna have something</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.420" end="00:44:56.670" style="s2">better as a consequence well not so</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.060" end="00:44:59.069" style="s2">easily not so quickly maybe we read our</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.670" end="00:45:01.380" style="s2">history carefully and we think okay well</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.069" end="00:45:02.790" style="s2">what did we get right well what did we</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.380" end="00:45:05.069" style="s2">get right well the sovereignty of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.790" end="00:45:07.290" style="s2">individual that&#39;s pretty good the fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.069" end="00:45:08.099" style="s2">that you have right to property that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.290" end="00:45:09.690" style="s2">pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.099" end="00:45:11.730" style="s2">you could argue about the limits on that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.690" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">but you know you don&#39;t want someone just</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.510" end="00:46:48.570" style="s2">should be overthrown or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.220" end="00:46:52.420" style="s2">you know current low resolution and</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.420" end="00:46:57.940" style="s2">there&#39;s something to be said for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.890" end="00:46:59.410" style="s2">of humility as well it&#39;s like really you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.940" end="00:47:01.030" style="s2">really think that you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.410" end="00:47:03.310" style="s2">making large-scale social</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.030" end="00:47:06.250" style="s2">transformations and getting it right do</p>

<p begin="00:47:11.260" end="00:47:16.360" style="s2">enough to pull off something like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.840" end="00:47:18.850" style="s2">it&#39;s very very difficult very very very</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.360" end="00:47:22.630" style="s2">difficult to take a system that works</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.850" end="00:47:24.100" style="s2">not too badly and to do anything to it</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.630" end="00:47:27.010" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make it worse</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.100" end="00:47:29.350" style="s2">much less to radically reconstitute it</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.010" end="00:47:31.360" style="s2">and make it better that&#39;s really hard so</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.350" end="00:47:33.430" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re upset about your</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.360" end="00:47:35.890" style="s2">culture well maybe you could think of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.430" end="00:47:37.690" style="s2">some small ways that are local that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.890" end="00:47:40.500" style="s2">could go out and improve it well I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.690" end="00:47:42.700" style="s2">you should start with yourself because</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.500" end="00:47:44.710" style="s2">well then you&#39;re only harming yourself</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.700" end="00:47:46.510" style="s2">and you&#39;re not a bad person to practice</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.710" end="00:47:48.610" style="s2">on and then you could extend that to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.510" end="00:47:51.010" style="s2">your fat well at least you suffer for</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.610" end="00:47:53.170" style="s2">the consequences of your own experiment</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.010" end="00:47:54.820" style="s2">that way rather than having someone else</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.170" end="00:47:56.590" style="s2">do it and then maybe you can work on</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.820" end="00:47:58.660" style="s2">bringing a little more harmony into your</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.590" end="00:48:00.190" style="s2">family and maybe you can get a job and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.660" end="00:48:02.200" style="s2">see if you&#39;re any good at that and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.190" end="00:48:06.310" style="s2">if you manage those three things half</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.200" end="00:48:09.940" style="s2">ways respectably well then you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.310" end="00:48:13.210" style="s2">dare to put a toehold out into the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.940" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">broader community and think maybe I have</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.210" end="00:48:17.530" style="s2">an idea here that we could tentatively</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:19.360" style="s2">attempt that might make some small</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.530" end="00:48:21.790" style="s2">things slightly better that we could</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.360" end="00:48:23.560" style="s2">measure carefully and assess and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.790" end="00:48:25.270" style="s2">would be your contribution and and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.560" end="00:48:27.100" style="s2">you get real good at that you know so by</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.270" end="00:48:28.840" style="s2">the time you&#39;re 50 or 60 and you have a</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:05.550" style="s2">ridiculing of that respect for our faith</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.359" end="00:51:07.800" style="s2">out of the door we&#39;ve knocked out one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.550" end="00:51:09.810" style="s2">the pillars of democracy we&#39;ve knocked</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.800" end="00:51:11.400" style="s2">out the idea that whether I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.810" end="00:51:13.800" style="s2">you or not doesn&#39;t matter I have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.400" end="00:51:16.890" style="s2">respect you because they&#39;re a higher</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.800" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">authority places as much value on you as</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.890" end="00:51:23.340" style="s2">he does on me now it seems that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:26.490" style="s2">problem is that if you dare disagree</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.340" end="00:51:28.859" style="s2">with me I don&#39;t have a reference frame</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.490" end="00:51:31.020" style="s2">for good and bad anymore or for</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.859" end="00:51:33.270" style="s2">respecting you therefore I have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.020" end="00:51:35.640" style="s2">insist I&#39;m right so I&#39;ve got over my</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.270" end="00:51:37.640" style="s2">life and you dare to challenge me</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.640" end="00:51:39.869" style="s2">because you want to be got over yours</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.640" end="00:51:41.730" style="s2">well that&#39;s to say you&#39;re an evil person</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.869" end="00:51:44.570" style="s2">or you&#39;re a racer story or something</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.730" end="00:51:48.030" style="s2">terrible we lack a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.570" end="00:51:49.770" style="s2">respecting one another and it seems a</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.030" end="00:51:51.380" style="s2">massive problem for us well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.770" end="00:51:54.560" style="s2">problem with the collectivist viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.380" end="00:51:56.670" style="s2">because if if your defining</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.560" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">characteristic is that you&#39;re a member</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.670" end="00:52:02.250" style="s2">of a collective then you live or die by</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:04.440" style="s2">the propriety of the collective the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.250" end="00:52:08.310" style="s2">antidote to that is that strange</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.440" end="00:52:10.109" style="s2">metaphysical claim which is that well</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.310" end="00:52:12.330" style="s2">which is fundamentally that we each have</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.109" end="00:52:15.770" style="s2">a spark of the Divine in us you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.330" end="00:52:17.039" style="s2">well it&#39;s easy to be cynical about that</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.770" end="00:52:20.669" style="s2">but you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.039" end="00:52:24.809" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be because you act like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.669" end="00:52:26.609" style="s2">true and that&#39;s worth noticing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.809" end="00:52:29.929" style="s2">if you have friends or family members</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.609" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">and you don&#39;t treat them like they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.929" end="00:52:37.199" style="s2">profound intrinsic value then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:39.390" style="s2">not happy with you right you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.199" end="00:52:41.099" style="s2">can&#39;t have a loving relationship without</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.390" end="00:52:42.900" style="s2">that you can&#39;t have a relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.099" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">reciprocity without that you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.900" end="00:52:47.219" style="s2">a relationship of respect without that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.880" end="00:52:49.919" style="s2">none of it and they also want you to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.219" end="00:52:51.989" style="s2">treat them like they&#39;re in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.919" end="00:52:53.880" style="s2">masters of their own destiny which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.989" end="00:52:57.839" style="s2">also interesting right because if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.880" end="00:52:59.609" style="s2">ever say a 21 year old child and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:02.039" style="s2">upset with you they say well I&#39;m 21</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.609" end="00:53:05.369" style="s2">years old I&#39;m I&#39;m able to make my own</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.039" end="00:53:07.019" style="s2">decisions and you say and they want you</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.369" end="00:53:08.309" style="s2">to agree with that and you want to agree</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.019" end="00:53:09.809" style="s2">with it because you hope that there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.309" end="00:53:11.640" style="s2">ready to make their own decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.809" end="00:53:13.229" style="s2">you think well maybe they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.640" end="00:53:13.919" style="s2">matured to that point so what are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.229" end="00:53:17.099" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.919" end="00:53:19.859" style="s2">well you&#39;re saying that they are gifted</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.099" end="00:53:22.650" style="s2">with the ability to take the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.859" end="00:53:25.169" style="s2">responsibility to shape the reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.650" end="00:53:28.169" style="s2">around them and they insist upon that</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.169" end="00:53:31.199" style="s2">they insist upon you recognizing that in</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.169" end="00:53:33.239" style="s2">them as a hallmark of respect and love</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.199" end="00:53:34.709" style="s2">and you know you might be irritated</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.239" end="00:53:37.890" style="s2">because they&#39;re not acting responsibly</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.709" end="00:53:40.469" style="s2">enough to deserve that but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.890" end="00:53:42.719" style="s2">what you hope for and want it&#39;s so like</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.469" end="00:53:44.489" style="s2">well so what is it we&#39;re the sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.719" end="00:53:46.589" style="s2">cornerstone of the state each of us</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.489" end="00:53:49.259" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna dispute that well we know</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.589" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">the cost of that okay well do we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.259" end="00:53:53.699" style="s2">that spark of divinity well what do we</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:55.349" style="s2">struggle with day to day we struggle</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.699" end="00:53:57.779" style="s2">with the potential that&#39;s in front of us</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.349" end="00:54:00.029" style="s2">and transforming that into the reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.779" end="00:54:01.919" style="s2">that could be that&#39;s as close to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.029" end="00:54:04.259" style="s2">divine faculty as anything I can think</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.919" end="00:54:07.349" style="s2">of it&#39;s completely mysterious that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.259" end="00:54:10.349" style="s2">can wrestle with the fabric of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.349" end="00:54:11.819" style="s2">and turn it into the actuality of being</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.349" end="00:54:13.769" style="s2">and that we seem to do that as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.819" end="00:54:15.989" style="s2">consequence of our ethical choices right</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.769" end="00:54:19.019" style="s2">you make bad choices you think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.989" end="00:54:20.969" style="s2">bad bad things happen right and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.019" end="00:54:22.679" style="s2">think they&#39;re bad and so it&#39;s you took</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.969" end="00:54:25.289" style="s2">the potential that was there in front of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.679" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">you and you made something bad of it you</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.289" end="00:54:30.029" style="s2">can do that and you can also do what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.599" end="00:54:30.490" style="s2">good and we know that of each other and</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.029" end="00:54:32.290" style="s2">that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.490" end="00:54:34.060" style="s2">the reason that were granted let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.290" end="00:54:37.000" style="s2">the rate and the responsibility of being</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.060" end="00:54:39.100" style="s2">the cornerstone of the state and so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.000" end="00:54:39.490" style="s2">the idea that there is that divinity in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.100" end="00:54:41.110" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.490" end="00:54:43.360" style="s2">I think that&#39;s associated with our</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.110" end="00:54:45.640" style="s2">consciousness whatever that is because</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.360" end="00:54:47.740" style="s2">consciousness is a mystery it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.640" end="00:54:49.869" style="s2">give reality to being right what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.740" end="00:54:51.910" style="s2">without consciousness there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.869" end="00:54:54.130" style="s2">there to perceive anything there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:54:54.130" end="00:54:57.700" style="s2">anything there</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:55:00.340" style="s2">well our consciousness itself seems to</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.700" end="00:55:03.130" style="s2">be what participates in in the reality</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.340" end="00:55:06.220" style="s2">of being and and the the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.130" end="00:55:07.660" style="s2">of potential into into actuality for</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.220" end="00:55:09.070" style="s2">better or for worse so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.660" end="00:55:11.490" style="s2">ethical domain to it too</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.070" end="00:55:13.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s no reason for us to be</p>

<p begin="00:57:05.700" end="00:57:12.450" style="s2">you have intrinsic value and even if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.700" end="00:57:15.569" style="s2">do something terrible let&#39;s say and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.450" end="00:57:18.239" style="s2">still have the the conviction that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.569" end="00:57:20.910" style="s2">have value then it&#39;s incumbent on me to</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.239" end="00:57:23.160" style="s2">say well you did something terrible but</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.160" end="00:57:27.450" style="s2">terrible and it might be possible for</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.410" end="00:57:40.019" style="s2">systems and it&#39;s it&#39;s no time to be</p>

<p begin="00:57:48.809" end="00:57:54.539" style="s2">so enough crisis of confidence in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.440" end="00:57:56.249" style="s2">West like we&#39;ve got our house to put in</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.539" end="00:57:58.619" style="s2">order there&#39;s no doubt about that but I</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.249" end="00:58:01.259" style="s2">see no reason why we can&#39;t do it unless</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.619" end="00:58:03.150" style="s2">we lose faith in ourselves and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.259" end="00:58:05.749" style="s2">there&#39;s reason for that like life is</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.150" end="00:58:08.700" style="s2">brutal there&#39;s reason to lose faith but</p>

<p begin="00:58:12.690" end="00:58:18.180" style="s2">cowardice to lose faith so the problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.349" end="00:58:20.039" style="s2">with that though just very briefly is</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.180" end="00:58:22.499" style="s2">that the people that are that are</p>

<p begin="00:58:26.819" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">is bad they believe that America is bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.309" end="00:58:32.999" style="s2">that the freedoms that you&#39;ve won here</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:35.099" style="s2">are bad and what&#39;s interesting is I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:59:23.860" end="00:59:28.960" style="s2">like the libertarians they&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.970" end="00:59:33.070" style="s2">stoned but like you know you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:35.020" style="s2">also pro pot but but why is it that</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.070" end="00:59:36.100" style="s2">almost everyone right now I would say if</p>

<p begin="00:59:47.830" end="00:59:50.650" style="s2">exactly what your question was which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.510" end="00:59:52.360" style="s2">how do you sit down with people without</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.650" end="00:59:53.500" style="s2">impugning them the only people were</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.500" end="00:59:56.890" style="s2">any institutional power because you know</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.890" end="01:00:00.100" style="s2">someone says well but there it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.030" end="01:00:01.510" style="s2">white nationalists here and that and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.100" end="01:00:03.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like they have no power no one</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.510" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">cares about them the media promotes them</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.400" end="01:00:06.670" style="s2">to make it seem like they&#39;re massive and</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:08.650" style="s2">they&#39;re not no one but even the right</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.670" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">does a pretty decent job of saying that</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.650" end="01:00:14.260" style="s2">these people are no good so all we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:15.550" style="s2">really fighting is this hysteric what</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.260" end="01:00:17.860" style="s2">was that study in the Atlantic where</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.550" end="01:00:20.440" style="s2">it&#39;s only something like 8% yeah and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.860" end="01:00:24.220" style="s2">only 13% of them think it&#39;s gone too far</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.440" end="01:00:26.590" style="s2">so something like 8 percent of the of</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.220" end="01:00:29.350" style="s2">people believe really in this postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.590" end="01:00:31.450" style="s2">progressive view of the world and a lot</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.350" end="01:00:33.580" style="s2">of them are shaky within that belief so</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.450" end="01:00:35.170" style="s2">it seems like a big monster because the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.580" end="01:00:37.420" style="s2">media is always pushing it on us because</p>

<p begin="01:00:41.050" end="01:00:44.950" style="s2">think need to be a little braver perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.850" end="01:00:47.320" style="s2">but but are here and are willing to</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.950" end="01:00:50.530" style="s2">wonder that bravery in a moment of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.320" end="01:00:53.200" style="s2">that what you&#39;ve just said reminds me of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.530" end="01:00:57.160" style="s2">two remarkable men in history GK</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.200" end="01:00:59.290" style="s2">Chesterton and George Bernard Shaw they</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.160" end="01:01:00.730" style="s2">disagreed on just about everything you</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.290" end="01:01:02.560" style="s2">could think of but they loved each</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.730" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">other&#39;s company now isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.560" end="01:01:07.270" style="s2">incredible they couldn&#39;t wait to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.960" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">together to have another good argument</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.270" end="01:01:12.369" style="s2">and a good feed together</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:15.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what we need the genius of</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.369" end="01:01:20.350" style="s2">Western harmony surely is lying in our</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.400" end="01:01:24.580" style="s2">ability to respect one another even over</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.350" end="01:01:26.800" style="s2">our deepest differences and one day yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.580" end="01:01:29.260" style="s2">Chesterton was huge he was six foot four</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.800" end="01:01:31.119" style="s2">and very very heavy George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.260" end="01:01:37.450" style="s2">was in great shape like you two fellas</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.119" end="01:01:40.470" style="s2">and and GK Chesterton looked at George</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.450" end="01:01:44.110" style="s2">Bernard Shaw slim as a rake and he said</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.470" end="01:01:46.869" style="s2">by gee George you look as though there</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.110" end="01:01:49.270" style="s2">must be a famine in England and George</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.700" end="01:03:09.930" style="s2">Jordan did you expect when you started</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.310" end="01:03:12.220" style="s2">on this journey to end up like this and</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.930" end="01:03:13.660" style="s2">you asked him what it&#39;s like to break</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.220" end="01:03:15.550" style="s2">through that you know how do you feel</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.660" end="01:03:18.940" style="s2">about it when you&#39;re attacked and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.550" end="01:03:20.590" style="s2">are very open and very honest and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.940" end="01:03:22.119" style="s2">you said it&#39;s very tough when a</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.590" end="01:03:23.079" style="s2">journalist does you&#39;re over but you</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.119" end="01:03:25.239" style="s2">might like to repeat that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.079" end="01:03:26.829" style="s2">question two Jordan yeah well quickly on</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.239" end="01:03:28.539" style="s2">the bravery thing my partner hates when</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.829" end="01:03:30.670" style="s2">I say this but I don&#39;t consider myself</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.539" end="01:03:33.940" style="s2">brave I&#39;m doing what I think is right</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.670" end="01:03:35.829" style="s2">that is it that really is it I wake up</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.940" end="01:03:37.809" style="s2">every morning and I feel that I have a I</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.829" end="01:03:39.249" style="s2">have something to do that&#39;s relevant and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.809" end="01:03:41.920" style="s2">important and being on this tour with</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.249" end="01:03:43.690" style="s2">Jordan has been life-altering not only</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.920" end="01:03:45.279" style="s2">for all the people that show there but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.690" end="01:03:48.130" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t view it as bravery I</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.279" end="01:03:50.109" style="s2">couldn&#39;t not do it I guess is the best</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.130" end="01:03:51.400" style="s2">way to say it I couldn&#39;t ask God I just</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.109" end="01:03:53.380" style="s2">gotta make the point there I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.400" end="01:03:55.390" style="s2">you&#39;re probably being very tough on</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.380" end="01:03:58.029" style="s2">yourself I think the reality is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.390" end="01:04:00.279" style="s2">courage is not so much not knowing fear</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.029" end="01:04:01.450" style="s2">it&#39;s overcoming it isn&#39;t it and there</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.279" end="01:04:02.979" style="s2">must have been times when you wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.450" end="01:04:05.229" style="s2">sort of say gee I don&#39;t want to be under</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.979" end="01:04:07.209" style="s2">this attack well I guess I saw enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.229" end="01:04:09.069" style="s2">when I when I started waking up to some</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.209" end="01:04:11.049" style="s2">of what was going on on the left and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.069" end="01:04:13.420" style="s2">had seen the tactics over and over and</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.049" end="01:04:15.400" style="s2">how they destroyed good people I suppose</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.420" end="01:04:18.940" style="s2">that as that went on and as I woke up</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.400" end="01:04:20.979" style="s2">and and got out of it I just became numb</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.940" end="01:04:22.890" style="s2">to that and I just wouldn&#39;t I just</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.979" end="01:04:24.849" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t live like that I would think</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.890" end="01:04:28.269" style="s2">but the question that I asked you in</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.849" end="01:04:31.539" style="s2">Norway in effect was you didn&#39;t set out</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.269" end="01:04:32.559" style="s2">for this when when c16 came around you</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.539" end="01:04:33.579" style="s2">know you were doing all sorts of other</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.559" end="01:04:34.930" style="s2">things you had a practice you were</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.579" end="01:04:39.640" style="s2">teaching all of these other things and</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.930" end="01:04:41.440" style="s2">you yet you&#39;ve survived these it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.640" end="01:04:43.959" style="s2">even the attacks you&#39;ve survived a road</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.440" end="01:04:45.579" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t plan on being on and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.959" end="01:04:48.519" style="s2">bravery that you&#39;ve shown along the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.579" end="01:04:50.680" style="s2">is why people keep coming back they keep</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.519" end="01:04:52.209" style="s2">there rooting for us more as you often</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.680" end="01:04:54.339" style="s2">say it&#39;s like these hit pieces come out</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.209" end="01:04:56.229" style="s2">and then in a weird way and now I see it</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.339" end="01:04:57.880" style="s2">with me they&#39;ve moved on from you by the</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.229" end="01:05:00.519" style="s2">way they&#39;re working on me now but good</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.880" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">yeah yeah I&#39;m happy I&#39;m happy to help</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.519" end="01:05:04.420" style="s2">but in a weird way it wasn&#39;t that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:06.219" style="s2">reveled in it but you made a point of</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.420" end="01:05:07.509" style="s2">saying look every time they do it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.219" end="01:05:10.119" style="s2">still here</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.509" end="01:05:11.319" style="s2">and I think I really took my while to</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.119" end="01:05:13.089" style="s2">understand that because I always want</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.319" end="01:05:14.410" style="s2">you know I wanted to defend my friends</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.089" end="01:05:16.390" style="s2">but I also wanted to defend myself and</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.410" end="01:05:18.099" style="s2">now it&#39;s like all right keep coming I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.390" end="01:05:19.930" style="s2">still here we must be doing something</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.099" end="01:05:21.789" style="s2">right because I don&#39;t spend all my day</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.930" end="01:05:23.979" style="s2">attacking other people I&#39;ll gladly</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.789" end="01:05:25.029" style="s2">attack ideas but I don&#39;t attack people I</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.979" end="01:05:26.499" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve done anything</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.029" end="01:05:28.809" style="s2">up here where we attacked a singular</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.499" end="01:05:30.160" style="s2">person right and that&#39;s that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.809" end="01:05:32.670" style="s2">difference so the question really was</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.160" end="01:05:34.680" style="s2">you inadvertently you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.670" end="01:05:37.170" style="s2">I&#39;m not a big fan of quarters okay fine</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.680" end="01:05:38.340" style="s2">fair enough yeah exactly so every now</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.170" end="01:05:42.180" style="s2">and again though but I think I talked</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.340" end="01:05:43.500" style="s2">about her ideas in the public eye talked</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.180" end="01:05:46.890" style="s2">about her and her credit score but you</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.500" end="01:05:48.210" style="s2">know not her as a as a person but right</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.890" end="01:05:50.670" style="s2">and she is in the public sphere and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.210" end="01:05:53.369" style="s2">also impossible to never talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.670" end="01:05:55.050" style="s2">people so it&#39;s you can&#39;t be that lofty</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.369" end="01:05:56.369" style="s2">all the time but you can try to be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.050" end="01:05:58.350" style="s2">little bit but that basically you</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.369" end="01:06:01.580" style="s2">inadvertently ended up in this position</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.350" end="01:06:04.890" style="s2">where now by virtue of showing bravery</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.580" end="01:06:05.700" style="s2">well you sold out the Sydney Opera House</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.890" end="01:06:08.010" style="s2">in five minutes</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.700" end="01:06:10.350" style="s2">quit easily it&#39;s a matter I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.010" end="01:06:13.850" style="s2">matter of being afraid of the right</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.350" end="01:06:16.380" style="s2">thing that&#39;s the issue it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.850" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">decided a long time ago partly from</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.380" end="01:06:20.130" style="s2">reading Solzhenitsyn that I was going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:22.020" style="s2">try to be very careful with my words and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.130" end="01:06:24.330" style="s2">I was only going to say things that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.020" end="01:06:26.220" style="s2">thought well to begin with were lies</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.330" end="01:06:29.040" style="s2">let&#39;s say I was going to try to</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.220" end="01:06:31.080" style="s2">formulate my thoughts truthfully and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.040" end="01:06:34.440" style="s2">reason I decided that was because I</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.080" end="01:06:38.790" style="s2">thought that the opposite was hellishly</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.440" end="01:06:41.490" style="s2">dangerous and I really I really I really</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.790" end="01:06:44.910" style="s2">believe that I truly believe that and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.490" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">I&#39;m if I say things and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.910" end="01:06:53.010" style="s2">true and they get me in trouble then I</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.480" end="01:06:54.510" style="s2">think well that&#39;s not as much trouble as</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.010" end="01:06:56.609" style="s2">I would have got into if I would have</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.510" end="01:06:58.800" style="s2">said something that wasn&#39;t true like it</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.609" end="01:07:01.410" style="s2">might be more trouble right now who</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.800" end="01:07:02.640" style="s2">knows right because you and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.410" end="01:07:05.190" style="s2">know how these things are gonna turn out</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.640" end="01:07:06.869" style="s2">and I had this interview most of you</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.190" end="01:07:09.869" style="s2">know about it with Kathy Newman from</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.869" end="01:07:13.260" style="s2">channel 4 right and that was a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.869" end="01:07:14.730" style="s2">strange experience so what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.260" end="01:07:17.040" style="s2">is it was a great interview yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.730" end="01:07:19.680" style="s2">exactly exactly and you know she was</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.040" end="01:07:21.540" style="s2">pretty professional when we went to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.680" end="01:07:23.760" style="s2">studio like someone like that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.540" end="01:07:27.180" style="s2">professional kind of hard surface and</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.760" end="01:07:29.460" style="s2">glossy and and media presentable you</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.180" end="01:07:32.820" style="s2">know the TV turns you into that and she</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.460" end="01:07:34.800" style="s2">was perfectly polite in a professional</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.820" end="01:07:38.390" style="s2">way until the camera went on and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.800" end="01:07:41.910" style="s2">you know and then she went after me and</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.390" end="01:07:44.609" style="s2">and then the whole interview went went</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.910" end="01:07:45.930" style="s2">the way it went and I thought I I had</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.609" end="01:07:48.359" style="s2">like 20 interviews that</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.930" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">and and so I walked away from that and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.359" end="01:07:52.859" style="s2">thought oh god they&#39;re gonna take seven</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:54.510" style="s2">minutes of that and you know broadcast</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.859" end="01:07:56.609" style="s2">it and make me look like a complete</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.510" end="01:07:59.299" style="s2">monster and that&#39;ll be the end of that</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.609" end="01:08:03.930" style="s2">and that is exactly what they did</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.299" end="01:08:08.309" style="s2">except they also posted the entire thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.930" end="01:08:09.390" style="s2">on YouTube not knowing at all that it</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.309" end="01:08:11.190" style="s2">was a train wreck</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.390" end="01:08:12.660" style="s2">they have no idea wasn&#39;t like they</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.190" end="01:08:14.250" style="s2">thought oh well this is a train wreck we</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.660" end="01:08:15.720" style="s2">better put it on YouTube it wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.250" end="01:08:17.489" style="s2">at all they thought it was a perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.720" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">fine interview so then it went on</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.489" end="01:08:23.100" style="s2">YouTube and so well so like my mood</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:25.380" style="s2">changed a lot it was first of all well</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.100" end="01:08:26.759" style="s2">this interview went catastrophically and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.380" end="01:08:28.620" style="s2">then it was well they&#39;re only gonna use</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.759" end="01:08:30.270" style="s2">seven minutes of it that&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.620" end="01:08:33.390" style="s2">drag but I&#39;ll probably get over it and</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.270" end="01:08:35.730" style="s2">then they put it online and then there</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.390" end="01:08:39.929" style="s2">was just an incredible reaction and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.730" end="01:08:42.750" style="s2">five ten newspapers came out to play the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.929" end="01:08:45.750" style="s2">victim card for poor Kathy which was now</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.750" end="01:08:48.929" style="s2">all the online trolls were after her and</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.750" end="01:08:51.330" style="s2">I thought that really really struck me I</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.929" end="01:08:54.569" style="s2">thought she&#39;s one of the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.330" end="01:08:56.670" style="s2">people in the UK you know one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.569" end="01:08:59.460" style="s2">thousand most powerful let&#39;s say or the</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.670" end="01:09:03.089" style="s2">500 most powerful she&#39;s no bloody victim</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.460" end="01:09:04.739" style="s2">and she&#39;s play paid plenty well for what</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.089" end="01:09:06.630" style="s2">she does Jordan by the way don&#39;t forget</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.739" end="01:09:08.190" style="s2">that that night that this all happened</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.630" end="01:09:09.839" style="s2">she was she did a video in her car</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.190" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">reading the troll the comments by the</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.839" end="01:09:13.259" style="s2">trolls because at that moment she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:16.109" style="s2">realize she should play the victim card</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.259" end="01:09:18.330" style="s2">yet yeah she was not reveling it right</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.109" end="01:09:20.310" style="s2">and it was until she realized that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.330" end="01:09:22.170" style="s2">yeah yeah and so then her her employee</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.310" end="01:09:24.810" style="s2">said well we had to call in the police</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.170" end="01:09:26.969" style="s2">to investigate was that unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.810" end="01:09:28.859" style="s2">crooked thing to say it&#39;s like anybody</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.969" end="01:09:31.500" style="s2">can call in the damn police to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.859" end="01:09:34.259" style="s2">investigate anything it&#39;s like well what</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.500" end="01:09:36.210" style="s2">constitutes a credible threat well there</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.259" end="01:09:38.159" style="s2">are ways of assessing credible threats</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.210" end="01:09:40.259" style="s2">you know they have to be direct and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.159" end="01:09:42.960" style="s2">detailed that&#39;s that&#39;s how you assess</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.259" end="01:09:45.089" style="s2">suicidality for example if you tell me</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.960" end="01:09:46.679" style="s2">that you have a plan you know when</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.089" end="01:09:48.420" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do it you know where you</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.679" end="01:09:51.799" style="s2">have a gun you&#39;ve thought it through</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.420" end="01:09:54.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s a credible threat</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.799" end="01:09:56.340" style="s2">sometimes I wish I wasn&#39;t here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.600" end="01:09:57.449" style="s2">not a credible threat and you see the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.340" end="01:09:59.730" style="s2">same sort of thing online</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.449" end="01:10:02.070" style="s2">well then 10 newspapers played the</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.730" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">dim card that poor Cathy was being</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.070" end="01:10:06.570" style="s2">trolled by well at that point by like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:08.580" style="s2">million trolls who knew there were that</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.570" end="01:10:10.140" style="s2">many trolls but apparently they were and</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.580" end="01:10:11.760" style="s2">then I thought well god the whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.140" end="01:10:12.990" style="s2">thing&#39;s gonna go sideways again because</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.760" end="01:10:15.210" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna come out of this as the</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.990" end="01:10:18.410" style="s2">villain who called forth you know the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.210" end="01:10:20.910" style="s2">alright Armada to take down poor</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.410" end="01:10:22.470" style="s2">innocent Kathy Newman and so it looked</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.910" end="01:10:24.780" style="s2">like it was going to shift that way for</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.470" end="01:10:26.280" style="s2">about four days and then well that</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.780" end="01:10:27.990" style="s2">didn&#39;t work there was a couple of other</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.280" end="01:10:29.910" style="s2">interviews that started to push back</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.990" end="01:10:32.760" style="s2">that narrative and and then it switched</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.910" end="01:10:35.310" style="s2">back to my side but look I&#39;m making a</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.760" end="01:10:37.770" style="s2">point with this is when I do an</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.310" end="01:10:43.710" style="s2">interview like this interview um I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.770" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">I follow this rule in my book rule which</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.710" end="01:10:54.810" style="s2">is it let&#39;s say I think it&#39;s eight it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:57.750" style="s2">seven do do what is meaningful not what</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.810" end="01:10:59.400" style="s2">is expedient okay so I come to an event</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.750" end="01:11:01.890" style="s2">like this and I have an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.400" end="01:11:03.900" style="s2">say things and I don&#39;t come in here and</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.890" end="01:11:06.750" style="s2">think okay here&#39;s a bunch of things I</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.900" end="01:11:10.140" style="s2">want to convince you up you know it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.750" end="01:11:12.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re convinced it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.140" end="01:11:14.820" style="s2">not like I don&#39;t care about you you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.600" end="01:11:16.980" style="s2">in in the sense that you care for people</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.820" end="01:11:19.710" style="s2">and hope the best for them but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.980" end="01:11:21.930" style="s2">care if you&#39;re convinced either so what</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.710" end="01:11:24.480" style="s2">I&#39;m here for what I&#39;m here for is to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.930" end="01:11:27.150" style="s2">hear the questions and try to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.480" end="01:11:30.390" style="s2">what I think about them and then to say</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.150" end="01:11:32.190" style="s2">that and then to see what happens like</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.390" end="01:11:36.570" style="s2">who the hell knows what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.190" end="01:11:39.260" style="s2">but there&#39;s here&#39;s an in if if the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.570" end="01:11:42.780" style="s2">is properly constituted through truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.260" end="01:11:46.170" style="s2">then faith is the willingness to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.780" end="01:11:48.510" style="s2">faith in truth and so then you say what</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.170" end="01:11:51.000" style="s2">you believe to be true and then some</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.510" end="01:11:52.890" style="s2">things happen and sometimes they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.000" end="01:11:54.360" style="s2">so good which is why people often lie</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.890" end="01:11:56.400" style="s2">you know you tell the truth you get in</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.360" end="01:11:57.870" style="s2">trouble for it every kid knows that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.400" end="01:11:59.070" style="s2">like well why&#39;d you lie because I</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.870" end="01:12:01.110" style="s2">thought I&#39;d get in trouble well</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.070" end="01:12:04.170" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s like well that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.110" end="01:12:06.120" style="s2">good long-term strategy it&#39;s like so you</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.170" end="01:12:09.120" style="s2">say what you believe to be the truth and</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.120" end="01:12:12.600" style="s2">then you have the faith that no matter</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.120" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">what happens if you&#39;ve said what you</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.600" end="01:12:16.440" style="s2">believe to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:19.350" style="s2">whatever happens is the best thing that</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.440" end="01:12:21.449" style="s2">could have happened and I believe that I</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.350" end="01:12:24.540" style="s2">think that&#39;s how the world&#39;s constituted</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.449" end="01:12:26.310" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not bravery exactly and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.540" end="01:12:28.140" style="s2">would say it&#39;s more like faith it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.310" end="01:12:29.699" style="s2">I&#39;m going to say what I think I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.140" end="01:12:32.699" style="s2">try to do that as carefully as I</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.699" end="01:12:35.400" style="s2">possibly can and I&#39;m going to detach</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.699" end="01:12:37.050" style="s2">myself from the outcome because</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.400" end="01:12:39.300" style="s2">sometimes though it comes terrible I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.050" end="01:12:42.390" style="s2">at McMaster University or Queens and</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.300" end="01:12:44.100" style="s2">there&#39;s like a bloody mob of zombies</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.390" end="01:12:45.840" style="s2">pounding on the window you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.100" end="01:12:48.000" style="s2">little slice of hell you think this</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.840" end="01:12:50.489" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be a very good idea but</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.000" end="01:12:52.020" style="s2">you know the tide turns two or three</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.489" end="01:12:53.880" style="s2">times in the next three weeks and</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.020" end="01:12:56.340" style="s2">something comes out of it and so if</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.880" end="01:12:59.430" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have faith in truth it</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.340" end="01:13:02.070" style="s2">can&#39;t just be well did I get what I want</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.430" end="01:13:04.770" style="s2">in the next second that&#39;s not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.070" end="01:13:06.150" style="s2">faith it&#39;s like no I&#39;m gonna it&#39;s an it</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.770" end="01:13:09.270" style="s2">this is the other thing too that you got</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.150" end="01:13:11.670" style="s2">to understand I think is that without</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.270" end="01:13:14.820" style="s2">truth you don&#39;t have the adventure of</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.670" end="01:13:16.860" style="s2">your life you see because if you tell</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.820" end="01:13:19.260" style="s2">the truth that means you&#39;re revealing</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.860" end="01:13:22.610" style="s2">your being that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.260" end="01:13:26.400" style="s2">you&#39;re telling the truth and when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.610" end="01:13:29.610" style="s2">when you reveal your being then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.400" end="01:13:33.530" style="s2">you&#39;re living in the world you&#39;re there</p>

<p begin="01:13:46.140" end="01:13:50.730" style="s2">man if you hide from your truth well</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.630" end="01:13:51.989" style="s2">then you hide from yourself and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.730" end="01:13:53.969" style="s2">you&#39;re not even there and then who the</p>

<p begin="01:16:06.390" end="01:16:10.560" style="s2">it did the first time and by the 50th</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.490" end="01:16:15.090" style="s2">time they try it like as far as I can</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.560" end="01:16:18.450" style="s2">tell carefully the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.090" end="01:16:21.630" style="s2">enmity for me are out of ammunition</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.450" end="01:16:23.610" style="s2">they&#39;re done I read hit pieces now and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.630" end="01:16:26.540" style="s2">think oh you just copied the hit piece</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.610" end="01:16:29.520" style="s2">from two months ago it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.540" end="01:16:32.880" style="s2">perfectly habituated to that they&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.520" end="01:16:35.190" style="s2">of ammunition and maybe you know like</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.880" end="01:16:37.020" style="s2">someone creative could still come up</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.190" end="01:16:40.440" style="s2">with some more ammunition maybe that</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.020" end="01:16:42.840" style="s2">will happen at the QA but</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.440" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not bravery man it&#39;s faith in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.840" end="01:16:46.710" style="s2">in the redeeming power of truth and</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:49.010" style="s2">that&#39;s different I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.710" end="01:16:51.750" style="s2">incredibly interesting and encouraging</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.010" end="01:16:53.489" style="s2">let&#39;s come through a couple of questions</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.750" end="01:16:56.400" style="s2">yep I&#39;ll just preface them by saying</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.489" end="01:16:58.050" style="s2">there&#39;s been a we actually did a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.400" end="01:16:59.640" style="s2">research on this and one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.050" end="01:17:01.380" style="s2">that people say is they love hearing</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.640" end="01:17:03.960" style="s2">your stories and they love hearing you</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.380" end="01:17:06.600" style="s2">being open and they love it when you</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.960" end="01:17:08.370" style="s2">connect personally with them and</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.600" end="01:17:11.040" style="s2">somebody wanted to connect with you and</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.370" end="01:17:12.989" style="s2">Tammy Tammy is here with you and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.040" end="01:17:16.500" style="s2">I think very conscious of the incredible</p>

<p begin="01:17:41.520" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">understand and so we contend we can tend</p>

<p begin="01:18:02.520" end="01:18:06.600" style="s2">and the word contending is one that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.980" end="01:18:07.980" style="s2">actually used a few days ago on a</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.600" end="01:18:09.989" style="s2">different platform in a different City</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.980" end="01:18:11.520" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to young people and you</p>

<p begin="01:18:11.520" end="01:18:15.930" style="s2">whom they would contend and I think of</p>

<p begin="01:18:46.770" end="01:18:52.110" style="s2">a lot about what is going on but also a</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.640" end="01:18:54.060" style="s2">lot about our family because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.110" end="01:18:55.710" style="s2">complicated things going on in our</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.060" end="01:18:59.130" style="s2">we like there are in most families and</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.710" end="01:19:01.890" style="s2">we do our best to communicate you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.130" end="01:19:04.410" style="s2">when she says what she thinks and I say</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.890" end="01:19:08.700" style="s2">what I think and we don&#39;t always think</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.410" end="01:19:11.760" style="s2">the same thing you know but we do our</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.700" end="01:19:13.470" style="s2">best to listen we do our best to assume</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.760" end="01:19:15.060" style="s2">that just because the other person has a</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.470" end="01:19:16.020" style="s2">different opinion doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.060" end="01:19:17.460" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.020" end="01:19:20.810" style="s2">even though it would be lovely if they</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.460" end="01:19:24.420" style="s2">were and then we try to come up with a</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.810" end="01:19:26.850" style="s2">negotiated solution that&#39;s mutually</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.420" end="01:19:29.370" style="s2">acceptable you know and and we discuss</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.850" end="01:19:32.070" style="s2">strategy as well I mean for example when</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.370" end="01:19:34.530" style="s2">we started this tour which was more than</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.070" end="01:19:35.910" style="s2">a year ago we thought you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.530" end="01:19:37.920" style="s2">lot of competing things that you could</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.910" end="01:19:39.900" style="s2">think about a tour especially when we</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.920" end="01:19:42.750" style="s2">had no idea how long it would be like</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.900" end="01:19:44.760" style="s2">what was this was this a vacation we</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.750" end="01:19:48.540" style="s2">were going to you know spectacular</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.760" end="01:19:50.700" style="s2">cities all over the world was it time</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.540" end="01:19:53.370" style="s2">for us to spend together like what was</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.700" end="01:19:56.130" style="s2">it what were we doing and and we spent</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.370" end="01:19:59.190" style="s2">two hours thinking it&#39;s like no this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.130" end="01:20:02.400" style="s2">work we have a remarkable opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.190" end="01:20:03.750" style="s2">here and and and we&#39;re going to do the</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.400" end="01:20:06.360" style="s2">work we&#39;re going to hit as many cities</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.750" end="01:20:07.830" style="s2">as we can and so what does that mean it</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.360" end="01:20:10.140" style="s2">means we get the hell up in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.830" end="01:20:12.330" style="s2">we make sure we&#39;re packed our suitcases</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.140" end="01:20:14.370" style="s2">aren&#39;t too full we don&#39;t carry anything</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.330" end="01:20:15.990" style="s2">that goes underneath the plane we make</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.370" end="01:20:18.180" style="s2">sure that I don&#39;t get hungry because</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.990" end="01:20:19.500" style="s2">then I can&#39;t perform properly we make</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.180" end="01:20:22.800" style="s2">sure that I&#39;m at the theater at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.500" end="01:20:25.530" style="s2">right point in time and we make sure</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.800" end="01:20:27.450" style="s2">that our eye is focused on the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.530" end="01:20:29.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a great privilege and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.450" end="01:20:32.250" style="s2">unlikely that we can do this and so we</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.970" end="01:20:34.260" style="s2">thought okay that&#39;s the deal and then we</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.250" end="01:20:36.300" style="s2">thought well and then we can take an</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.260" end="01:20:38.250" style="s2">hour or two here and there if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.300" end="01:20:40.200" style="s2">fortunate to see some of the city and to</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.250" end="01:20:42.390" style="s2">take a break and to do that when we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.200" end="01:20:45.120" style="s2">and you know we&#39;ve negotiated other</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.390" end="01:20:47.190" style="s2">details about exactly how intense the</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.120" end="01:20:49.980" style="s2">scheduling was going to be but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.190" end="01:20:52.410" style="s2">constant negotiation and it is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.980" end="01:20:55.560" style="s2">contentious negotiation which is good</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.410" end="01:20:57.990" style="s2">because these things are complicated you</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.560" end="01:21:00.210" style="s2">know and to think something complicated</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.990" end="01:21:02.130" style="s2">through you need a good argument on this</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.210" end="01:21:03.690" style="s2">side and you need a good argument on</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.130" end="01:21:05.580" style="s2">this side and then you go to have a derp</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.690" end="01:21:08.400" style="s2">and see if you can come out with an even</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.580" end="01:21:10.500" style="s2">better argument as a consequence and so</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.400" end="01:21:12.480" style="s2">seemed to work now there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.500" end="01:21:15.360" style="s2">advantages it turns out that Tammy is</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.480" end="01:21:16.590" style="s2">very suited I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m speaking from</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.360" end="01:21:18.870" style="s2">for her but she doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.590" end="01:21:20.429" style="s2">microphone and actually prefers to stay</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.870" end="01:21:22.250" style="s2">in the background to some degree for</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.429" end="01:21:25.020" style="s2">various reasons</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.250" end="01:21:28.380" style="s2">she&#39;s very suited to a life like this</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.020" end="01:21:31.199" style="s2">she&#39;s quite stable emotionally so she</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.380" end="01:21:34.550" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t suffer from a lot of anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.199" end="01:21:34.550" style="s2">she likes to travel</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.360" end="01:21:40.949" style="s2">she likes meeting new people she likes</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.070" end="01:21:44.330" style="s2">the adventure and she&#39;s supporting what</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.949" end="01:21:46.770" style="s2">I&#39;m doing and so that&#39;s working and</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.330" end="01:21:49.350" style="s2">thank God for that and then she also</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.770" end="01:21:53.040" style="s2">keeps an eye on what I&#39;m doing and lets</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.350" end="01:21:55.560" style="s2">me know when it&#39;s going well and when</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.040" end="01:21:58.710" style="s2">she thinks it needs improvement and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.560" end="01:22:02.250" style="s2">and she helps me figure out where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.710" end="01:22:04.409" style="s2">going next because for the last two</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.250" end="01:22:07.170" style="s2">years my schedule has been so busy that</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.409" end="01:22:09.590" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing next usually</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.170" end="01:22:12.540" style="s2">maybe the next day and so her job</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.590" end="01:22:15.600" style="s2">because we&#39;ve also parceled out jobs is</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.540" end="01:22:19.340" style="s2">to make sure that I get wherever I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.600" end="01:22:22.020" style="s2">going next on time and ready and so far</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.340" end="01:22:25.380" style="s2">that&#39;s brought I would say incalculable</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.020" end="01:22:27.810" style="s2">benefits fundamentally and and because</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.380" end="01:22:30.420" style="s2">we agreed on it we had our little</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.810" end="01:22:34.679" style="s2">Constitution in place we were able to</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.420" end="01:22:37.260" style="s2">handle the stress because I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.679" end="01:22:40.920" style="s2">been in a hundred and it&#39;s damn-near 150</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.260" end="01:22:46.290" style="s2">cities in 350 days and so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.920" end="01:22:49.620" style="s2">heavy traveling schedule but Andy the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.290" end="01:22:52.080" style="s2">other thing too is I trust her she tells</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.620" end="01:22:53.760" style="s2">me the truth it isn&#39;t necessarily what I</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.080" end="01:22:55.860" style="s2">want to hear well you can tell that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.760" end="01:22:58.320" style="s2">the truth man what you don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.860" end="01:23:01.550" style="s2">want to hear but so she&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.320" end="01:23:06.870" style="s2">counselor and that&#39;s turned out to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.550" end="01:23:09.980" style="s2">exceptionally helpful so yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.870" end="01:23:13.090" style="s2">like their son who refuses to leave yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.980" end="01:23:16.330" style="s2">I like it mom yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.090" end="01:23:30.310" style="s2">you know I think we ought to give Tammy</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.330" end="01:23:33.580" style="s2">a round of applause Dave I think one for</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.310" end="01:23:36.850" style="s2">you comes from Monica Wilkie it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.580" end="01:23:41.200" style="s2">dealing with difference thank you John</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.850" end="01:23:44.050" style="s2">Dave I wanted to ask is it possible to</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.200" end="01:23:46.840" style="s2">come to a resolution with someone who</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.050" end="01:23:49.450" style="s2">has different values to you so for</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.840" end="01:23:51.790" style="s2">example if I have free speech is my</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.450" end="01:23:54.130" style="s2">highest value and I&#39;m talking to someone</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.790" end="01:23:56.470" style="s2">who believes that diversity and equality</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.130" end="01:23:58.690" style="s2">is a higher value and therefore free</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.470" end="01:24:01.300" style="s2">speech should be quelled in order to</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.690" end="01:24:04.000" style="s2">achieve this is it possible to reconcile</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.300" end="01:24:06.520" style="s2">these differences I think it is the best</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.000" end="01:24:07.720" style="s2">example that I can give you and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.520" end="01:24:09.880" style="s2">some of you have seen this I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.720" end="01:24:12.130" style="s2">couple interviews and debates with ben</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.880" end="01:24:14.200" style="s2">shapiro now ben is an Orthodox Jew he</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.130" end="01:24:16.090" style="s2">does not believe that gay people should</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.200" end="01:24:18.610" style="s2">be married well he believes that being</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.090" end="01:24:22.600" style="s2">gay is a sin is the loose word for it</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.610" end="01:24:24.070" style="s2">right now Ben my studio is in my home I</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.600" end="01:24:27.910" style="s2">lived with my partner in my home</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.070" end="01:24:29.620" style="s2">obviously Ben and I were friends to it</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.910" end="01:24:31.300" style="s2">to a certain point you know you mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.620" end="01:24:34.090" style="s2">like you&#39;ve got like your best friend in</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.300" end="01:24:35.980" style="s2">life who knows you the way your husband</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.090" end="01:24:38.590" style="s2">or wife or partner knows you and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.980" end="01:24:40.870" style="s2">and then you have sort of other tiers of</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.590" end="01:24:44.050" style="s2">friends Ben will never as long as we</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.870" end="01:24:46.060" style="s2">have this disconnect there&#39;s you know he</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.050" end="01:24:47.620" style="s2">last time I had him on when we discussed</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.060" end="01:24:49.270" style="s2">this he said that you know it caught</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.620" end="01:24:52.780" style="s2">fire on the internet he said he wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.270" end="01:24:54.280" style="s2">bake me a a gay wedding cake right or</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.780" end="01:24:55.750" style="s2">even come to an anniversary party</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.280" end="01:24:57.700" style="s2">because it would be celebrating</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.750" end="01:24:59.830" style="s2">something that he doesn&#39;t believe in and</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.700" end="01:25:01.630" style="s2">I remember when we were having the</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.830" end="01:25:03.700" style="s2">discussion I thought all right well</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.630" end="01:25:07.000" style="s2">here&#39;s a really interesting moment I can</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.700" end="01:25:09.670" style="s2">now berate him and I can demand that he</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.000" end="01:25:13.180" style="s2">acquiesce and and put aside whatever his</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.670" end="01:25:15.100" style="s2">beliefs are so that he will believe what</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.180" end="01:25:16.810" style="s2">I want him to believe even if I think it</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.100" end="01:25:19.030" style="s2">is the right thing I mean I I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.810" end="01:25:21.550" style="s2">a good person I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.030" end="01:25:24.880" style="s2">doing my life as I see fit right Ben</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.550" end="01:25:26.469" style="s2">sees the world differently so can we</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.880" end="01:25:28.150" style="s2">ever truly</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.469" end="01:25:30.489" style="s2">through that I would say yes because</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.150" end="01:25:31.960" style="s2">what we agreed to for what we were</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.489" end="01:25:34.600" style="s2">agreeing to disagree on what we agreed</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.960" end="01:25:36.969" style="s2">to agree on was that it&#39;s not the role</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.600" end="01:25:38.770" style="s2">of the government to decide who can get</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.969" end="01:25:40.180" style="s2">married now he&#39;s less thrilled with that</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.770" end="01:25:42.910" style="s2">than I am because I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.180" end="01:25:44.710" style="s2">perfectly fine position to take heed he</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.910" end="01:25:46.180" style="s2">you know this you see this a lot with</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.710" end="01:25:48.460" style="s2">conservatives now where they when you</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.180" end="01:25:50.050" style="s2">ask them about gay marriage they&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.460" end="01:25:51.250" style="s2">the libertarian position they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.050" end="01:25:53.080" style="s2">taking at five years ago but they</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.250" end="01:25:54.580" style="s2">suddenly now that they realize it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.080" end="01:25:56.350" style="s2">law of the land in the United States and</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.580" end="01:25:57.580" style="s2">it&#39;s just the easy way out it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.350" end="01:25:59.320" style="s2">well you know I don&#39;t really care about</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.580" end="01:26:02.170" style="s2">gay marriage it&#39;s anyone can get into</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.320" end="01:26:02.680" style="s2">any contract that they want to it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.170" end="01:26:05.560" style="s2">easy way out</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.680" end="01:26:08.830" style="s2">I don&#39;t mind letting them slide on that</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.560" end="01:26:10.900" style="s2">because we&#39;re equal we made it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.830" end="01:26:13.900" style="s2">okay now so I don&#39;t know that you can</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.900" end="01:26:15.730" style="s2">ever well let&#39;s put it this way I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.900" end="01:26:20.290" style="s2">there are issues that you will have</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.730" end="01:26:22.360" style="s2">existential profound differences with</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.290" end="01:26:24.310" style="s2">people that you will not be able to get</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.360" end="01:26:26.260" style="s2">over but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.310" end="01:26:27.850" style="s2">cut them out of your life and as I said</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.260" end="01:26:30.460" style="s2">to Ben last time we talked about this I</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.850" end="01:26:32.949" style="s2">hope that you know we&#39;ll remain friends</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.460" end="01:26:35.469" style="s2">to whatever degree our friendship is for</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.949" end="01:26:37.239" style="s2">the next let&#39;s say 50 years and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.469" end="01:26:41.830" style="s2">little older than him but when I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.239" end="01:26:45.370" style="s2">know 92 and he&#39;s 37 or whatever it&#39;s re</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.830" end="01:26:49.540" style="s2">but he&#39;s 87 math was not my thing but</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.370" end="01:26:50.890" style="s2">when I&#39;m 92 and he&#39;s 87 that may be the</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.540" end="01:26:53.170" style="s2">long game would have worked here and</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.890" end="01:26:55.660" style="s2">he&#39;ll look back and go you know Dave you</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.170" end="01:26:58.120" style="s2">you probably were right I suspect I will</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.660" end="01:27:02.140" style="s2">get him on this one so I would say just</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.120" end="01:27:04.420" style="s2">generally try to be try to be as</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.140" end="01:27:06.670" style="s2">tolerant as the other people say they</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.420" end="01:27:08.170" style="s2">are they&#39;re not really that good at it</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.670" end="01:27:10.330" style="s2">they just talk about it a lot but if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.170" end="01:27:12.760" style="s2">actually try to do that and realize that</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.330" end="01:27:14.620" style="s2">the world is not designed to bow to you</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.760" end="01:27:16.270" style="s2">and that you can show people you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.620" end="01:27:17.830" style="s2">little bit better I just am a firm</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.270" end="01:27:19.480" style="s2">believer that that is what will</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.830" end="01:27:21.460" style="s2">ultimately get there but no you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.480" end="01:27:23.560" style="s2">get everyone right there and it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.460" end="01:27:26.770" style="s2">you to judge what relationships you want</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.560" end="01:27:28.750" style="s2">to be in thank you I think to bring it</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.770" end="01:27:30.280" style="s2">home and a question I think&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.750" end="01:27:31.360" style="s2">important than probably troubling or</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.280" end="01:27:34.960" style="s2">goes to the heart of something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.360" end="01:27:40.120" style="s2">troubling a lot of people now Rochelle</p>

<p begin="01:30:06.140" end="01:30:09.560" style="s2">something I mean that the fact that this</p>

<p begin="01:30:24.920" end="01:30:34.490" style="s2">here it&#39;s also reflective of a technical</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.600" end="01:30:39.860" style="s2">problem I would say we&#39;ve had relatively</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.490" end="01:30:44.560" style="s2">reliable birth control since 1960 okay</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.860" end="01:30:49.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not very long and we</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.560" end="01:30:54.880" style="s2">underestimate the unbelievable</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.360" end="01:30:58.790" style="s2">technological triumph of birth control</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.880" end="01:31:02.410" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the hydrogen bomb it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.790" end="01:31:05.770" style="s2">transistor like it&#39;s a major-league</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.410" end="01:31:08.650" style="s2">transformation in human interaction</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.770" end="01:31:11.030" style="s2">women are now free from involuntary</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.650" end="01:31:13.580" style="s2">reproduction that&#39;s never been the case</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.030" end="01:31:16.400" style="s2">in the entire history of the planet okay</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.580" end="01:31:19.490" style="s2">we don&#39;t know exactly what to do about</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.400" end="01:31:22.850" style="s2">that okay so the first idea in the 60s</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.490" end="01:31:24.770" style="s2">was hell let&#39;s party</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.850" end="01:31:29.650" style="s2">and you know you could see why it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.770" end="01:31:33.650" style="s2">what the rules for not engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.650" end="01:31:37.490" style="s2">promiscuous sexual intercourse seemed to</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.650" end="01:31:39.890" style="s2">have vanished so we had a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.490" end="01:31:45.830" style="s2">decades of experimentation it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.890" end="01:31:49.040" style="s2">well how&#39;d that go little hard on the</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.830" end="01:31:52.030" style="s2">family I would say that&#39;s not so good</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.040" end="01:31:55.160" style="s2">for kids AIDS</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.030" end="01:31:58.490" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t a plus could have killed us</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.160" end="01:32:00.530" style="s2">all and it mutated particularly to take</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.490" end="01:32:04.370" style="s2">advantage of promiscuous sex because</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.530" end="01:32:06.050" style="s2">viruses are very tricky things so it</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.370" end="01:32:06.870" style="s2">turns out that sex is a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.050" end="01:32:08.850" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.870" end="01:32:10.770" style="s2">we thought well it actually turns out</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.850" end="01:32:14.490" style="s2">that it&#39;s a lot more complicated than we</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.770" end="01:32:16.650" style="s2">think okay and now it&#39;s for 50 60 years</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.490" end="01:32:19.890" style="s2">later and we&#39;re trying to sort this out</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.650" end="01:32:23.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like well when is it okay to have</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.890" end="01:32:25.620" style="s2">sex exactly and when is it not okay to</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.430" end="01:32:28.980" style="s2">have sex and what does it mean that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.620" end="01:32:32.010" style="s2">okay and what is consent mean and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.980" end="01:32:32.970" style="s2">answer to that is well we never used to</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.010" end="01:32:35.310" style="s2">have to think these things through</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.970" end="01:32:36.420" style="s2">because the rule was don&#39;t have sex</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.310" end="01:32:38.790" style="s2">until you get married</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.420" end="01:32:41.730" style="s2">that was the rule now that isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.790" end="01:32:43.620" style="s2">rule okay so what&#39;s the rule well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.730" end="01:32:45.420" style="s2">not having a conversation about the rule</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.620" end="01:32:48.000" style="s2">we&#39;re waiting til someone does something</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.420" end="01:32:50.430" style="s2">that seems like it might be untoward and</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.000" end="01:32:52.470" style="s2">then mobbing them and trying to extract</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.430" end="01:32:54.930" style="s2">the rule out that way and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.470" end="01:32:57.120" style="s2">very effective way of doing it you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.930" end="01:32:57.830" style="s2">you want to decrease campus rape that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.120" end="01:33:01.110" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.830" end="01:33:03.630" style="s2">get real alcohol no one has that</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.110" end="01:33:06.000" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s like I did my PhD work</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.630" end="01:33:09.360" style="s2">on alcohol fifty percent of the people</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.000" end="01:33:10.950" style="s2">who are murdered are drunk and fifty</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.360" end="01:33:13.800" style="s2">percent of the people who kill them are</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.950" end="01:33:17.850" style="s2">drunk and almost all the date rape</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.800" end="01:33:20.400" style="s2">situations are consequences of excess</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.850" end="01:33:22.860" style="s2">intoxication but yet there&#39;s a party</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.400" end="01:33:24.810" style="s2">culture on campuses and anything goes</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.860" end="01:33:27.450" style="s2">and you also have this strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.810" end="01:33:30.770" style="s2">especially on the radical left which is</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.450" end="01:33:33.090" style="s2">which is unbelievably paradoxical where</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.770" end="01:33:37.160" style="s2">absolutely every form of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.090" end="01:33:41.130" style="s2">expression imaginable is 100%</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.160" end="01:33:43.590" style="s2">permissible because sex is fine but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.130" end="01:33:46.140" style="s2">so dangerous that while you&#39;re dancing</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.590" end="01:33:48.270" style="s2">with someone at a Princeton mixer you</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.140" end="01:33:51.540" style="s2">have to ask them two or three times if</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.270" end="01:33:52.860" style="s2">it&#39;s okay for you to continue and and</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.540" end="01:33:54.270" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s actually the case by the</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.860" end="01:33:56.010" style="s2">way I&#39;m not making that up</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.270" end="01:33:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like well both of those things</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.010" end="01:34:00.840" style="s2">can&#39;t be true now what&#39;s happening I</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.560" end="01:34:03.450" style="s2">think on the me to end of things and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.840" end="01:34:06.960" style="s2">affirmative consent end of things is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.450" end="01:34:10.320" style="s2">old sexual taboos are reasserting</p>

<p begin="01:34:10.320" end="01:34:16.740" style="s2">sex out from emotional intimacy and</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.450" end="01:34:19.590" style="s2">especially emotional intimacy I would</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.740" end="01:34:20.070" style="s2">say psychological intimacy maybe even</p>

<p begin="01:34:24.810" end="01:34:29.670" style="s2">think we can do it and a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.940" end="01:34:32.190" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is the backlash against</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.670" end="01:34:33.240" style="s2">that it&#39;s like well I feel used you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.190" end="01:34:35.460" style="s2">because one of the things that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:34:35.460" end="01:34:40.500" style="s2">the anti sexual abuse movement is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.820" end="01:34:43.260" style="s2">idea that well if you have intercourse</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.500" end="01:34:46.290" style="s2">with someone and then you regret it the</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.260" end="01:34:51.240" style="s2">next day that&#39;s evidence that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.290" end="01:34:52.640" style="s2">consensual well it is in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.240" end="01:34:54.750" style="s2">evidence that it wasn&#39;t consensual</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.640" end="01:34:57.030" style="s2">because it&#39;s evidence that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.750" end="01:34:58.830" style="s2">bloody well think it through right it</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.030" end="01:35:01.260" style="s2">was good for last night but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.830" end="01:35:02.880" style="s2">good for today it&#39;s not very wise the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.260" end="01:35:05.760" style="s2">question is well what constitutes</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.880" end="01:35:07.620" style="s2">consent and we need to have a very</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.760" end="01:35:09.870" style="s2">serious conversation about that like</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.620" end="01:35:14.610" style="s2">under what circumstances is it</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.870" end="01:35:16.860" style="s2">acceptable to give consent but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.610" end="01:35:18.810" style="s2">mature enough to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.860" end="01:35:21.810" style="s2">we want both ways we want to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.810" end="01:35:24.030" style="s2">do whatever we want whatever with what</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.810" end="01:35:28.890" style="s2">with whoever we want whenever we want</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.030" end="01:35:30.600" style="s2">with no consequences and we want there</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.890" end="01:35:34.620" style="s2">never to be any trouble about consent</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.600" end="01:35:35.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like well no that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.620" end="01:35:38.070" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.310" end="01:35:40.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that sex works very well</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.070" end="01:35:42.210" style="s2">outside of committed relationships I</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.110" end="01:35:45.810" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence that it</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.210" end="01:35:50.220" style="s2">does there&#39;s a strong proclivity across</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.810" end="01:35:53.220" style="s2">cultures for for the enforcement social</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.220" end="01:35:56.160" style="s2">enforcement of long term monogamy and</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.220" end="01:36:00.210" style="s2">there&#39;s reasons for that and I think you</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.160" end="01:36:02.010" style="s2">deviate from that at your peril so now</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.210" end="01:36:03.690" style="s2">if you if you want to deviate from that</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.010" end="01:36:05.970" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of reasons to do it</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.690" end="01:36:07.830" style="s2">and I can understand why people are</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.970" end="01:36:10.560" style="s2">interested in adventure and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.830" end="01:36:14.010" style="s2">but you know my sense also as a</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.560" end="01:36:16.470" style="s2">clinician is you know you only really</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.010" end="01:36:19.380" style="s2">get to try out about five people in your</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.470" end="01:36:20.340" style="s2">life you have to make a decision pretty</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.380" end="01:36:23.070" style="s2">damn quick</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.340" end="01:36:24.720" style="s2">you know like between 20 and 30 there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.070" end="01:36:26.730" style="s2">a lot of things to get straight and</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.720" end="01:36:30.810" style="s2">long-term mate is usually one of them</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.730" end="01:36:33.820" style="s2">and most of the time people should be</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.810" end="01:36:35.770" style="s2">more careful with their sexual behavior</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.820" end="01:36:39.220" style="s2">when they&#39;re young especially when</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.770" end="01:36:41.590" style="s2">they&#39;re drunk than they are and I think</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.220" end="01:36:45.700" style="s2">it I just think it&#39;s so interesting that</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.590" end="01:36:48.490" style="s2">all of the taboo reconstruction is</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.700" end="01:36:50.140" style="s2">coming from the radical left it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.490" end="01:36:51.970" style="s2">what you&#39;d expect at all you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.140" end="01:36:53.740" style="s2">it&#39;d be the damn right-wing Christians</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.970" end="01:36:56.080" style="s2">complaining about you know sexual</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.740" end="01:36:58.240" style="s2">immorality it&#39;s like no it&#39;s the radical</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.080" end="01:37:00.550" style="s2">lefties you know you you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.240" end="01:37:03.070" style="s2">sign consent before making any physical</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.550" end="01:37:05.290" style="s2">move and then that&#39;s so what really who</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.070" end="01:37:06.370" style="s2">thought that up that&#39;s the stupidest</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.290" end="01:37:08.800" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve ever heard you know how</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.370" end="01:37:10.420" style="s2">awkward that would be you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.800" end="01:37:13.450" style="s2">supposed to be able to do a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.420" end="01:37:15.490" style="s2">of nonverbal reading right I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.450" end="01:37:17.620" style="s2">part of romance you don&#39;t see it you</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.490" end="01:37:20.260" style="s2">ever see a movie where the two people</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.620" end="01:37:22.690" style="s2">who are dating exchanged consent notes</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.260" end="01:37:25.180" style="s2">like that doesn&#39;t happen so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.690" end="01:37:28.750" style="s2">unrealistic solution but but I think the</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.180" end="01:37:31.570" style="s2">real solution is that despite the fact</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.750" end="01:37:35.100" style="s2">that we have reliable birth control</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.570" end="01:37:38.500" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to relearn what the</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.100" end="01:37:40.660" style="s2">acceptable rules of propriety are with</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.500" end="01:37:42.610" style="s2">regards to sexual relationships one of</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.660" end="01:37:46.480" style="s2">the things I often tell my young clients</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.610" end="01:37:48.700" style="s2">is don&#39;t do anything physically with</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.480" end="01:37:50.860" style="s2">anyone that you wouldn&#39;t talk to them</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.700" end="01:37:53.830" style="s2">about because if you&#39;re too damn</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.860" end="01:37:55.240" style="s2">embarrassed to talk about it well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.830" end="01:37:57.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a little premature in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.240" end="01:37:58.630" style="s2">relationship to actually do it and then</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.730" end="01:38:00.490" style="s2">there&#39;s harm in it</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.630" end="01:38:02.500" style="s2">you know there&#39;s emotional harm in it</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.490" end="01:38:08.800" style="s2">throw on both parties there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.500" end="01:38:10.420" style="s2">cheapening of both parties so well so</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.800" end="01:38:13.150" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna take us a long time to sort</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.420" end="01:38:15.010" style="s2">this out but hopefully we can do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.150" end="01:38:17.080" style="s2">serious manner and and it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.010" end="01:38:20.710" style="s2">merely a matter of mobbing those who</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.080" end="01:38:22.600" style="s2">seem to have made an error so well</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.710" end="01:38:24.820" style="s2">Jordan and Dave you&#39;ve given us</p>
