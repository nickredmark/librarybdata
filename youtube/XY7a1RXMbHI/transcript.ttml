<p begin="00:00:05.310" end="00:00:13.660" style="s2">Well, now we&#39;re going to talk about the phenomenological, existentialist / phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.660" end="00:00:20.230" style="s2"> psychiatrists and their theories from the 1950s, and as I have noted before,</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.230" end="00:00:25.220" style="s2"> much of their thinking was motivated by what happened during World War II.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.220" end="00:00:32.509" style="s2"> The last time I gave you a lecture, I described the summary of Nietzsche and Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.509" end="00:00:36.050" style="s2"> about the situation of the world and the psychological situation of the world at the end</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.050" end="00:00:42.140" style="s2"> of the nineteenth century. And that was that our new ways of thinking had undermined our faith,</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.140" end="00:00:46.120" style="s2"> and our old ways of thinking. And that was a problem because people need something</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.120" end="00:00:51.080" style="s2"> on which they can build, and to orient themselves and move forward. Nietzsche and Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.080" end="00:00:56.660" style="s2"> both predicted that the result of that breakup was more likely</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.660" end="00:00:59.030" style="s2"> would be on nihilism, and all that that entails.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.030" end="00:01:03.620" style="s2"> Dostoevsky wrote about this quite extensively in a book entitled &quot;Notes from the Underground.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.620" end="00:01:07.189" style="s2"> If any of you are interested in it, especially in clinical psychology,</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.189" end="00:01:11.799" style="s2"> you should really read this book because it is one of the most brilliant psychological studies</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.799" end="00:01:17.450" style="s2"> once written to a mentally disturbed man.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.450" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2"> It is very precise, and there are parts of “Guilt and Penance” that are also true.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:21.700" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:21.700" end="00:01:28.090" style="s2"> I think the way they depict psychological phenomena is unsurpassed.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.090" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know how he did it ... I mean Dostoevsky was epileptic, I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.680" end="00:01:40.509" style="s2"> you know, but he was arrested by the Tsar&#39;s men in the late nineteenth century for being a revolutionist student.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.509" end="00:01:48.740" style="s2"> They threw him in jail in Moscow, and one day they put him</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.740" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2"> in front of a firing squad and shot him six in the morning, but they used blanks,</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:54.439" style="s2"> which of course he didn&#39;t know.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.439" end="00:02:00.369" style="s2"> He was so shocked by this that he developed epilepsy (which is possible, by the way).</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.369" end="00:02:04.609" style="s2"> He then had epilepsy for the rest of his life, but he had a peculiar type of epilepsy,</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.609" end="00:02:09.720" style="s2"> which is actually not very rare. Some people who have epilepsy</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2"> experience a phenomenon they call an “aura”, which is an altered form of consciousness,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2"> before the seizure starts, and those auras can be very strange.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:23.629" style="s2"> I once read about a man, his aura was that his hand was possessed by demons</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.629" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2"> from hell and he could feel the possession creeping up his arm, to his shoulder,</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:30.849" style="s2"> and when it got to his head, he had an epileptic fit.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.849" end="00:02:38.610" style="s2"> There is another case, this man had an aura where a double appeared behind him,</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.610" end="00:02:43.430" style="s2"> But when he turned to look, he had a seizure,</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.430" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2"> but if he didn&#39;t turn to look, then he didn&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:51.709" style="s2"> Such brain disorders are strange things, because the system is disrupted</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.709" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2"> lives, and is capable of many extremely remarkable deviant behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2"> Either way, Dostoevsky&#39;s aura was an aura that revealed the world. What Dostoevsky experienced</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:09.550" style="s2"> was that the meaning of things got deeper and deeper and deeper,</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.550" end="00:03:12.989" style="s2"> and the moment he would discover the secret of all things,</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.989" end="00:03:14.689" style="s2"> he had an epileptic fit.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.689" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2"> But he said the quality of his experience during the aura was so high, so overwhelming,</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:24.980" style="s2"> and so deep that he would have exchanged all his normal experiences</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.980" end="00:03:27.390" style="s2"> for those experiences. And he had them repeatedly.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.390" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2"> I really think this broadening of his vision and concepts is due to epilepsy</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2"> transformed him, among other things.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:41.000" style="s2"> He had been through some damn tough things as he spent a long time in prison with rapists</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.000" end="00:03:46.489" style="s2"> and murderers in Siberia, although he was some kind of aristocrat.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.489" end="00:03:52.349" style="s2"> He had a rough time, and I imagine that expanded his thinking too,</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.349" end="00:03:58.120" style="s2"> since he survived. But I really think his epileptic insight was essential</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.120" end="00:04:06.170" style="s2"> for his unsurpassed genius, so his aura ... Other people also experience epileptic auras,</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.170" end="00:04:10.849" style="s2"> such symptoms, and some people are so fascinated with the aura</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.849" end="00:04:15.260" style="s2"> that they are not taking drugs for epilepsy because they do not want to miss the experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.260" end="00:04:20.220" style="s2"> that precedes the aura, or the epileptic seizure.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.220" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2"> And Dostoevsky&#39;s experiences, the awesome element of the aura, is also relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:32.389" style="s2"> what we&#39;re going to talk about today. Because both Binswanger and Boss were very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.389" end="00:04:35.550" style="s2"> how meaning manifests itself in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.550" end="00:04:38.949" style="s2"> And they had opposite explanations.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.949" end="00:04:45.229" style="s2"> I actually think they are parallel statements, but the meaning that Dostoevsky experienced</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.229" end="00:04:53.300" style="s2"> is an enlargement of the normal way in which meaning is revealed in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.300" end="00:04:59.169" style="s2"> And people experience things like that in different forms of altered consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.169" end="00:05:05.030" style="s2"> Anyway, Binswanger and Boss mainly worked in the 1950s, and like I said, they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.030" end="00:05:08.340" style="s2"> very concerned about what happened in World War II.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.340" end="00:05:13.290" style="s2"> In fact, Dostoevsky and Nietzsche predicted that it would become nihilism, or</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.290" end="00:05:20.009" style="s2"> ideological totalitarianism, which is exactly what happened. By the time 1930 appeared,</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.009" end="00:05:26.360" style="s2"> the Germans had gone through a terrible First World War.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.360" end="00:05:28.150" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:28.150" end="00:05:32.150" style="s2"> And then they got insane hyperinflation.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.150" end="00:05:37.830" style="s2"> In the 1920s, Germany underwent that, in part because they had to pay such large debts for it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.830" end="00:05:39.500" style="s2"> the first World War.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.500" end="00:05:46.639" style="s2"> German inflation reached the point where it literally exceeded one hundred million marks</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.639" end="00:05:48.690" style="s2"> had to pay for a loaf of bread.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.690" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2"> They took wheelbarrows with money to the grocer.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:58.419" style="s2"> What happened was the value of their money fell to zero, and it does</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.419" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2"> more often than you think with economies.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:05.020" style="s2"> The value is zero, and that was it, then a restart, as it were.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.020" end="00:06:09.910" style="s2"> The war was terrible, and hundreds of thousands of men had been killed</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.910" end="00:06:10.910" style="s2"> or damaged.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.910" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2"> Then their economy collapsed.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:19.210" style="s2"> And at the same time, or a little earlier, the Russian revolution took place,</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.210" end="00:06:24.009" style="s2"> at the end of World War I, and communism was</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.009" end="00:06:28.599" style="s2"> came to power, and the communists stirred all over Europe, and in North America.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.599" end="00:06:34.789" style="s2"> And their goal was to bring about a worldwide communist revolution.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.789" end="00:06:39.220" style="s2"> So the Germans went crazy because the communists would take over the country, which is a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.220" end="00:06:46.289" style="s2"> was reasonable anxiety. And instead, fascism arose, and fascism was</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.289" end="00:06:51.740" style="s2"> a form of totalitarianism, and I think the Germans were desperate for order at the time.</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.740" end="00:06:52.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:52.740" end="00:06:57.250" style="s2"> And that&#39;s what the fascists offered, at least in theory.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.250" end="00:07:01.659" style="s2"> Unfortunately it turned out that they offered them a bit too much order,</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.659" end="00:07:04.780" style="s2"> or maybe way too much order, and it went downhill.</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.780" end="00:07:11.550" style="s2"> Then the whole world had to experience the horrors of World War II, and it was shocking</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.550" end="00:07:15.470" style="s2"> in many different ways. Not just because of the brutal warfare,</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.470" end="00:07:20.419" style="s2"> but because of the deliberate genocidal practices of the Nazis.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.419" end="00:07:24.310" style="s2"> And those practices were difficult to understand in several ways.</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.310" end="00:07:29.940" style="s2"> This is why it was hard to understand: there were times</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.940" end="00:07:37.669" style="s2"> detailing the cruelty faced by the Nazis with their theoretical enemies</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.669" end="00:07:42.569" style="s2"> destroyed, went far beyond the mere necessity of destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.569" end="00:07:47.560" style="s2"> Worse, it went beyond destruction to actual, ceaseless torture.</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.560" end="00:07:52.670" style="s2"> And not only that, there were many situations where the Nazis (especially when the end of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.670" end="00:07:56.250" style="s2"> war was approaching) had to decide whether they would continue to eradicate</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.250" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2"> Jews, Gypsies and homosexuals, and any people they don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:03.349" style="s2"> heard their culture, or that they would win the war.</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.349" end="00:08:07.410" style="s2"> They had to make decisions about the distribution of resources.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.410" end="00:08:11.669" style="s2"> If they continued with the murderous extermination, it would lessen the odds</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.669" end="00:08:13.629" style="s2"> that they would win the war.</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.629" end="00:08:17.780" style="s2"> This was often the case, especially at the end of the war, and the Nazis always opted for persistence</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.780" end="00:08:18.909" style="s2"> of destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.909" end="00:08:25.290" style="s2"> That is very interesting because you might think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.290" end="00:08:30.979" style="s2"> if they fight for one belief, namely world domination, it is extermination</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.979" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2"> a step towards the ultimate goal, the establishment of a world state,</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:43.020" style="s2"> a fascist world state, or at least a fascist European state.</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.020" end="00:08:48.279" style="s2"> Then you would think that the attempts at extermination are subordinate to that goal,</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.279" end="00:08:51.630" style="s2"> if they really pursued the goal they said they were pursuing.</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.630" end="00:08:56.370" style="s2"> But there is an old psychoanalytic idea that is very valuable, it is like</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.370" end="00:09:00.500" style="s2"> surgical tool, and I would say if you were to use it in your own life you should proceed with caution,</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.500" end="00:09:03.010" style="s2"> because you don&#39;t want to perform unnecessary surgery.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.010" end="00:09:06.730" style="s2"> The rule is (I think it is a Jungian rule, but I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.730" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2"> where I read it): If you can&#39;t understand why someone is doing something, check it out</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:19.380" style="s2"> the consequences of his actions, whatever they may be, and determine the motivation based on it</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.380" end="00:09:20.570" style="s2"> of the consequences.</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.570" end="00:09:25.190" style="s2"> So when you see someone who seems to be doing nothing but the people around him</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.190" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2"> and make yourself miserable, and you can&#39;t understand why, then one of the hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:34.010" style="s2"> that you can try to make the lives of all the people around him and himself impossible.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.010" end="00:09:35.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:09:35.220" end="00:09:37.740" style="s2"> And that, in fact, is his goal.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.740" end="00:09:42.040" style="s2"> People find these things difficult to understand because when we see things</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.040" end="00:09:48.060" style="s2"> Like the kids who messed up on Columbine, we always assume those people do those things because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.060" end="00:09:54.089" style="s2"> reasons other than those that appear to be the obvious motivations,</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.089" end="00:09:57.900" style="s2"> or the reasons they themselves give for their actions. Because the &quot;Columbine Killers,&quot; sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.900" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2"> the more eloquent, has spelled out exactly why he did what he did.</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:04.550" style="s2"> That is crystal clear.</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.550" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2"> You just need to read on the internet what he said, he told you what he was up to.</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:09.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:09.480" end="00:10:11.840" style="s2"> But people don&#39;t like to think that way because they don&#39;t believe anyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.840" end="00:10:17.240" style="s2"> could be under the spell of malice without any other cause.</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.240" end="00:10:23.209" style="s2"> Like he&#39;d been bullied at school, an outsider, and those things</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.209" end="00:10:28.029" style="s2"> applied to him only partially, and not to any particular degree,</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.029" end="00:10:32.230" style="s2"> compared to how other people in high school are bullied and an outsider.</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.230" end="00:10:39.230" style="s2"> It will be about ten percent, probably more in the direction of thirty percent. That doesn&#39;t mean that schools are constantly exploding.</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.230" end="00:10:40.450" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:40.450" end="00:10:43.190" style="s2"> It is a completely inadequate statement.</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.190" end="00:10:50.780" style="s2"> Either way, people get possessed by very strict ideological ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.780" end="00:10:51.780" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:51.780" end="00:10:56.070" style="s2"> They became so obsessed with such ideas that they were willing to do things</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.070" end="00:11:02.130" style="s2"> which you would think would be completely impossible for theoretically civilized people.</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.130" end="00:11:07.380" style="s2"> It turned out that such acts were possible not only for civilized people,</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.380" end="00:11:12.910" style="s2"> but that the people themselves, especially in Nazi Germany, knew what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.910" end="00:11:13.930" style="s2"> was going on.</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.930" end="00:11:18.709" style="s2"> You can&#39;t remove millions of people from a population without rumors circulating,</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.709" end="00:11:23.290" style="s2"> and we must not forget that Hitler was elected.</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.290" end="00:11:25.529" style="s2"> He was elected by a large majority.</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.529" end="00:11:31.630" style="s2"> It was an enormous majority, like no modern Democratic leader ever gets.</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.630" end="00:11:40.960" style="s2"> So while it is difficult for people to accept, it is difficult</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.960" end="00:11:47.490" style="s2"> so as not to hold every part of German society accountable for what happened.</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.490" end="00:11:52.570" style="s2"> You cannot blame it on the leaders… this is something to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.570" end="00:11:57.220" style="s2"> think about it when it comes to Hitler. Because one of the things you may ask yourself is</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.220" end="00:12:02.670" style="s2"> how he could be so convincing to his audience.</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.670" end="00:12:05.220" style="s2"> I&#39;ll give you an explanation.</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.220" end="00:12:08.170" style="s2"> Let&#39;s assume a few things.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.170" end="00:12:13.100" style="s2"> The first assumption is: there were many hateful Germans.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.100" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2"> Why?</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.100" end="00:12:18.339" style="s2"> They had lost the First World War, that was not good. There were many</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.339" end="00:12:21.649" style="s2"> hardened men left, for they had been in the trenches, and shot</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.649" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2"> and fought under truly ghastly conditions for years.</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:29.510" style="s2"> So there were a lot of damaged men.</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.510" end="00:12:35.220" style="s2"> And then their whole economy collapsed, because they were forced into one,</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.220" end="00:12:41.220" style="s2"> what historians see as a very punitive, peace treaty to sign. Everything fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.220" end="00:12:43.710" style="s2"> in a way that we cannot imagine.</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.710" end="00:12:50.070" style="s2"> In the 1930s, the Germans started to get up, and then Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.070" end="00:12:54.330" style="s2"> came to power, he began not only to re-arm but also to re-industrialize the economy.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.330" end="00:12:56.460" style="s2"> And he did that well.</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.460" end="00:13:04.019" style="s2"> Hitler was a good orator, although he was not a coherent one</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.019" end="00:13:09.330" style="s2"> philosophical theorist. But seeing him as silly is completely wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.330" end="00:13:10.330" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:13:10.330" end="00:13:11.330" style="s2"> He certainly wasn&#39;t stupid.</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.330" end="00:13:16.690" style="s2"> I wouldn&#39;t say he was very well educated, but he had developed a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.690" end="00:13:21.449" style="s2"> sense of aesthetics. And he spent a lot of time designing the cities he would build</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.449" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2"> when the war was over.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:30.740" style="s2"> And he designed those cities as places where art, or at least the Nazi version of art, would flourish.</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.740" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2"> There is no evidence that what was wrong with the Nazis was a lack of civilization.</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:40.050" style="s2"> In fact, there is more evidence that they were, I think, too civilized.</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.050" end="00:13:42.100" style="s2"> I will discuss that later.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.100" end="00:13:47.130" style="s2"> Anyway, you think, &quot;How did Hitler manage to put a spell on all those people?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.130" end="00:13:51.460" style="s2"> This is a hypothesis based on Jungian thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.460" end="00:13:56.310" style="s2"> I&#39;m letting you know because Jung has been accused of being an anti-Semite.</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.310" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2"> There are several reasons for this, partly because of what happened during World War II,</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:06.440" style="s2"> and partly because his theory borrowed much from Christianity, though</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.440" end="00:14:10.920" style="s2"> to other sources. And he believed there were differences in the psychology of people with diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.920" end="00:14:12.509" style="s2"> different ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.509" end="00:14:16.970" style="s2"> Whether that&#39;s racist depends on whether or not you like the person you&#39;re talking to.</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.970" end="00:14:17.970" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:14:17.970" end="00:14:21.230" style="s2"> Because political leftists think that there are cultural differences, and that they are important,</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.230" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2"> but if you bring that up in the wrong way, you are a racist.</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:27.779" style="s2"> And political right-wing people just think there are ethnic differences.</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.779" end="00:14:30.459" style="s2"> It&#39;s a tricky issue.</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.459" end="00:14:34.350" style="s2"> If there are no differences that are important, what about multiculturalism?</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.350" end="00:14:36.649" style="s2"> Then it is not worth keeping it.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.649" end="00:14:40.350" style="s2"> If there are differences, you have to deal with the differences,</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.350" end="00:14:41.850" style="s2"> so it&#39;s never right.</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.850" end="00:14:47.180" style="s2"> Regardless, Jung has often been accused of anti-Semitism, in particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.180" end="00:14:54.080" style="s2"> by biographers who were spiteful, ignorant and historically uninformed, and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.080" end="00:14:56.940" style="s2"> fundamentally malicious.</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.940" end="00:15:01.139" style="s2"> He worked as a CIA agent, it was revealed last year.</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.139" end="00:15:06.350" style="s2"> For years, he provided the US government with psychological reports on the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.350" end="00:15:09.240" style="s2"> psychological structure of the Nazi leaders.</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.240" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2"> He never told anybody about that while alive, it came (as far as I know)</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:17.139" style="s2"> only came to light last year, or maybe the year before.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.139" end="00:15:22.630" style="s2"> Regardless, the Germans were not happy with the situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.630" end="00:15:26.579" style="s2"> and they formed great crowds. What happens when people gather</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.579" end="00:15:27.640" style="s2"> in a group?</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.640" end="00:15:31.620" style="s2"> We talked about it last time, about Kierkegaard&#39;s idea that as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.620" end="00:15:36.410" style="s2"> have a group of people, no matter how sincere they may be as individuals,</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.410" end="00:15:41.710" style="s2"> the group is immediately not truthful.</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.710" end="00:15:44.449" style="s2"> There are real reasons for that, real psychological reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.449" end="00:15:49.170" style="s2"> There is the famous &quot;Asch experiment,&quot; I hope those are the right experiments,</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.170" end="00:15:50.889" style="s2"> ASCH, over line length.</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.889" end="00:15:55.829" style="s2"> You draw two lines on a board, of the same length, and you conspire with</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.829" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2"> the group. You ask a poor victim to play, who does not know about the game.</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:05.860" style="s2"> And you ask someone and he says, &quot;No, those lines are different in length.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.860" end="00:16:08.790" style="s2"> You ask someone else, &quot;Yes, they are quite different in height.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.790" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2"> And yet another person says, &quot;Yes, I see the height difference.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:19.740" style="s2"> And then if you ask the poor victim, &quot;Is there a height difference?&quot; and he says, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.740" end="00:16:21.750" style="s2"> You can understand why.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.750" end="00:16:27.350" style="s2"> If all those people say it there&#39;d be something wrong with them all</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.350" end="00:16:28.699" style="s2"> which seems unlikely.</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.699" end="00:16:33.150" style="s2"> Or he&#39;s the victim of a conspiracy, which is a bit paranoid, but in this case</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.150" end="00:16:35.810" style="s2"> actually correct.</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.810" end="00:16:38.730" style="s2"> Or he just doesn&#39;t see it right.</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.730" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2"> You can see it as modesty that he thinks he is mistaken.</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:49.540" style="s2"> The fact that a person goes with the crowd has to do with their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.540" end="00:16:54.740" style="s2"> being social and conforming, which is a huge benefit in many ways.</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.740" end="00:17:00.670" style="s2"> Because if you were all anti-social and non-conformist, a lot of you would be in prison,</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.670" end="00:17:05.440" style="s2"> and could we not have this pleasant, peaceful conversation.</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.440" end="00:17:06.440" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:17:06.440" end="00:17:12.960" style="s2"> You shouldn&#39;t underestimate the usefulness of conforming too much.</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.960" end="00:17:18.250" style="s2"> There&#39;s a funny story I read once, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true, but it could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.250" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2"> in which psychology students gathered and decided to fool their professor.</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2"> He walked back and forth, and the trick was that they didn&#39;t mind him</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:33.810" style="s2"> if he was on the left side of the room, they would talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.810" end="00:17:35.460" style="s2"> and look up.</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.460" end="00:17:39.400" style="s2"> And if he were on the right side of the room, they would pay close attention.</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.400" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2"> The story goes that after they practiced the trick for several weeks, they got him to lecture</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:45.620" style="s2"> right next door.</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.620" end="00:17:47.770" style="s2"> He never left that place.</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.770" end="00:17:52.020" style="s2"> I am telling that because it is quite clear that people can respond</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.020" end="00:17:54.750" style="s2"> on the signals the group gives.</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.750" end="00:17:59.010" style="s2"> A good speaker does a number of different things.</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.010" end="00:18:01.970" style="s2"> One is that he never speaks to the group.</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.970" end="00:18:07.670" style="s2"> You choose some specific individuals and speak to them, they represent group.</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.670" end="00:18:12.170" style="s2"> Then you can determine whether everyone understands it, and the other that a good speaker does</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.170" end="00:18:17.650" style="s2"> is to pay attention to the reactions of the group.</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.650" end="00:18:26.041" style="s2"> If a lecture is actually a dialogue, even if the audience only provides non-verbal ones</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.041" end="00:18:31.780" style="s2"> elements of the conversation, those non-verbal elements are important.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.780" end="00:18:34.570" style="s2"> You want to be in contact with non-verbal communication.</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.570" end="00:18:37.540" style="s2"> Hitler is a chaotic person.</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.540" end="00:18:41.730" style="s2"> He is very angry, partly he is angry because he was a frustrated art student.</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.730" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2"> He tried to be admitted to art school four times. So the one who is actually responsible for the Second World War</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:53.330" style="s2"> was the committee of four, which Hitler refused to enter the Vienna Art Academy.</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.330" end="00:18:54.330" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:18:54.330" end="00:18:56.700" style="s2"> He really wanted it and also had some artistic talent.</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.700" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2"> It looks like it was a bit conventional, but I have some of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2"> seen his sketches, and he was not a complete ignorance.</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:09.330" style="s2"> He thought it might be good to go to college, because he had just gone through World War I,</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.330" end="00:19:11.140" style="s2"> and that was no fun.</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.140" end="00:19:15.340" style="s2"> There&#39;s a story about Hitler in the trenches, he was there with</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.340" end="00:19:19.350" style="s2"> his comrades, and he went out to do something,</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.350" end="00:19:23.680" style="s2"> and when he came back they were all dead because a bomb had landed in the middle of the group.</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.680" end="00:19:27.980" style="s2"> You would think that would affect your psyche. Because after such an experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.980" end="00:19:31.770" style="s2"> are you either going to think, &quot;Things are pretty random and awful&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.770" end="00:19:37.410" style="s2"> or: “There is something special about me, because I was not killed by the bomb.</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.410" end="00:19:39.980" style="s2"> Maybe God has saved me for a higher purpose. ”</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.980" end="00:19:44.680" style="s2"> You can be sure that when you go through such an experience, it will</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.680" end="00:19:47.650" style="s2"> such thoughts run through your mind.</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.650" end="00:19:53.620" style="s2"> He was awarded a medal for bravery, and after World War I he wandered like</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.620" end="00:19:55.910" style="s2"> many unemployed men, like a vagabond.</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.910" end="00:19:58.620" style="s2"> He was not very happy about that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.620" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2"> Not surprisingly, however, he was not admitted to art school.</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.260" end="00:20:08.630" style="s2"> He didn&#39;t have a fully developed political theory, but he was one</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.630" end="00:20:14.490" style="s2"> good speaker, and there were many people who listened to him, because the people tried</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.490" end="00:20:17.670" style="s2"> to understand what they could do about all the chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.670" end="00:20:22.140" style="s2"> Well, then you ask yourself, &quot;What was Hitler good at?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.140" end="00:20:27.800" style="s2"> I am now going to tell a different story, and then come back to this.</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.800" end="00:20:36.170" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know if you are aware of the daycare scandals that were very common</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.170" end="00:20:37.170" style="s2"> in the eighties.</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.170" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2"> It was very widespread, occurring in many cities.</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:46.060" style="s2"> It used to be that someone who was slightly paranoid, or severely paranoid,</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.060" end="00:20:49.090" style="s2"> took his children to daycare.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.090" end="00:20:53.400" style="s2"> That was new in the eighties because women started to work en masse.</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.400" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:59.730" style="s2"> They gave their children (under the age of three) to total strangers.</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.730" end="00:21:03.480" style="s2"> Some became very concerned about it, as it still is, and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.480" end="00:21:08.980" style="s2"> that got out of hand. Especially in those with a tendency towards paranoid schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.980" end="00:21:13.060" style="s2"> and may have already had seizures.</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.060" end="00:21:17.910" style="s2"> The child came home and the mother saw something special, or not,</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.910" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2"> to his behavior and started fantasizing about what it could be.</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:26.340" style="s2"> Then she started to ask the child if it had been touched in a certain way.</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.340" end="00:21:29.310" style="s2"> She continued to do so for a while.</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.310" end="00:21:33.310" style="s2"> Soon the child began to have nightmares, and the child told</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.310" end="00:21:38.190" style="s2"> the mother what the nightmares were that upset her and started to ask even more penetrating questions.</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.190" end="00:21:42.530" style="s2"> And soon told her children that horrific things happened to them at the daycare.</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.530" end="00:21:43.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:21:43.800" end="00:21:47.660" style="s2"> She then went to the police, who did not review her psychiatric background.</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.660" end="00:21:52.900" style="s2"> The police went to question other children, and if they did it correctly,</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.900" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2"> the other children also began to develop stories.</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:21:58.490" style="s2"> How did that come about?</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.490" end="00:21:59.770" style="s2"> In a number of ways.</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.770" end="00:22:08.660" style="s2"> First, the police asked suggestive questions such as, &quot;Did someone touch you?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.660" end="00:22:12.660" style="s2"> Of course someone had touched the children, people are touching children.</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.660" end="00:22:14.970" style="s2"> &quot;Did someone touch you there?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.970" end="00:22:19.180" style="s2"> That&#39;s not a question, that&#39;s information.</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.180" end="00:22:24.560" style="s2"> It means that if someone touched me there, an adult there will hurt</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.560" end="00:22:27.710" style="s2"> is interested in.</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.710" end="00:22:31.350" style="s2"> What does a child do when they answer the questions an adult?</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.350" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2"> What do they know?</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:34.710" style="s2"> They are three years old.</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.710" end="00:22:37.260" style="s2"> They can barely organize their story.</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.260" end="00:22:42.730" style="s2"> If you talk to a child and you want them to give you a report of their day,</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.730" end="00:22:47.080" style="s2"> you have to lead them to organize their memories, and what they do in part</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.080" end="00:22:50.510" style="s2"> if you do, look at you to see if</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.510" end="00:22:55.370" style="s2"> they tell you the good things. What should be, because</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.370" end="00:22:59.220" style="s2"> they try to tell people things in a way that is understandable.</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.220" end="00:23:05.630" style="s2"> This makes the child very receptive to non-verbal and verbal signals from the adult.</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.630" end="00:23:08.730" style="s2"> Think about how quickly those little preschoolers try to learn the language.</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.730" end="00:23:12.950" style="s2"> That goes very fast and nobody actually teaches them. They are just paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.950" end="00:23:14.160" style="s2"> like a maniac.</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.160" end="00:23:20.220" style="s2"> You have some police officers on an adventure who think there is a sexual habitual</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.220" end="00:23:21.500" style="s2"> filthy in their midst.</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.500" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2"> They interview fifteen to twenty children, they do that with dolls, and very often.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:30.970" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:23:30.970" end="00:23:36.170" style="s2"> And sooner or later all the kids start having nightmares, and they start the police</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.170" end="00:23:39.910" style="s2"> telling terrible things. Like they were taken to a basement room</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.910" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2"> where they were undressed and forced to play “leapfrog”.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:46.120" style="s2"> It is unbelievable.</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.120" end="00:23:51.210" style="s2"> It is all recorded in a book entitled &quot;Satan&#39;s Silence,&quot; which was written by a social worker</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.210" end="00:23:52.600" style="s2"> and a lawyer.</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.600" end="00:23:53.830" style="s2"> It&#39;s unimaginable.</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.830" end="00:24:00.570" style="s2"> The longest prison sentences in America&#39;s history were imposed on a number of women</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.570" end="00:24:03.000" style="s2"> middle-aged caring for small children.</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:09.390" style="s2"> The FBI even invented a new criminal category: &quot;Late Onset Female Sexual Offender.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.390" end="00:24:12.190" style="s2"> Why didn&#39;t that category exist before?</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.190" end="00:24:17.630" style="s2"> Simply because there are no late-onset female sex offenders.</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.630" end="00:24:20.300" style="s2"> That&#39;s why we didn&#39;t need that category.</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.300" end="00:24:25.140" style="s2"> When all those accusations came out, it took a category for those women.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.140" end="00:24:30.790" style="s2"> Some were sentenced to 350 years in prison, which seemed somewhat unnecessary, given that they are still only</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.790" end="00:24:32.780" style="s2"> would live about forty years.</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.780" end="00:24:36.990" style="s2"> They were sentenced to life twelve times.</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.990" end="00:24:43.380" style="s2"> There was even a situation where a city went so far as to start digging around</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.380" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2"> to find those underground satanic hideouts where all those strange rituals would take place.</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:50.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:50.680" end="00:24:56.130" style="s2"> There was no concrete evidence.</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.130" end="00:25:00.310" style="s2"> The final conclusion, and this touched thousands of people ...</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.310" end="00:25:07.860" style="s2"> The final conclusion was that there is no one who satanically tortures children</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.860" end="00:25:11.540" style="s2"> in daycare.</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.540" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2"> Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:25.540" style="s2"> What the kids did, if you think about it, how did they come</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.540" end="00:25:26.540" style="s2"> to those strange ideas?</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.540" end="00:25:33.170" style="s2"> You have to know that kids aren&#39;t stupid, and they can get over terrible</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.170" end="00:25:35.820" style="s2"> things dream.</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.820" end="00:25:40.940" style="s2"> They have an imagination capable of reaching for the terrible.</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.940" end="00:25:44.900" style="s2"> Everyone knows that. Because you just have to think about how you, as a child</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.900" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2"> hid under the covers because there were horrible things in your dark room.</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:53.330" style="s2"> You could easily fill the darkness with monsters, and it should be,</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.330" end="00:25:55.720" style="s2"> because there are monsters in the dark.</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.720" end="00:25:58.450" style="s2"> Even if your parents may not say so.</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.450" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2"> There may not be monsters in that particular patch of darkness, and it&#39;s very reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:06.260" style="s2"> to tell your kids that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.260" end="00:26:08.160" style="s2"> But in the darkness as a whole, that&#39;s a whole different story.</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.160" end="00:26:11.410" style="s2"> Children are not stupid.</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.410" end="00:26:17.730" style="s2"> The adults begin to question them, and the back part of the child&#39;s brain, the imagination,</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.730" end="00:26:20.900" style="s2"> starts to think, &quot;What do these people want?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.900" end="00:26:26.850" style="s2"> They give a little information, and the adults respond,</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.850" end="00:26:29.070" style="s2"> and will focus on that information.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.070" end="00:26:35.960" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s a police officer who hates Satanist kidnappers, what a fair thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.960" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2"> position is.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:43.230" style="s2"> So if the child provides information about the existence of such a thing, the police officer will respond,</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.230" end="00:26:50.760" style="s2"> and the child will think, “Okay, so what&#39;s going on has something to do with that…” They don&#39;t consciously think that,</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.760" end="00:26:52.430" style="s2"> but their imaginations work.</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.430" end="00:26:56.250" style="s2"> &quot;How do I shape the reality that is presented to me?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.250" end="00:27:01.590" style="s2"> And then the dreams appear.</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.590" end="00:27:12.220" style="s2"> By speaking correctly, you can make all kinds of things come up</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.220" end="00:27:18.780" style="s2"> in the unconscious minds of your listeners.</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.780" end="00:27:26.110" style="s2"> And by looking at them, you can make out their unconscious desires.</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.110" end="00:27:31.470" style="s2"> Now I speak to you all, and you are frustrated because your life is</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.470" end="00:27:33.630" style="s2"> was terrible for about fifteen years.</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.630" end="00:27:46.570" style="s2"> I say this and that, and then I say something disapproving of Jews.</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.570" end="00:27:51.360" style="s2"> You are all angry, and there are two or three people who say &quot;Yes!&quot; call.</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:58.150" style="s2"> I think, &quot;That&#39;s an interesting response,&quot; and then I submit some more ideas</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.150" end="00:28:01.490" style="s2"> without getting a response, and to other ideas people react vividly.</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.490" end="00:28:06.780" style="s2"> And I&#39;m not stupid trying to get the attention of the crowd.</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.780" end="00:28:14.060" style="s2"> And if I do that fifty times, the crowd will tell me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.060" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2"> about what she wants. Especially if I am willing to go along with it.</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:20.821" style="s2"> I can do that easily, especially when I start to influence the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.821" end="00:28:29.220" style="s2"> because I can use their emotions and the expression of that emotion, and I can learn</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.220" end="00:28:33.010" style="s2"> to play that. And then that turns into a process of positive feedback.</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.010" end="00:28:37.070" style="s2"> So Hitler informs the public, and the public informs Hitler,</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.070" end="00:28:45.450" style="s2"> and that is why Jung believed that Hitler embodied the &quot;shadow&quot; of the German people.</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.450" end="00:28:55.050" style="s2"> That&#39;s another reason you have to be careful what you say, why you say it,</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.050" end="00:28:59.290" style="s2"> why you demand attention, and all that sort of thing. And what you actually do</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.290" end="00:29:03.500" style="s2"> motivates, and what the actual motivations are of the people who listen to you,</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.500" end="00:29:06.490" style="s2"> because who knows where you will end up if you are not careful?</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.490" end="00:29:11.810" style="s2"> In fact, we know where you end up if you&#39;re not careful, and that&#39;s not pretty.</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.810" end="00:29:12.810" style="s2"> That&#39;s for sure.</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.810" end="00:29:16.890" style="s2"> And think we&#39;ve learned something from that… No, we haven&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.890" end="00:29:19.590" style="s2"> We have not learned anything from it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.590" end="00:29:22.610" style="s2"> We don&#39;t want to understand.</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.610" end="00:29:25.520" style="s2"> These men were very concerned with that.</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.520" end="00:29:26.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:29:26.520" end="00:29:30.130" style="s2"> Binswanger and Boss had both been influenced by Freud and Jung.</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.130" end="00:29:36.970" style="s2"> You can see them on the bottom right, that&#39;s Boss with Jung, and that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.970" end="00:29:39.450" style="s2"> Binswanger on the left, and Boss above.</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.450" end="00:29:43.740" style="s2"> They look like thoughtful people and were pretty smart,</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.740" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2"> and they were highly philosophical, they had both studied Heidegger and Husserl,</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:50.930" style="s2"> German philosophers.</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.930" end="00:29:57.130" style="s2"> Heidegger got caught up in Nazism, and his philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.130" end="00:30:02.260" style="s2"> viewed with suspicion (perhaps rightly so)</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.260" end="00:30:05.130" style="s2"> as a result of his collaboration with the Nazis.</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.130" end="00:30:08.820" style="s2"> So it wasn&#39;t just stupid people who got involved.</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.820" end="00:30:11.290" style="s2"> About everyone got into it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.290" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2"> One of the things to think about is if you were there</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:21.650" style="s2"> each of you had a ninety percent chance that it had happened to you.</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.650" end="00:30:25.670" style="s2"> You wouldn&#39;t have been a person who saved gypsies, forget it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.670" end="00:30:31.490" style="s2"> Unless you think you are extremely heroic, and I would be very reluctant</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.490" end="00:30:35.400" style="s2"> assuming that, you may assume that you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.400" end="00:30:41.250" style="s2"> the crowd had come along, just like everyone else, because it happened to everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.250" end="00:30:46.160" style="s2"> What these men were trying to figure out was ... there were two things.</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.160" end="00:30:52.690" style="s2"> There was the function and structure of belief systems, and then the nature of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.690" end="00:30:55.280" style="s2"> that which transcends the belief system.</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.280" end="00:31:01.630" style="s2"> What transcends the belief system is what you don&#39;t know when you use that belief system,</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.630" end="00:31:05.380" style="s2"> because there are things outside your belief system that have their own nature.</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.380" end="00:31:10.110" style="s2"> Usually when you make a mistake you run into those things, and the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.110" end="00:31:14.090" style="s2"> do not go as you expect or would like.</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.090" end="00:31:19.070" style="s2"> And the other problem you are trying to solve is what is the correct behavioral form</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.070" end="00:31:25.940" style="s2"> for an individual in relation to belief systems and the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.940" end="00:31:27.150" style="s2"> that transcends belief systems?</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.150" end="00:31:30.610" style="s2"> The reason they were interested in that is because they thought:</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.610" end="00:31:34.710" style="s2"> &quot;Maybe it would be good if our belief systems didn&#39;t become so severely pathological.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.710" end="00:31:40.400" style="s2"> Because when that happens, six million people will end up in ovens, and more than 120 million die</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.400" end="00:31:42.490" style="s2"> people on the battlefield.</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.490" end="00:31:49.050" style="s2"> That is without counting the mass murders of Stalin, or Mao, next to whom Hitler in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.050" end="00:31:51.560" style="s2"> seemed an amateur.</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.560" end="00:31:56.060" style="s2"> Stalin left six million people to starve in Ukraine in the 1930s,</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.060" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2"> and that was just the beginning.</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:01.380" style="s2"> How many of you have heard about the Ukrainian famine?</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.380" end="00:32:03.070" style="s2"> How many not?</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.070" end="00:32:08.570" style="s2"> Think about that, how many of you knew that Mao killed a hundred million people?</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.570" end="00:32:10.650" style="s2"> How many not?</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.650" end="00:32:13.030" style="s2"> Think about why you don&#39;t know.</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.030" end="00:32:16.790" style="s2"> You know the Nazis, but you don&#39;t know the horrors of the communists</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.790" end="00:32:17.790" style="s2"> have caused.</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.790" end="00:32:24.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s worth asking yourself, &quot;Why?&quot; Because the communists, especially the Maoists,</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.200" end="00:32:25.590" style="s2"> were very cruel.</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.590" end="00:32:31.100" style="s2"> It is very important, of all the things you can learn psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.100" end="00:32:35.340" style="s2"> of the twentieth century. That&#39;s where these 1950s figures</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.340" end="00:32:37.350" style="s2"> focused on.</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.350" end="00:32:42.910" style="s2"> Things can go seriously wrong, it was a big shock to everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.910" end="00:32:47.270" style="s2"> Because everyone was excited when in the early nineteenth century religion,</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.270" end="00:32:49.180" style="s2"> traditional religious beliefs perished.</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.180" end="00:32:53.420" style="s2"> The Marxists said religion was there to oppress the poor,</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.420" end="00:32:58.940" style="s2"> and to maintain the priests and aristocracy. No doubt you learn a lot from that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.940" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2"> type of thinking in the lessons, based on power and economics.</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:12.090" style="s2"> That is typical of intellectually manipulative political leftist thinkers.</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.090" end="00:33:14.910" style="s2"> In fact, that&#39;s their routine.</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.910" end="00:33:19.210" style="s2"> They reduce everything to one drive, and usually it&#39;s economy or power, then</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.210" end="00:33:21.490" style="s2"> they explain everything from that perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.490" end="00:33:31.180" style="s2"> It is so shortsighted it should be banned.</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.180" end="00:33:34.400" style="s2"> The Marxists were happy that the religion had collapsed, because they thought so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.400" end="00:33:36.630" style="s2"> a great form of oppression disappeared.</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.630" end="00:33:41.460" style="s2"> And that is understandable, it was not that the Catholic Church was free from corruption.</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.460" end="00:33:46.141" style="s2"> In many ways it was a corrupt business, and you can think of it as merely a corrupt business.</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.141" end="00:33:51.240" style="s2"> &quot;Get rid of it, it is good that it disappears.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.240" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2"> And Freudians thought the same, as did most intellectuals.</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:03.830" style="s2"> Freud thought religion was nothing more than a childish delusion with which people identified</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.830" end="00:34:06.110" style="s2"> because they were afraid of death.</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.110" end="00:34:09.610" style="s2"> It was a defense against agony.</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.610" end="00:34:13.880" style="s2"> The Marxist and Freudian arguments are very strong,</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.880" end="00:34:18.440" style="s2"> because you can observe it: people use their religious beliefs as a defense against things</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.440" end="00:34:20.650" style="s2"> what they are afraid to confront?</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.650" end="00:34:21.700" style="s2"> Certainly.</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.700" end="00:34:29.250" style="s2"> Does the church oppress people, has it conspired with those in power for centuries?</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.250" end="00:34:30.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:34:30.740" end="00:34:32.220" style="s2"> Certainly.</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.220" end="00:34:34.980" style="s2"> The question is: what do you conclude from that?</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.980" end="00:34:40.470" style="s2"> You partly gather that all kinds of structures do that. That&#39;s how structures work.</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.470" end="00:34:44.280" style="s2"> You can&#39;t judge one structure and think the other will ...</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.280" end="00:34:47.940" style="s2"> As the political right always talks about big governments, how terrible that is,</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.940" end="00:34:51.880" style="s2"> and the political left always talks about how terrible big companies are.</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.880" end="00:34:56.291" style="s2"> Big is terrible, it doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s government or companies,</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.291" end="00:35:03.500" style="s2"> for things tend to corrupt over time, and this should be taken into account.</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.500" end="00:35:08.810" style="s2"> The Freudians and the intellectuals and the Marxists were quite happy</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.810" end="00:35:13.600" style="s2"> that the religious dream began to disappear. They believed the new constructs</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.600" end="00:35:18.620" style="s2"> that they would build, fascist and communist, would be so much better than the previous one,</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.620" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2"> that everyone would live in a utopian world.</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:31.420" style="s2"> It is a pity that nothing came of it, but it certainly did not happen.</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.420" end="00:35:32.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:32.420" end="00:35:38.660" style="s2"> What happened was… Sometimes when you break something off, even when you think so</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.660" end="00:35:44.470" style="s2"> it is terrible, you end up building something on its ruins, making the previous terrible</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.470" end="00:35:48.790" style="s2"> layman&#39;s work, and that is certainly what happened in the twentieth century.</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.790" end="00:35:49.790" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:49.790" end="00:35:54.650" style="s2"> Whatever you say about the Catholic Church and its barbarity,</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.650" end="00:35:58.100" style="s2"> especially during the witch hunts in the Middle Ages ...</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.100" end="00:36:02.310" style="s2"> Those people were amateurs compared to the fascists and the communists.</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.310" end="00:36:08.060" style="s2"> You count their victim numbers in tens of thousands, not hundreds of millions.</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:10.440" style="s2"> Either way, it didn&#39;t go very well.</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.440" end="00:36:15.620" style="s2"> And in the 1950s ... especially since the Cold War started when World War II ended,</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.620" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2"> and it ended with an atomic bomb on Japan. And the Russians had the atomic bomb a little while later,</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2"> and both the Americans and the Russians had the hydrogen bomb</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:28.730" style="s2"> early 1950s.</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.730" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know if you know this: do you know that a hydrogen bomb has an atomic bomb for ignition?</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:37.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:36:37.940" end="00:36:45.840" style="s2"> So the atomic bomb is proportional to a hydrogen bomb</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.840" end="00:36:50.620" style="s2"> as the spark in relation to the bushwort.</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.620" end="00:36:53.580" style="s2"> The detonation of the atomic bomb is only there to start the explosion.</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.580" end="00:36:59.290" style="s2"> So hydrogen bombs are much more destructive than nuclear bombs.</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.290" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2"> In the mid-1950s, we put ourselves in the position where</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:10.300" style="s2"> huge bombs were made, incredibly large bombs.</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.300" end="00:37:14.760" style="s2"> Four hundred times stronger than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.760" end="00:37:19.430" style="s2"> Huge bombs, and they got pretty good at it.</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.430" end="00:37:26.630" style="s2"> In the mid-1950s, we had plenty of firepower on both sides of the Atlantic,</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.630" end="00:37:31.110" style="s2"> and the missiles to deliver it, which the Nazis had actually developed</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.110" end="00:37:32.200" style="s2"> during the Second World War.</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.200" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2"> They were all Nazi scientists developing missiles, and they were all taken by the Americans</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2"> after World War II, to work on the US space program.</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:44.360" style="s2"> And in the 1950s, we also had the missiles to fire those things.</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.360" end="00:37:48.060" style="s2"> The psychologists who thought about what was in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.060" end="00:37:52.690" style="s2"> World War II had happened, were upset by that, and rightly so, and then the horrors set in</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.690" end="00:37:55.370" style="s2"> of Stalinism.</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.370" end="00:37:59.270" style="s2"> Although it took the Western intellectuals about thirty years before they could muster any recognition for it.</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.270" end="00:38:00.270" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:00.270" end="00:38:04.030" style="s2"> I think Jean-Paul Sartre was a member of the Communist Party until 1970.</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.030" end="00:38:10.520" style="s2"> It was very common, especially among French intellectuals, although the news was getting out.</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.520" end="00:38:12.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:12.140" end="00:38:19.380" style="s2"> Good observers like George Orwell had already noticed in the late 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.380" end="00:38:22.540" style="s2"> that Stalin&#39;s paradise was not what it seemed.</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.540" end="00:38:25.820" style="s2"> People thought he was the political right and didn&#39;t listen to him much,</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.820" end="00:38:32.390" style="s2"> when he was actually the political left.</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.390" end="00:38:35.830" style="s2"> These existential phenomenologists are trying to find out:</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.830" end="00:38:39.790" style="s2"> we have a big problem here, the belief systems are seriously going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.790" end="00:38:45.430" style="s2"> There is an indication that there is some individual responsibility,</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.430" end="00:38:47.220" style="s2"> whose nature is not clear.</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.220" end="00:38:51.960" style="s2"> If you live in a country where everyone has turned into a fascist killer, is that your fault?</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.960" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:58.580" style="s2"> It is not clear that an individual should be held responsible for the actions</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.580" end="00:39:02.980" style="s2"> of an entire country. But the country is made up of individuals, so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.980" end="00:39:06.030" style="s2"> is a complicated problem.</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.030" end="00:39:10.320" style="s2"> One of the tendencies of Western law is that you do not hold an individual responsible</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.320" end="00:39:15.600" style="s2"> for the actions of the group, even if he or she happens to be there</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.600" end="00:39:17.160" style="s2"> part of it.</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.160" end="00:39:20.250" style="s2"> But you can&#39;t ignore the fact that all those things were people.</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.250" end="00:39:25.400" style="s2"> Then you cannot ignore the fact that it was individuals who did the terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.400" end="00:39:26.510" style="s2"> those people were affected.</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.510" end="00:39:31.910" style="s2"> In Auschwitz, for example, one of the guards&#39; tricks was ...</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.910" end="00:39:36.130" style="s2"> they took the Jews out of the carriage, many had died in the carriage,</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.130" end="00:39:40.270" style="s2"> because they had so little space, so many suffocated. Whether the elderly died,</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.270" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2"> or the children died, and that was fine.</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:48.140" style="s2"> On the outside of the car, especially when it was winter, twenty degrees below zero,</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.140" end="00:39:52.150" style="s2"> people would freeze, but you had to get rid of that anyway,</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.150" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2"> so that was handy.</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:39:58.950" style="s2"> Then you took them to Auschwitz, where they all came out, speaking different languages,</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.950" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2"> without family, it couldn&#39;t be more miserable.</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:12.810" style="s2"> One trick was to get someone who wasn&#39;t broken enough to lift a big bag of wet salt,</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.810" end="00:40:17.710" style="s2"> about forty-five kilos. And have it carried from one side of the site to the other, and then back again.</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.710" end="00:40:18.990" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:40:18.990" end="00:40:20.490" style="s2"> Up and down.</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.490" end="00:40:24.510" style="s2"> You shouldn&#39;t see those camps as a football field.</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.510" end="00:40:26.210" style="s2"> They were entire cities.</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.210" end="00:40:30.860" style="s2"> They were big, they contained tens of thousands of people. And there is some guard</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.860" end="00:40:32.730" style="s2"> who likes that joke.</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.730" end="00:40:35.540" style="s2"> It&#39;s not just a few people who are like that.</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.540" end="00:40:39.640" style="s2"> We found out with the &quot;Stanford Prison Experiment,&quot; what every psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.640" end="00:40:45.140" style="s2"> as immoral because we actually discovered something with it, that if you are normal people</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.140" end="00:40:50.970" style="s2"> gives the chance to be fascist barbarians, thirty percent of the people will within six days.</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.970" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2"> What we learned was that social psychologists should not organize a Stanford Prison Experiment.</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:41:01.180" style="s2"> That is the wrong conclusion.</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.180" end="00:41:04.930" style="s2"> These phenomenologists were all concerned about this, thinking:</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.930" end="00:41:05.930" style="s2"> &quot;What can we do about it?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.930" end="00:41:13.850" style="s2"> They begin to think about how belief systems are constructed.</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.850" end="00:41:18.950" style="s2"> Their first thesis is that we are the reality we are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.950" end="00:41:23.790" style="s2"> as psychologists ... we must treat human experience as that reality.</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.790" end="00:41:28.970" style="s2"> The reality for you, from a phenomenological perspective, is all that you experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.970" end="00:41:35.530" style="s2"> is real. And they also assume that it is not possible for anything to be more real than that.</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.530" end="00:41:39.090" style="s2"> Your consciousness, whatever it may be, is real, and your dreams are real, and your emotions are real,</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.090" end="00:41:43.830" style="s2"> and your pain is real. Which is very helpful if you want to be sure</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.830" end="00:41:46.080" style="s2"> that you won&#39;t hurt people.</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.080" end="00:41:50.430" style="s2"> You have to think that maybe pain should be approached as a fundamental reality,</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.430" end="00:41:53.640" style="s2"> rather than as an epiphenomena of a material substance.</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.640" end="00:41:55.950" style="s2"> That is their primary perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.950" end="00:42:01.100" style="s2"> They took that over from Heidegger. Because Heidegger thought that Western philosophy had gone in the wrong direction,</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.100" end="00:42:07.650" style="s2"> three thousand years ago, because we didn&#39;t focus on being as such</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.650" end="00:42:09.370" style="s2"> as the basic mystery.</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.370" end="00:42:13.600" style="s2"> The basic mystery is: why is there anything at all?</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.600" end="00:42:19.100" style="s2"> And since there is something, an experience of being, what are the fundamental elements of it?</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.100" end="00:42:25.480" style="s2"> That&#39;s the phenomenological perspective, it&#39;s not the same as a scientific approach,</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.480" end="00:42:27.970" style="s2"> because it starts with a different starting point.</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.970" end="00:42:35.290" style="s2"> The scientific premise is that the objectively real elements of things</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.290" end="00:42:37.180" style="s2"> are the most real elements.</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.180" end="00:42:42.510" style="s2"> There is no point in complaining about that because it is an approach that is very good</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.510" end="00:42:46.920" style="s2"> works for many things, for example making hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.920" end="00:42:53.250" style="s2"> But it is also reasonable to think it may not be the whole truth,</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.250" end="00:42:54.250" style="s2"> and nothing but that.</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.250" end="00:42:59.280" style="s2"> You may also suspect the fact that we can make hydrogen bombs</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:04.190" style="s2"> indicates that there is something wrong with our basic belief systems.</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.190" end="00:43:05.810" style="s2"> Even though they are scientific.</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.810" end="00:43:08.710" style="s2"> That was something Heidegger was working on, even though he got involved</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.710" end="00:43:10.540" style="s2"> with the Nazis.</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.540" end="00:43:15.150" style="s2"> The phenomenologists tried to analyze experience as such. They formulated</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.150" end="00:43:18.210" style="s2"> some hypotheses, and made some observations.</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.210" end="00:43:24.130" style="s2"> The first is, we assume that your experience, that experience as such, is real.</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.130" end="00:43:25.650" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:43:25.650" end="00:43:33.020" style="s2"> That dreams are real, and pain is real, and objects that we can all perceive</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.020" end="00:43:36.230" style="s2"> being genuine doesn&#39;t mean they all belong in the same category.</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.230" end="00:43:41.840" style="s2"> My dreams don&#39;t belong in the same category as this table, because you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.840" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2"> no access to my dreams, you can access the table.</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2"> But that doesn&#39;t mean my dreams, my pain, and my feelings aren&#39;t real.</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:49.240" style="s2"> They are real.</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.240" end="00:43:55.450" style="s2"> That&#39;s the first, and notice that this is an assumption.</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.450" end="00:44:01.710" style="s2"> What they say is, “Let&#39;s pretend that is the case, and work from those assumptions,</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.710" end="00:44:04.350" style="s2"> and see what happens, see where we end up. ”</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.350" end="00:44:09.130" style="s2"> That&#39;s a perfectly reasonable way of working, because underneath every theory always lies</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.130" end="00:44:10.920" style="s2"> an assumption.</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.920" end="00:44:15.150" style="s2"> Otherwise, your theory would be one hundred percent correct and cover everything.</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.150" end="00:44:18.430" style="s2"> And that&#39;s not the case, so you have to make an assumption somewhere at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.430" end="00:44:24.450" style="s2"> and say, &quot;We&#39;re not going to question that, that&#39;s the starting point.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.450" end="00:44:30.210" style="s2"> You have to, because you don&#39;t know everything, you don&#39;t have a complete theory.</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.210" end="00:44:33.360" style="s2"> The phenomenologists don&#39;t like the idea that mind can be reduced to matter,</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.360" end="00:44:34.540" style="s2"> they don&#39;t play that game.</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.540" end="00:44:39.870" style="s2"> They are not playing the game that the subject is just an epiphenomena, and that the object is real.</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.870" end="00:44:41.450" style="s2"> They don&#39;t play that game either.</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.450" end="00:44:47.660" style="s2"> That&#39;s partly because, as Boss says, “Without a subject, there would be nothing to confront</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.660" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2"> to enter into objects and perceive them as such.</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:56.210" style="s2"> That implies that every object, everything that is objective, is objective only because it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.210" end="00:45:00.350" style="s2"> objectified by the subject, and thus the most subjective is what there is. ”</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.350" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2"> That&#39;s a radical statement, but think about this: when I look at the can of Coke,</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:16.690" style="s2"> can you say I see the object, then format how I could use it,</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.690" end="00:45:18.700" style="s2"> evaluate it, then use.</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.700" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2"> In fact, that&#39;s not what you do.</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:25.730" style="s2"> In fact, it is not at all obvious that you perceive objects.</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.730" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2"> If you think about it, people didn&#39;t see scientific objects until about 1500, 1450 AD.</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:35.010" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:35.010" end="00:45:40.870" style="s2"> Before that, there was no &quot;objective object.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.870" end="00:45:45.490" style="s2"> What we saw did not take that for granted, because then we would be direct</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.490" end="00:45:46.700" style="s2"> scientists have been.</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.700" end="00:45:51.450" style="s2"> George Kelly claimed that humans were scientists by nature, that we are always researching hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.450" end="00:45:53.980" style="s2"> and trying to refute and things like that.</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.980" end="00:45:58.420" style="s2"> That is an interesting theory, and in a way it is correct, but fundamentally it is incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.420" end="00:46:02.220" style="s2"> We are not scientists by nature, we are engineers by nature.</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.220" end="00:46:06.140" style="s2"> When we look at the world, we don&#39;t see objects and then make out their uses,</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.140" end="00:46:09.370" style="s2"> what we are actually seeing is usage.</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.370" end="00:46:14.820" style="s2"> For example, when I look at that Coke can, my visual system instantly activates my motor cortex.</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.820" end="00:46:15.820" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:15.820" end="00:46:19.870" style="s2"> I can even do that without consciously seeing the can, to a certain extent.</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.870" end="00:46:23.290" style="s2"> There are people with blind vision, I told you about that. They say</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.290" end="00:46:27.550" style="s2"> they can&#39;t see, but if you ask which hand is holding you up, they can tell you.</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.550" end="00:46:32.870" style="s2"> They may not be able to see, but they can see patterns from their visual system</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.870" end="00:46:34.260" style="s2"> through their motor cortex.</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.260" end="00:46:38.610" style="s2"> That&#39;s essentially how we interact with the world, according to Piaget.</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.610" end="00:46:43.290" style="s2"> We are physical beings, so what we see when we look around are not objects,</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.290" end="00:46:46.650" style="s2"> they are things we can use and things that get in the way.</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.650" end="00:46:50.450" style="s2"> That&#39;s a theory by JJ Gibson,</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.450" end="00:46:56.940" style="s2"> who wrote a great book about it entitled &quot;The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.940" end="00:47:00.340" style="s2"> His research was a form of pragmatism.</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.340" end="00:47:06.490" style="s2"> Pragmatists argue that things, including theories and observations, have a limited scope</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.490" end="00:47:14.340" style="s2"> of truth. And the limited scope of truth is determined by the relationship between your actions</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.340" end="00:47:15.340" style="s2"> and the results.</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.340" end="00:47:17.050" style="s2"> So I think this is a Coke can.</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.050" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2"> Is that what it is?</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:24.930" style="s2"> No, but that&#39;s good enough for me if I want to drink some Coke from it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.930" end="00:47:27.640" style="s2"> God knows what it could be.</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.640" end="00:47:35.120" style="s2"> If you go to communist China, and you start promoting these things, what is it?</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.120" end="00:47:38.770" style="s2"> This thing tells a story, what&#39;s the story?</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.770" end="00:47:41.050" style="s2"> Do you really need Coca Cola?</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.050" end="00:47:42.050" style="s2"> No.</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.050" end="00:47:44.300" style="s2"> It&#39;s frills, unnecessary luxury.</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.300" end="00:47:49.940" style="s2"> It&#39;s not even good for you, but it&#39;s buzzing and it&#39;s sweet</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.940" end="00:47:51.090" style="s2"> and you can buy it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.090" end="00:47:52.690" style="s2"> Why?</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.690" end="00:47:57.960" style="s2"> No matter how silly you are in your food choices, as far as our society is concerned</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.960" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2"> you have the right to poison yourself in whatever way you think suits you best.</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:07.660" style="s2"> So when you send this Coke can to communist China, this thing screams:</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.660" end="00:48:10.280" style="s2"> &quot;Silly individuality.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.280" end="00:48:12.970" style="s2"> And who knows how it undermines the state.</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.970" end="00:48:16.470" style="s2"> And if you don&#39;t think about that, you don&#39;t think.</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.470" end="00:48:19.130" style="s2"> Think what happens when we export cars.</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.130" end="00:48:21.750" style="s2"> What does a car say?</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.750" end="00:48:26.560" style="s2"> He says: “You can go wherever you want,</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.560" end="00:48:30.470" style="s2"> (that is nobody&#39;s business) in a dangerous, fast way. ”</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.470" end="00:48:36.210" style="s2"> If you wanna make a political statement, pack that thing and send it,</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.210" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2"> and everyone will say, &quot;I would really like to have a thing like that.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2"> And “poof,” that&#39;s how communism disappears.</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:49.980" style="s2"> Nothing is a better expression of individuality and capitalism than a private car.</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.980" end="00:48:54.520" style="s2"> You can even pollute the atmosphere and ruin the planet,</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.520" end="00:48:58.420" style="s2"> but you have to go to the shop around the corner by car to get your coke,</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.420" end="00:49:03.000" style="s2"> so get rid of that atmosphere.</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.000" end="00:49:06.771" style="s2"> So don&#39;t think what you see are just objects</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.771" end="00:49:07.820" style="s2"> because they are not.</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.820" end="00:49:12.860" style="s2"> I thought about this when I thought about people going to Graceland</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.860" end="00:49:15.390" style="s2"> to see Elvis&#39;s guitar.</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.390" end="00:49:22.110" style="s2"> What exactly is it that makes a guitar Elvis&#39; guitar?</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.110" end="00:49:28.040" style="s2"> It&#39;s not actually the guitar, because it&#39;s just there like any guitar.</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.040" end="00:49:29.551" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:49:29.551" end="00:49:34.440" style="s2"> You could take out that guitar and put in another guitar that&#39;s the same, and it still would</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.440" end="00:49:36.110" style="s2"> be Elvis&#39; guitar, because nobody would know.</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.110" end="00:49:40.280" style="s2"> You may think that&#39;s not Elvis&#39;s real guitar.</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.280" end="00:49:45.460" style="s2"> That&#39;s funny because you only think so when you think Elvis&#39;s guitar</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.460" end="00:49:49.790" style="s2"> that material thing is what you look at.</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.790" end="00:49:50.790" style="s2"> But that&#39;s not it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.790" end="00:49:53.740" style="s2"> That&#39;s just part of it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.740" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2"> That thing is part of a very layered reality.</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:04.840" style="s2"> The people who want to watch that look at it because of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.840" end="00:50:09.410" style="s2"> the magic it radiates, but that magic is real.</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.410" end="00:50:14.660" style="s2"> The magic is the effect of that guitar on the whole culture.</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.660" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2"> And those effects are also the guitar.</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:20.830" style="s2"> It&#39;s strange because when you go to look at Elvis&#39; guitar, you don&#39;t look at it</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.830" end="00:50:22.990" style="s2"> the guitar, but you watch the magic.</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.990" end="00:50:26.170" style="s2"> And strangely, the magic is real.</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.170" end="00:50:30.220" style="s2"> You cannot think like that if you are a materialist, because then you think so</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.220" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2"> the thing is the material. Go away.</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:39.570" style="s2"> I can tell you a different story. When the Europeans went to the South Pacific Islands,</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.570" end="00:50:42.550" style="s2"> had the original inhabitants, because they were few,</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.550" end="00:50:45.510" style="s2"> not a technologically developed society.</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.510" end="00:50:52.770" style="s2"> So if you were John, a dominant guy, in the culture of the Pacific Islands,</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.770" end="00:50:55.830" style="s2"> maybe you had a stone ax, a solid stone ax.</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.830" end="00:51:00.220" style="s2"> Go make an ax out of stone and see how long that takes, it&#39;s quite a bit of work.</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.220" end="00:51:04.430" style="s2"> So if you have a high status, if you&#39;ve worked your whole life to be on top of it</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.430" end="00:51:09.260" style="s2"> To get to the pyramid, you may have two axes. Then you are lucky.</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.260" end="00:51:14.320" style="s2"> You have two axes, which is more than any other animal, much more.</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.320" end="00:51:16.100" style="s2"> That is not trivial.</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.100" end="00:51:22.490" style="s2"> Then the missionaries come, open a shop, and what do they bring?</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.490" end="00:51:23.700" style="s2"> Steel axes.</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.700" end="00:51:29.580" style="s2"> That&#39;s a setback, you&#39;ve worked your whole life for stone axes,</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.580" end="00:51:34.710" style="s2"> making you head of the tribe. And then your child goes to the local missionaries,</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.710" end="00:51:38.730" style="s2"> and they say, &quot;We have a steel ax left, take it home.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.730" end="00:51:43.470" style="s2"> And it&#39;s so shocking, because not only did the missionaries have something that was much better</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.470" end="00:51:50.660" style="s2"> than the stone ax, it&#39;s like an airplane compared to a cart,</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.660" end="00:51:52.730" style="s2"> the difference is very big ...</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.730" end="00:51:57.550" style="s2"> But the missionaries don&#39;t even notice, that&#39;s the terrible thing about it.</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.550" end="00:52:01.890" style="s2"> They are giving away something that is about immeasurably valuable, because, “It&#39;s good,</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.890" end="00:52:06.310" style="s2"> we have some of them in storage, we just give some away. ”</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.310" end="00:52:07.400" style="s2"> That demoralizes a lot.</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.400" end="00:52:10.820" style="s2"> It was demoralizing for the original inhabitants.</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.820" end="00:52:17.090" style="s2"> Was it an ax that the missionaries gave away?</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.090" end="00:52:18.090" style="s2"> No.</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.090" end="00:52:22.150" style="s2"> That&#39;s what you think when you&#39;re a westerner with a bunch of axes, you think, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s an ax.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.150" end="00:52:23.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:52:23.400" end="00:52:26.320" style="s2"> It&#39;s much more than an ax, much more.</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.320" end="00:52:36.610" style="s2"> It is a weapon that can bring down an entire culture by accident.</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.610" end="00:52:42.930" style="s2"> One of the things that the phenomenologists made, this is an interesting statement. I did not know</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.930" end="00:52:43.930" style="s2"> that they claimed so.</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.930" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2"> It took me a long time to think this through because I thought I figured it out myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:51.260" style="s2"> but it turns out that it is very difficult to discover anything for yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.260" end="00:52:56.080" style="s2"> When I examined how the brain works from a neuropsychological perspective,</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.080" end="00:52:59.810" style="s2"> informed in large part by Jeffrey Gray (which we&#39;ll talk about later),</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.810" end="00:53:06.700" style="s2"> I noticed that you don&#39;t actually see things when you see something for the first time.</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.700" end="00:53:07.750" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:53:07.750" end="00:53:13.240" style="s2"> When you see something for the first time, you don&#39;t actually see it, you react to it.</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.240" end="00:53:15.740" style="s2"> You respond to it with your body.</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.740" end="00:53:17.650" style="s2"> I can give you an example.</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.650" end="00:53:22.210" style="s2"> You have a partner and a loyal relationship, but then you discover,</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.210" end="00:53:25.940" style="s2"> he tells you or you find out on his phone that he</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.940" end="00:53:27.210" style="s2"> having an affair.</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.210" end="00:53:31.980" style="s2"> You look at him and you think, &quot;What do you see?&quot; You think, &quot;You see the person.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.980" end="00:53:38.600" style="s2"> No, you don&#39;t see the person, that&#39;s incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.600" end="00:53:41.900" style="s2"> What you see is a big hole that you are going to fall into, and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.900" end="00:53:46.820" style="s2"> that you see it, but your body knows. Your blood pressure rises</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.820" end="00:53:48.740" style="s2"> and your heart rate starts to speed up and you sweat.</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.740" end="00:53:53.470" style="s2"> And the reason is that your body can see what you cannot see, and what it sees is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.470" end="00:53:57.810" style="s2"> what it cannot understand. It don&#39;t understand.</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.810" end="00:54:03.840" style="s2"> It sees the terrain behind the map. Because when I look at you, I actually see</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.840" end="00:54:08.320" style="s2"> my assumptions about you, and because you are polite and well behaved,</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.320" end="00:54:13.320" style="s2"> are you kind enough to behave in accordance with those assumptions,</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.320" end="00:54:16.710" style="s2"> so I don&#39;t actually have to look at you. And thank you very much for that.</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.710" end="00:54:22.660" style="s2"> For it is very difficult to look at people because they are terrifying and profound creatures.</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.660" end="00:54:26.550" style="s2"> And so everyone behaves so that we don&#39;t constantly scare each other.</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.550" end="00:54:27.550" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:54:27.550" end="00:54:31.600" style="s2"> If someone betrays you, then “poof,” the assumptions are gone.</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.600" end="00:54:33.690" style="s2"> Okay, what&#39;s up there?</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.690" end="00:54:36.350" style="s2"> God knows.</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.350" end="00:54:38.200" style="s2"> And that&#39;s what your body responds to.</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.200" end="00:54:44.690" style="s2"> And that&#39;s partly why the phenomenologists say we respond to meaning first, we don&#39;t respond</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.690" end="00:54:45.690" style="s2"> on objects.</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.690" end="00:54:48.080" style="s2"> It takes a long time to see an object.</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.080" end="00:54:51.770" style="s2"> For example, let&#39;s say this person betrayed you.</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.770" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2"> You thought you knew who he was, and you thought you knew who you were.</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:54:58.710" style="s2"> You were wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.710" end="00:55:02.280" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know who he is, and being so stupid it means that</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.280" end="00:55:06.940" style="s2"> you don&#39;t know who you are. And that you can&#39;t trust your memories with that person, and maybe none at all</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.940" end="00:55:09.890" style="s2"> memory of your intimate relationships.</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.890" end="00:55:11.750" style="s2"> And what about the future?</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.750" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2"> So when you look at that person, what do you see?</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:16.540" style="s2"> You see all of this as chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.540" end="00:55:18.660" style="s2"> You can see that.</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.660" end="00:55:24.270" style="s2"> And that chaos is the meaning behind your assumptions, and that&#39;s why the phenomenologists</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.270" end="00:55:26.940" style="s2"> would say, &quot;Meaning appears.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.940" end="00:55:30.770" style="s2"> And that&#39;s what we encounter in the first place.</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.770" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2"> That&#39;s intelligent.</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:34.550" style="s2"> And do you know what&#39;s really strange?</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.550" end="00:55:36.580" style="s2"> That&#39;s how your brain works.</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.580" end="00:55:42.370" style="s2"> And that&#39;s strange because you ... think about it: how do you define reality?</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.370" end="00:55:45.960" style="s2"> That&#39;s difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.960" end="00:55:51.100" style="s2"> I think most of you would define reality like Isaac Newton.</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.100" end="00:55:56.270" style="s2"> Or perhaps like Democritus, the first person to formulate the hypothesis of atoms.</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.270" end="00:56:01.460" style="s2"> In a Newtonian world everything consists of billiard balls.</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.460" end="00:56:06.210" style="s2"> They collide in a causal way and you can predict the consequences.</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.210" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2"> And if you take that far enough, you can make an entirely deterministic world appear.</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:12.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:12.040" end="00:56:18.380" style="s2"> A causes B, B causes C, always the same way, and everything is like a giant clock.</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.380" end="00:56:19.380" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:19.380" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2"> That&#39;s Newton&#39;s model.</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:24.890" style="s2"> And it was a clock model because at that time clocks very much</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.890" end="00:56:26.590" style="s2"> were impressive.</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.590" end="00:56:30.510" style="s2"> Clocks contributed a lot to the industrial revolution, and to medieval cities</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.510" end="00:56:34.600" style="s2"> put a lot of time and effort into their clocks. They loved those things.</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.600" end="00:56:35.720" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:35.720" end="00:56:39.010" style="s2"> They could keep track of how the planets moved.</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.010" end="00:56:42.750" style="s2"> The clock is very important, and when you think about an invention that changed the world,</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.750" end="00:56:44.550" style="s2"> the clock is an example of this.</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.550" end="00:56:46.810" style="s2"> Now we can measure time.</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.810" end="00:56:49.100" style="s2"> Everyone can measure time in the same way.</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.100" end="00:56:54.500" style="s2"> This is important. So the idea that the universe is like a clock, since the clock</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.500" end="00:56:57.830" style="s2"> predicting the universe is a very powerful idea.</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.830" end="00:57:03.740" style="s2"> It turns out to be wrong, because causality is a mess. Nobody really understands</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.740" end="00:57:08.341" style="s2"> and there are levels of analysis where causality, as we experience it,</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.341" end="00:57:10.060" style="s2"> does not seem to apply.</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.060" end="00:57:14.120" style="s2"> When you go to the subatomic level, there is a probability calculation. You can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.120" end="00:57:17.310" style="s2"> predict specific cases, and I don&#39;t think you can predict the future.</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.310" end="00:57:21.690" style="s2"> You can partially predict the future in a very limited way, for some purposes,</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.690" end="00:57:26.680" style="s2"> in a certain time span, and you can&#39;t even predict how long that time span will last.</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.680" end="00:57:28.100" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:57:28.100" end="00:57:32.890" style="s2"> Some things seem to be more stable, in more situations, and for longer periods than others,</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.890" end="00:57:37.590" style="s2"> but there is still… there is instability everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.590" end="00:57:39.670" style="s2"> It makes forecasting very difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.670" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2"> So that&#39;s one idea about reality, that&#39;s the idea you have.</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:49.560" style="s2"> That is the reality you received from your education.</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.560" end="00:57:51.840" style="s2"> The idea of ​​reality that you have received from your education.</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.840" end="00:57:57.450" style="s2"> Even though we know it&#39;s wrong. Einstein ended that world at the beginning of the nineteenth century,</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.450" end="00:58:00.119" style="s2"> along with the various people Einstein worked with.</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.119" end="00:58:04.420" style="s2"> That is gone, it is incorrect, and there are all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.420" end="00:58:09.609" style="s2"> very complex problems, such as how to model positive feedback processes. This puts you in chaos theory.</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.609" end="00:58:12.630" style="s2"> It is very difficult to model positive feedback processes.</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.630" end="00:58:16.730" style="s2"> They can get out of hand in fifty different ways, and you cannot predict them properly because they are dependent</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.730" end="00:58:18.980" style="s2"> of the original circumstances, et cetera.</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.980" end="00:58:24.190" style="s2"> So the deterministic world is incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.190" end="00:58:28.859" style="s2"> In part, I think we must have free will because we cannot act deterministically.</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.859" end="00:58:34.570" style="s2"> A deterministic system only works in a system that remains the same.</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.570" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2"> You can wind a clock, like those wind-up toys that can walk.</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:44.010" style="s2"> But if you put them in front of an abyss, they just keep going.</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.010" end="00:58:47.800" style="s2"> So when chasms are constantly appearing randomly before us, I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.800" end="00:58:51.030" style="s2"> how a deterministic system could guide us.</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.030" end="00:58:56.000" style="s2"> That implies that our knowledge, the knowledge we derive from the past,</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.000" end="00:58:58.590" style="s2"> sufficiently accurate to lead us causally to the future.</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.590" end="00:59:04.400" style="s2"> That&#39;s not right, it doesn&#39;t work that way, maybe that&#39;s why we have consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.400" end="00:59:07.830" style="s2"> Nobody knows, but that&#39;s a good theory, if there is a reason.</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.830" end="00:59:14.210" style="s2"> Anyway, now an alternative, a Darwinian alternative. The alternative is</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.210" end="00:59:18.580" style="s2"> that the world is a complex and dynamic place.</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.580" end="00:59:21.450" style="s2"> There are all kinds of strange things.</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.450" end="00:59:29.591" style="s2"> In essence it consists of patterns and patterns and patterns, that&#39;s what it is,</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.591" end="00:59:31.580" style="s2"> and they shift and dance around.</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.580" end="00:59:34.810" style="s2"> Then you throw something living in it.</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.810" end="00:59:40.310" style="s2"> It is programmed by DNA and has to keep up with the patterns that are constantly changing.</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.310" end="00:59:41.310" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:59:41.310" end="00:59:44.490" style="s2"> Some are somewhat stable, but they are quite fluid.</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.490" end="00:59:51.430" style="s2"> Then you put the DNA in there and that produces a million variants of whatever it may produce.</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.430" end="00:59:52.430" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:59:52.430" end="00:59:53.430" style="s2"> Most are incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.430" end="00:59:54.530" style="s2"> You are a mosquito and you lay a million eggs.</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.530" end="01:00:04.380" style="s2"> That&#39;s a million guesses as to how the future will be causally. The guess is</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.380" end="01:00:07.050" style="s2"> that the future will unfold so that this egg can become a mosquito.</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.050" end="01:00:11.290" style="s2"> Then you ask the question: &quot;How often is the mosquito that lays the eggs wrong?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.290" end="01:00:16.859" style="s2"> The answer is that if he lays a million eggs in his lifetime, I don&#39;t know how many eggs</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.859" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2"> mosquitoes lay but there are many, all those eggs will die except one.</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:25.890" style="s2"> If the mosquito is lucky.</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.890" end="01:00:29.080" style="s2"> You know that because we&#39;re not up to our knees in mosquitoes.</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.080" end="01:00:33.050" style="s2"> If it weren&#39;t, there would be mosquitoes everywhere, but luckily there aren&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.050" end="01:00:37.359" style="s2"> So what&#39;s the guess?</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.359" end="01:00:41.220" style="s2"> The guess is that mosquitoes will blend in with their environment.</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.220" end="01:00:44.570" style="s2"> Answer: Incorrect, with the exception of one in a million times.</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.570" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2"> How do you deal with that?</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:48.960" style="s2"> Millions of mosquitoes and millions of eggs make it work.</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.960" end="01:00:56.140" style="s2"> It means the basic hypothesis that the structure of the mosquito corresponds to the structure</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.140" end="01:01:07.030" style="s2"> of reality is 999,999 out of a million times incorrect.</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.030" end="01:01:13.130" style="s2"> You may think that is completely false, but it is enough to keep the mosquitoes alive.</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.130" end="01:01:19.491" style="s2"> This is continued over time, and what is actually being continued is</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.491" end="01:01:21.710" style="s2"> a massive amount of deaths.</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.710" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2"> Almost everything fails, 99.9 percent of the species that once lived there are extinct.</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:31.880" style="s2"> We ensure that a significant portion of the species that now exist</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.880" end="01:01:33.690" style="s2"> will die out.</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.690" end="01:01:38.980" style="s2"> Failure and death are the norm, and it will affect you all.</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.980" end="01:01:50.040" style="s2"> So if the underlying structure of reality is changeable, which it is. and the only way</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.040" end="01:01:55.660" style="s2"> what you can adapt to is generating variation of which most of it decays,</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.660" end="01:02:00.330" style="s2"> except those who can keep up with it more or less by accident, how do you define what is real?</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.330" end="01:02:10.490" style="s2"> A Darwinist would say, as would a pragmatist: you embody the real as best you can.</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.490" end="01:02:12.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:02:12.040" end="01:02:14.300" style="s2"> That is not very good.</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.300" end="01:02:17.700" style="s2"> Your reality is good enough for about eighty years.</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.700" end="01:02:21.950" style="s2"> And they also say it doesn&#39;t get any more real than that.</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.950" end="01:02:30.200" style="s2"> Reality is so complicated, a layered spectrum of patterns, that you cannot model</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.200" end="01:02:34.040" style="s2"> without death as the mechanism.</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.040" end="01:02:39.880" style="s2"> You are incapable of it, and even if you use death, it is almost just dying.</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.880" end="01:02:44.540" style="s2"> Even for the parts that are not just dying, which is a very small part, is the solution</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.540" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2"> not very good.</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:50.530" style="s2"> After eighty years you are gone, while there are three billion years of attempts</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.530" end="01:02:51.880" style="s2"> behind you. And that is the best you can do.</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.880" end="01:02:59.300" style="s2"> Maybe as a parrot you can live to be 150, and there seems to be an immortal jellyfish.</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.300" end="01:03:02.050" style="s2"> Typical that those damn jellyfish would be immortal.</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.050" end="01:03:06.900" style="s2"> So there is a completely different way of thinking about the real.</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.900" end="01:03:12.010" style="s2"> Nietzsche said, &quot;Truth serves life,&quot; that is a Darwinian idea.</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.010" end="01:03:17.780" style="s2"> Although he did not take it from Darwin, there is nothing more truthful than</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.780" end="01:03:20.380" style="s2"> which evolution reveals as the concept for reality.</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.380" end="01:03:23.040" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t get any more real than that for us.</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.040" end="01:03:25.550" style="s2"> That is not a Newtonian reality.</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.550" end="01:03:33.130" style="s2"> It is a multi-dimensional, patterned, chaotic reality that we try to keep up with.</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.130" end="01:03:44.330" style="s2"> What that could mean is that the implications for action that I derive from that phenomenon,</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.330" end="01:03:53.220" style="s2"> better indicate what it is than an objective analysis. Because your truth</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.220" end="01:03:58.920" style="s2"> the degree to which you embody truth becomes according to a Darwinian frame of mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.920" end="01:04:04.890" style="s2"> entirely determined by your success in life and reproduction.</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.890" end="01:04:08.580" style="s2"> That&#39;s it, and there&#39;s nothing under it.</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.580" end="01:04:11.390" style="s2"> Maybe so, but if you&#39;re a Darwinian, that&#39;s it.</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.390" end="01:04:16.510" style="s2"> All in all, I think Darwin is right and Newton is not. We also know</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.510" end="01:04:18.140" style="s2"> that Newton is wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.140" end="01:04:23.310" style="s2"> Darwinian thinking is more complicated than we thought because you know what epigenetics is?</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.310" end="01:04:24.310" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:04:24.310" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2"> How many of you know that?</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:32.060" style="s2"> That&#39;s pretty good, so your biological education is superseding your historical education.</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.060" end="01:04:34.210" style="s2"> How many people don&#39;t know what epigenetics is?</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.210" end="01:04:36.520" style="s2"> That doesn&#39;t matter, as it is relatively new.</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.520" end="01:04:41.730" style="s2"> It turns out that your parents&#39; experiences can change their genetic structure,</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.730" end="01:04:45.110" style="s2"> in such a way that it changes your genetic structure.</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.110" end="01:04:48.970" style="s2"> That is something we did not expect, that much is certain.</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.970" end="01:04:53.859" style="s2"> Nobody knows what the ultimate consequences will be, but it seems</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.859" end="01:04:59.770" style="s2"> that the evolutionary narrative is more than random production and natural selection.</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.770" end="01:05:03.010" style="s2"> There&#39;s more than that, and who knows how much.</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.010" end="01:05:11.560" style="s2"> So when the phenomenologists say that we respond to meaning first, that begs the question:</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.560" end="01:05:12.960" style="s2"> &quot;Is the meaning real?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.960" end="01:05:18.250" style="s2"> And that raises another question, namely, &quot;What do you mean by really?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.250" end="01:05:23.090" style="s2"> and that raises another question: &quot;Newtonian real or Darwinian real?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.090" end="01:05:30.170" style="s2"> Newton is not right, so Darwin and Darwinian really are left, more real than that</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.170" end="01:05:34.200" style="s2"> it will not be.</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.200" end="01:05:40.030" style="s2"> If a limited entity tries to conceptualize a complex totality, it will never be able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.030" end="01:05:44.231" style="s2"> embody more than a limited representation thereof. And that won&#39;t be very good</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.231" end="01:05:50.530" style="s2"> but the best it can be, and it will not be more true than that.</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.530" end="01:05:54.980" style="s2"> The phenomenologists have this strange idea that we perceive meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.980" end="01:05:58.300" style="s2"> And that&#39;s how your brain functions.</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.300" end="01:06:02.340" style="s2"> You first perceive meaning, and then you change it with a lot of work into the perception of an object.</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.340" end="01:06:03.830" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:06:03.830" end="01:06:07.640" style="s2"> Who knows how much exploration you have to do before you are able to do so.</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.640" end="01:06:14.610" style="s2"> How long do you think it takes a child to learn how to handle their pacifier before giving birth</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.610" end="01:06:17.230" style="s2"> build accurate representation of the teat?</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.230" end="01:06:22.060" style="s2"> He&#39;ll chew it like crazy, take it out of his mouth, look at it, turn it over,</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.060" end="01:06:24.320" style="s2"> and hit things.</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.320" end="01:06:29.340" style="s2"> He has to do all that, including the physical interaction.</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.340" end="01:06:33.700" style="s2"> Experimenting with the thing in different situations creates &quot;object permanence.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.700" end="01:06:38.560" style="s2"> He has to do all that before he can see the thing.</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.560" end="01:06:47.730" style="s2"> Early artificial intelligence researchers, who were under the influence of the behaviorists, said the object</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.730" end="01:06:51.740" style="s2"> a given, and that they could treat the brain as if it didn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.740" end="01:06:54.260" style="s2"> The object is just there and you can see the world.</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.260" end="01:06:56.410" style="s2"> That turned out to be very incorrect.</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.410" end="01:06:59.320" style="s2"> It is difficult to make a computer see the world.</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.320" end="01:07:04.020" style="s2"> It turns out that you have to put them in bodies before they can.</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.020" end="01:07:07.640" style="s2"> Because you cannot perceive the world without a body.</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.640" end="01:07:10.880" style="s2"> Perception is for physical action.</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.880" end="01:07:15.950" style="s2"> Without the framework within which ... it is in fact a Piagetian idea.</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.950" end="01:07:22.600" style="s2"> This is a pattern, this thing, and the pattern exist at different levels, including the level of advertising,</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.600" end="01:07:27.110" style="s2"> your memories of Coke, and all the “jingles” (commercials) you know.</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.110" end="01:07:32.900" style="s2"> But this, when I look at that, the pattern comes to my retina, and the pattern is a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.900" end="01:07:34.670" style="s2"> because it is permanent over time.</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.670" end="01:07:37.590" style="s2"> It&#39;s not like smoke disappearing.</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.590" end="01:07:39.700" style="s2"> It stays here over time.</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.700" end="01:07:44.170" style="s2"> That comes on my retina, and my retina maps it on my hand.</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.170" end="01:07:46.420" style="s2"> That&#39;s the Coke can.</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.420" end="01:07:52.250" style="s2"> The Coke can is all of this.</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.250" end="01:07:55.190" style="s2"> You could say, &quot;That&#39;s not what it is, because it&#39;s made of aluminum.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.190" end="01:08:00.860" style="s2"> Yes, yes, it is made of aluminum, but that&#39;s just one aspect of what it is,</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.860" end="01:08:01.860" style="s2"> and it is not necessarily the most important aspect.</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.860" end="01:08:02.860" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:08:02.860" end="01:08:04.460" style="s2"> Because it could also be made of plastic</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.460" end="01:08:08.599" style="s2"> and what difference would that make?</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.599" end="01:08:13.180" style="s2"> It&#39;s strange when you think about it.</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.180" end="01:08:17.230" style="s2"> People argue that meaning is an epiphenomenon, as if there is no real meaning, and the universe</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.230" end="01:08:24.069" style="s2"> would be some kind of dead thing. And if we all died out tomorrow, there would be nothing but a collection of meaningless marbles</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.069" end="01:08:26.770" style="s2"> that would move in space.</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.770" end="01:08:30.410" style="s2"> First of all, even this isn&#39;t true, who knows what would be if nothing was around</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.410" end="01:08:32.279" style="s2"> to perceive it.</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.279" end="01:08:38.819" style="s2"> The physicists say we should see it more as a gigantic potentially fluctuating quantum field,</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.819" end="01:08:43.820" style="s2"> that might not even turn into stars and planets until someone is there to see it.</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.820" end="01:08:47.520" style="s2"> You might think that&#39;s ridiculous, but if you think about it for a moment, you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.520" end="01:08:49.770" style="s2"> that there is something in it.</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.770" end="01:08:53.730" style="s2"> You are the one who specifies the level of analysis.</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.730" end="01:08:58.640" style="s2"> The way you look at the world, you don&#39;t see atoms, you don&#39;t see subatomic</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.640" end="01:09:00.670" style="s2"> particles, and you don&#39;t see small stones.</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.670" end="01:09:05.370" style="s2"> You see things the size of a planet when you look into space, and you see it</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.370" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2"> at some point in time.</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.839" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2"> Maybe your refresh rate is about sixty hertz, so what you&#39;re seeing is the universe</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:18.670" style="s2"> divided into sixty hertz layers. And you think that&#39;s real.</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.670" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2"> But so is the rest, also the great expanding time, from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:29.100" style="s2"> You don&#39;t see all that, but it is there.</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.100" end="01:09:31.230" style="s2"> All those things are there at the same time.</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.230" end="01:09:33.250" style="s2"> What is the whole?</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.250" end="01:09:38.790" style="s2"> The physicists seem to tell us that it is a set of quantum potential,</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.790" end="01:09:43.370" style="s2"> which is only realized until there is something about consciousness that interacts with it.</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.370" end="01:09:50.520" style="s2"> A lot of meaning appears, and children are</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.520" end="01:09:55.260" style="s2"> so fascinating, because meaning appears very visibly to them.</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.260" end="01:09:58.030" style="s2"> That&#39;s why they always walk around like this.</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.030" end="01:10:02.770" style="s2"> It&#39;s a lot of fun to watch children because they bring you back in touch with that feeling.</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.770" end="01:10:04.820" style="s2"> Children have to pay you so that you don&#39;t throw them out the window.</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.820" end="01:10:08.470" style="s2"> They are very annoying, they always cry, they are completely useless,</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.470" end="01:10:12.290" style="s2"> they just lie there and do nothing, and they wake you up at three in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.290" end="01:10:14.630" style="s2"> to taunt you.</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.630" end="01:10:17.510" style="s2"> Since you are selfish and mean, you need something in return.</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.510" end="01:10:19.000" style="s2"> So they smile at you.</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.000" end="01:10:20.630" style="s2"> But they also do other things.</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.630" end="01:10:25.489" style="s2"> They&#39;re really comical so it&#39;s a lot of fun to watch and play with them.</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.489" end="01:10:30.400" style="s2"> But one of the things they really do when they&#39;re with you is remove your blinders.</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:31.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:10:31.400" end="01:10:35.480" style="s2"> You go into the woods with a two and a half child, which is very annoying.</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.480" end="01:10:38.140" style="s2"> It just randomly wanders.</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.140" end="01:10:41.140" style="s2"> You have no goal.</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.140" end="01:10:44.610" style="s2"> Nothing purposeful is going to happen to a two and a half child, but</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.610" end="01:10:48.560" style="s2"> it does have something, because it frees your mind from purposeful limitation.</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.560" end="01:10:51.460" style="s2"> You can see how a two and a half child looks at all those things where you</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.460" end="01:10:54.450" style="s2"> haven&#39;t looked at it in twenty years because you&#39;ve looked at it before and are now using your memory.</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.450" end="01:10:55.750" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:10:55.750" end="01:10:58.280" style="s2"> Then you think, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s really cool.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.280" end="01:11:01.460" style="s2"> They bring you something, and they tell you it&#39;s cool.</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.460" end="01:11:04.570" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s a shimmering piece of aluminum from chewing gum paper.</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.570" end="01:11:08.950" style="s2"> You think it is a chew paper because that is what you see when you look at it.</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.950" end="01:11:12.840" style="s2"> You have already built up a representation of a chewing gum paper, and you just put that on it.</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.840" end="01:11:14.370" style="s2"> That is not what the child sees.</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.370" end="01:11:16.680" style="s2"> Who knows what they see.</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.680" end="01:11:21.070" style="s2"> Maybe how the light is reflected by the aluminum like a prism, and how it shimmers.</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.070" end="01:11:24.390" style="s2"> Or how cool it is that it can be folded, and how light it is.</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.390" end="01:11:27.481" style="s2"> They look at it like that, and I think that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.481" end="01:11:31.640" style="s2"> their cortex is not yet very developed. They haven&#39;t built the restrictive structures yet</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.640" end="01:11:35.980" style="s2"> that prevent them from seeing meaning appear.</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.980" end="01:11:38.510" style="s2"> You may think, &quot;Is there evidence for that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.510" end="01:11:43.730" style="s2"> In fact, there is quite a bit of evidence for that.</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.730" end="01:11:48.640" style="s2"> One piece of evidence is that if you remove a cat&#39;s brain,</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.640" end="01:11:53.130" style="s2"> leaving behind only the hypothalamus and spinal cord, becoming “hyper-exploratory”. She walks around</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.130" end="01:11:54.460" style="s2"> like everything is interesting.</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.460" end="01:11:57.750" style="s2"> That&#39;s strange behavior for something without a brain.</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.750" end="01:12:02.360" style="s2"> You would think that if you run out of brains, nothing would be interesting.</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.360" end="01:12:04.880" style="s2"> It depends on how much of your brain you have.</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.880" end="01:12:06.850" style="s2"> There are people who have experienced that.</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.850" end="01:12:12.460" style="s2"> There was a famous case of a conductor who suffered severe brain damage.</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.460" end="01:12:17.850" style="s2"> His hypocampus was more or less broken, causing him to lose information from his short-term memory to his</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.850" end="01:12:19.960" style="s2"> long-term memory.</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.960" end="01:12:26.900" style="s2"> He wrote articles, very extensive diary reports.</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.900" end="01:12:36.510" style="s2"> He kept writing, &quot;It&#39;s like seeing everything for the first time.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.510" end="01:12:37.510" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:37.510" end="01:12:39.200" style="s2"> He walked around in a constant state of wonder.</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.200" end="01:12:40.730" style="s2"> His wife came to visit him.</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.730" end="01:12:42.810" style="s2"> He couldn&#39;t remember anything that had happened.</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.810" end="01:12:47.290" style="s2"> He was shocked to see her because he didn&#39;t see his memories.</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.290" end="01:12:50.710" style="s2"> He said, &quot;It&#39;s like seeing you for the first time.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.710" end="01:12:54.280" style="s2"> And it was, he saw her for the first time.</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.280" end="01:12:58.970" style="s2"> Access to the restrictive structures that used to direct his attention was gone.</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.970" end="01:13:03.170" style="s2"> It was an interesting case because now and then he played the piano.</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.170" end="01:13:09.360" style="s2"> He had an epileptic fit and then he could play like he used to play.</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.360" end="01:13:13.400" style="s2"> It was as if he had to switch brain modes and the switching mechanism was damaged.</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.400" end="01:13:18.530" style="s2"> He had to get a little attack and then he could play Beethoven sonatas like crazy.</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.530" end="01:13:19.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:13:19.960" end="01:13:23.989" style="s2"> Then he had a minor seizure and came back:</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.989" end="01:13:26.290" style="s2"> &quot;As if I see everything for the first time.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.290" end="01:13:31.070" style="s2"> I think psychedelics were so attractive to people in the 1960s,</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.070" end="01:13:36.040" style="s2"> and for people since the beginning of time, because in a sense they take care of that.</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.040" end="01:13:37.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:13:37.040" end="01:13:40.350" style="s2"> Suddenly the representations of your memory are gone.</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.350" end="01:13:41.790" style="s2"> What do you see then?</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.790" end="01:13:45.000" style="s2"> God knows, but it&#39;s not what you expect.</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.000" end="01:13:55.170" style="s2"> And maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s there, but maybe that&#39;s not.</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.170" end="01:14:10.040" style="s2"> I&#39;m going to summarize this.</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.040" end="01:14:13.239" style="s2"> What do you think drives people to extreme forms of pathology?</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.239" end="01:14:17.290" style="s2"> That could be your pathology: your misery, your suffering, and all that.</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.290" end="01:14:25.560" style="s2"> Or it could be your social psychopathology, your murderous desire to destroy.</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.560" end="01:14:32.730" style="s2"> Now a phenomenological theory.</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.730" end="01:14:36.250" style="s2"> The “terror management” theory is that you have to build these structures in your head</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.250" end="01:14:40.430" style="s2"> to protect yourself from agony. So what the terror management theorists are basically saying is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.430" end="01:14:43.310" style="s2"> the more blind you are, the better off you are.</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.310" end="01:14:46.380" style="s2"> That is also what the “positive illusion” thinkers think.</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.380" end="01:14:48.940" style="s2"> The phenomenologists approached this in a different way.</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.940" end="01:14:55.170" style="s2"> They said the meaning that is constantly manifesting is nourishing and revitalizing,</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.170" end="01:14:59.090" style="s2"> although it is also so powerful that it can blow you over.</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.090" end="01:15:01.030" style="s2"> It&#39;s dangerous to mess around with it.</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.030" end="01:15:04.720" style="s2"> It&#39;s like the burning bush.</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.720" end="01:15:07.840" style="s2"> You have to build a structure to deal with it because you have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.840" end="01:15:10.590" style="s2"> limit it to something you can handle.</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.590" end="01:15:16.510" style="s2"> But you have to build this structure correctly and precisely so that the meaning manifests itself</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.510" end="01:15:22.900" style="s2"> can be shaped by you into a world, conceptually and practically. Which ensures that</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.900" end="01:15:29.000" style="s2"> the remaining meaning can appear in a way that is revitalizing enough,</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.000" end="01:15:33.250" style="s2"> so that you don&#39;t get corrupted in such a way that you become genocidal.</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.250" end="01:15:39.130" style="s2"> That&#39;s a good theory, and that&#39;s what the phenomenologists were after.</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.130" end="01:15:46.130" style="s2"> That&#39;s why the existentialists and phenomenologists say:</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.130" end="01:15:50.740" style="s2"> “Don&#39;t lie to yourself about what is manifesting to you.</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.740" end="01:15:53.719" style="s2"> Don&#39;t use language instrumentally. ”</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.719" end="01:15:55.260" style="s2"> Why?</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.260" end="01:16:01.150" style="s2"> Because if you do that and twist the structures you use to interpret the world,</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.150" end="01:16:07.680" style="s2"> the world will become twisted for you and what will reveal itself is horror.</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.680" end="01:16:15.150" style="s2"> And if nothing but horror appears to you all the time, you will not be okay.</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.150" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2"> Because you can&#39;t handle such pressure.</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:23.190" style="s2"> You will become bitter and resentful.</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.190" end="01:16:28.270" style="s2"> Everything around you will fall apart because you are not modeling reality</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.270" end="01:16:30.690" style="s2"> in a way that positive meaning can appear.</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.690" end="01:16:33.450" style="s2"> You will fail and become resentful.</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.450" end="01:16:35.100" style="s2"> And you will become bitter.</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.100" end="01:16:39.790" style="s2"> Then you will look for someone to hurt, and you will have plenty of justifications there</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.790" end="01:16:42.250" style="s2"> have for.</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.250" end="01:16:48.190" style="s2"> And worse, and this is a Jungian contribution to this idea: this will not happen all at once,</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.190" end="01:16:53.090" style="s2"> it will happen as a consequence of a hundred thousand micro-decisions that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.090" end="01:16:59.050" style="s2"> hardly notices. Where you can be sincere about something or not, in a miniscule way that seems almost irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.050" end="01:17:00.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:17:00.420" end="01:17:06.150" style="s2"> But the consequence of doing that for a longer period of time, for example three hundred thousand decisions,</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.150" end="01:17:11.340" style="s2"> is that you make yourself a kind of monster that you couldn&#39;t face in the mirror.</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.340" end="01:17:14.800" style="s2"> And one of the things the phenomenologists would tell you too,</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.800" end="01:17:20.800" style="s2"> and Jung also said this is, &quot;You probably are that kind of monster too.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.800" end="01:17:25.800" style="s2"> If you want to deal with that, you have to start taking things seriously.</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.800" end="01:17:29.760" style="s2"> There are two things you should take seriously.</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.760" end="01:17:38.239" style="s2"> One is the meaning that appears to you, and the other is whether you are sincere</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.239" end="01:17:41.530" style="s2"> when you interact with that meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.530" end="01:17:47.110" style="s2"> The ultimate consequence of that is your health, the health of your family</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.110" end="01:17:56.180" style="s2"> and your society, the health of the whole society rests on it.</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.180" end="01:18:00.200" style="s2"> The way the world develops is the end result of the choices we all make,</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.200" end="01:18:01.730" style="s2"> all those little micro-decisions.</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.730" end="01:18:08.170" style="s2"> They are like ripples of water in a lake. So if you do something small that isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.170" end="01:18:13.130" style="s2"> what you know you shouldn&#39;t do, you are actually distorting the fabric of reality.</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.130" end="01:18:18.750" style="s2"> And that&#39;s very interesting because we now know what happens when you do that.</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.750" end="01:18:23.430" style="s2"> What happens is we end up with the Nazis and the Communists and the hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.430" end="01:18:26.460" style="s2"> And we have not yet escaped that.</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.460" end="01:18:31.120" style="s2"> Hopefully that will happen, but it won&#39;t happen if people don&#39;t learn anything from the twentieth century.</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.120" end="01:18:36.730" style="s2"></p>
