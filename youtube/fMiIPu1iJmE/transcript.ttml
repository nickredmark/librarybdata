<p begin="00:00:05.459" end="00:00:10.630" style="s2">Thomas thank you very much for making</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.509" end="00:00:12.310" style="s2">the time to speak to me you wrote an</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.630" end="00:00:14.320" style="s2">article that was incredibly well</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.310" end="00:00:17.560" style="s2">researched I think it was about 39 pages</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.320" end="00:00:19.810" style="s2">in total that has been very very popular</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.560" end="00:00:22.359" style="s2">I think I&#39;ve been shared over 24 million</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.810" end="00:00:24.130" style="s2">times now in the last few days would you</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.359" end="00:00:25.480" style="s2">just be able to sort of summarize what</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.130" end="00:00:27.159" style="s2">do you think is the main takeaway from</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.480" end="00:00:31.960" style="s2">that article that people need to know</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.159" end="00:00:35.650" style="s2">yes sure the number of cases of coroner</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.960" end="00:00:38.200" style="s2">virus is exploding globally people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.650" end="00:00:40.600" style="s2">realize that&#39;s happening because this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.200" end="00:00:42.940" style="s2">exponential which means that at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.600" end="00:00:48.010" style="s2">beginning it&#39;s very slow and suddenly it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.940" end="00:00:50.290" style="s2">explodes that is why most countries have</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.010" end="00:00:52.210" style="s2">not taking the measures that they needed</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.290" end="00:00:53.890" style="s2">to take the moment to take the measures</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.210" end="00:00:57.340" style="s2">it&#39;s when it&#39;s here it&#39;s not only it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.890" end="00:00:59.920" style="s2">here at that point the outbreak has</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.340" end="00:01:05.230" style="s2">already exploded so what you need so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.920" end="00:01:08.260" style="s2">author of the article was to explain</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.230" end="00:01:10.180" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen which is if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.260" end="00:01:12.700" style="s2">don&#39;t do anything the cases are going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.180" end="00:01:15.850" style="s2">explode once they explode they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.700" end="00:01:19.210" style="s2">to overrun the healthcare system once</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.850" end="00:01:23.020" style="s2">they do the mortality rate of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.210" end="00:01:26.860" style="s2">coroner virus will explode probably up</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.020" end="00:01:30.280" style="s2">to 10x 10 times higher mortality plus</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.860" end="00:01:32.650" style="s2">all the other comorbidities meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.280" end="00:01:36.310" style="s2">if you have a heart attack but the ICU</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.650" end="00:01:42.010" style="s2">is collapsed you&#39;re gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.310" end="00:01:44.430" style="s2">and so what are we to do against to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.010" end="00:01:47.680" style="s2">the to prevent that from happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.430" end="00:01:49.650" style="s2">reduce our social contact as much as</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.680" end="00:01:54.400" style="s2">possible it&#39;s called social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.650" end="00:01:58.119" style="s2">so that instead of having a huge spike a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.400" end="00:02:00.970" style="s2">huge peak we little by little increase</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.119" end="00:02:03.909" style="s2">this illness so that a we don&#39;t overrun</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.970" end="00:02:06.189" style="s2">the healthcare system and me as many</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.909" end="00:02:08.470" style="s2">people as possible can have it not today</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.189" end="00:02:09.399" style="s2">but in a year and a year and a half when</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.470" end="00:02:12.160" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.399" end="00:02:13.580" style="s2">Thomas can I ask your your background</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.160" end="00:02:15.470" style="s2">because I understand you</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.580" end="00:02:16.820" style="s2">in the media not a journalist how long</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.470" end="00:02:21.230" style="s2">have to meet you to write and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.820" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">your background for doing this so I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.230" end="00:02:26.630" style="s2">spent before I wrote it I had spent</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:34.330" style="s2">around two weeks researching this around</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.630" end="00:02:37.100" style="s2">for four to five hours a day and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.330" end="00:02:38.470" style="s2">your underlying question is why should</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.100" end="00:02:41.630" style="s2">people listen to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.470" end="00:02:48.650" style="s2">and I think the answer is they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.630" end="00:02:50.570" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t listen to me I I am NOT</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.650" end="00:02:53.240" style="s2">in the PDL module just I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.570" end="00:02:55.250" style="s2">biologist what I&#39;ve done is gather all</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.240" end="00:02:58.580" style="s2">the research from all these different</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.250" end="00:03:01.610" style="s2">places and put it in one place so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.580" end="00:03:05.000" style="s2">people can understand it you should</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.610" end="00:03:07.700" style="s2">judge the article based on the data and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.000" end="00:03:10.910" style="s2">the arguments and sources not on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.700" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s me it so happens that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.910" end="00:03:18.700" style="s2">have a couple of background elements</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">that have helped me put this together</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.700" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">I&#39;m an engineer I have two masters of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">science so I&#39;m very very close to all</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:27.860" style="s2">things data analysis and statistics I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">worked as a consultant where I had to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.860" end="00:03:32.120" style="s2">get into companies and understand them</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:35.450" style="s2">within two to three weeks so I&#39;m very I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.120" end="00:03:36.530" style="s2">have experience going deep into</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.450" end="00:03:36.860" style="s2">understanding a problem very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.530" end="00:03:39.470" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.860" end="00:03:42.440" style="s2">I also created some viral applications</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.470" end="00:03:45.530" style="s2">that exploded to up to 20 million users</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.440" end="00:03:48.860" style="s2">so I am acquainted with the analytics of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.530" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">virality I think these are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.860" end="00:03:53.769" style="s2">reasons why I was able to put these two</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:56.630" style="s2">together but people shouldn&#39;t see me as</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.769" end="00:03:58.580" style="s2">the person making the arguments but</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.630" end="00:04:03.440" style="s2">rather making the Assembly of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.580" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">arguments and so we talk a lot on on</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.440" end="00:04:05.989" style="s2">this channel we look very closely at</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:07.910" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.989" end="00:04:11.090" style="s2">what are the failures in sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.910" end="00:04:13.070" style="s2">and especially about how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.090" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">better how do we up regulate our</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.070" end="00:04:17.330" style="s2">discernment and our sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting that you seem to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.330" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">be doing something that so far the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:25.850" style="s2">mainstream media hasn&#39;t done to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:27.290" style="s2">level why do you think that is well the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.850" end="00:04:31.220" style="s2">median and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.290" end="00:04:34.870" style="s2">and politicians and and and I care about</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.220" end="00:04:38.270" style="s2">both but I came more about politicians I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.870" end="00:04:40.130" style="s2">think I think one of the key mental</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.270" end="00:04:44.420" style="s2">frameworks that most people are lack is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.130" end="00:04:45.890" style="s2">exponential growth the the my job I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.420" end="00:04:47.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t mention that in but in my job</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.890" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">both in the viral applications but but</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.480" end="00:04:52.010" style="s2">in tech in general you&#39;re going for</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:53.690" style="s2">exponential growth and you understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.010" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">the mechanics of exponents for growth so</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.690" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">when you see that something is growing</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:00.410" style="s2">at 20% percent or 30 percent day over</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:02.630" style="s2">day you freak out you&#39;re super happy if</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.410" end="00:05:05.480" style="s2">it&#39;s your product or you&#39;re super super</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.630" end="00:05:06.650" style="s2">super scared if it&#39;s a virus but because</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.480" end="00:05:08.390" style="s2">you understand what&#39;s gonna happen you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.650" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">know week two weeks three weeks three</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.390" end="00:05:13.940" style="s2">months four months so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:15.050" style="s2">what that&#39;s one of the key issues why</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.940" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">people didn&#39;t understand what was going</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.050" end="00:05:23.270" style="s2">to happen there&#39;s also an issue of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:27.170" style="s2">connecting the dots here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.270" end="00:05:30.910" style="s2">not just one part this is a puzzle and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.170" end="00:05:32.480" style="s2">you need to pull it together and most</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.910" end="00:05:35.480" style="s2">journalists especially when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.480" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">covering news they are not trained to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.480" end="00:05:39.410" style="s2">put all the pieces together I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:41.690" style="s2">is you need to put the pieces together</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.410" end="00:05:43.220" style="s2">of hey this is not China anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.690" end="00:05:45.260" style="s2">these other countries hey it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.220" end="00:05:47.030" style="s2">growing exponentially hey the only way</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.260" end="00:05:49.940" style="s2">to stop this is with social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.030" end="00:05:51.620" style="s2">and so on and so forth so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.940" end="00:05:53.750" style="s2">journalists do that really well but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.620" end="00:05:56.050" style="s2">these are usually like research pieces</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.750" end="00:05:58.780" style="s2">that take months not not any news cycle</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.050" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">that&#39;s my guess I have no idea here I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.780" end="00:06:09.110" style="s2">think on the politician side my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:11.630" style="s2">and again it is a guess they they are</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.110" end="00:06:13.190" style="s2">making decisions with an unclear</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.630" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">understanding of what the objective is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.190" end="00:06:21.050" style="s2">and what the cost benefits are and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:24.050" style="s2">give an example right now you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.050" end="00:06:26.300" style="s2">country that just friends that just said</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.050" end="00:06:27.650" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to be doing heavy</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.300" end="00:06:31.220" style="s2">social distancing and you have another</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.650" end="00:06:33.880" style="s2">one the UK which is saying that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.220" end="00:06:35.800" style="s2">gonna have herd immunity you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.880" end="00:06:37.720" style="s2">it sounds crazy that two countries are</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.800" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">so close to each other geographically</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.720" end="00:06:42.940" style="s2">and are only a part in a few days in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:45.810" style="s2">number of cases have a drastically</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.940" end="00:06:49.210" style="s2">different decision-making process right</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.810" end="00:06:50.950" style="s2">and my guess is by hearing different</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.210" end="00:06:53.890" style="s2">people in these different countries is</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.950" end="00:06:57.640" style="s2">that they&#39;re not talking apples to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.890" end="00:06:59.950" style="s2">apples in the British government they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.640" end="00:07:03.040" style="s2">saying oh it&#39;s too expensive it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.950" end="00:07:05.500" style="s2">hard to make to do social distancing so</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.040" end="00:07:08.020" style="s2">let&#39;s just run this thing slow it down a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.500" end="00:07:10.810" style="s2">little bit but run this the French are</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.020" end="00:07:12.670" style="s2">saying oh and we realize now this is bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.810" end="00:07:14.530" style="s2">that&#39;s let&#39;s slow this down as much as</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.670" end="00:07:18.490" style="s2">possible but really the question that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.530" end="00:07:19.230" style="s2">both of these should be asking is what</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.490" end="00:07:21.940" style="s2">is our objective</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.230" end="00:07:26.010" style="s2">do we want to minimize deaths do we want</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.940" end="00:07:29.950" style="s2">to minimize the ROI of eight years lived</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.010" end="00:07:31.300" style="s2">versus cost of year lived and then and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.950" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">then what are the measures that have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.300" end="00:07:38.230" style="s2">highest cost benefit so for example for</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:38.770" style="s2">it might be that doing a lock down right</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.230" end="00:07:43.410" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.770" end="00:07:46.270" style="s2">for two weeks and then slowly releasing</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.410" end="00:07:48.490" style="s2">social distancing measures has the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.270" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">optimal alright because it gets your</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.490" end="00:07:55.030" style="s2">curve it stops your curve starts going</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:58.990" style="s2">down and when you are you&#39;re going down</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:08:01.080" style="s2">you can slowly release social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.990" end="00:08:03.640" style="s2">measures so that it&#39;s controlled right</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.080" end="00:08:05.770" style="s2">but for you to make that decision of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.640" end="00:08:09.880" style="s2">whether you want to do this or like in</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.770" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">the UK this right you need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.880" end="00:08:15.610" style="s2">what&#39;s the cost of was the benefit that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:17.740" style="s2">each one of these measures is gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.610" end="00:08:21.940" style="s2">you versus was the cost for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.740" end="00:08:24.580" style="s2">maybe eliminating all sports and gives</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.940" end="00:08:26.170" style="s2">you a reduction of 10% in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.580" end="00:08:27.160" style="s2">transmission rate and that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.170" end="00:08:29.620" style="s2">want you want to reduce the transmission</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.160" end="00:08:31.630" style="s2">rate by 60 percent okay so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.620" end="00:08:33.640" style="s2">stop sports because the cost is low and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.630" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">then maybe I&#39;m stopping gatherings of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.640" end="00:08:38.020" style="s2">100 big or more because that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:39.340" style="s2">spreading and and the cost is low and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.020" end="00:08:42.099" style="s2">on and so forth and you start taking the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.340" end="00:08:44.260" style="s2">measures they&#39;re the lowest cost and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.099" end="00:08:46.790" style="s2">highest benefit and you and you and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.260" end="00:08:50.330" style="s2">add them up to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.790" end="00:08:53.090" style="s2">to run our I i I&#39;ve been looking online</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.330" end="00:08:55.190" style="s2">for anything like this and I&#39;ve not seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.090" end="00:08:56.540" style="s2">anybody mention anything like this so</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.190" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">the fear is that they&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.540" end="00:09:01.220" style="s2">decision based on incomplete data</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:04.400" style="s2">because based on the wrong mental</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.220" end="00:09:05.750" style="s2">frameworks and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so half a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.400" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">third in every country is making</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.750" end="00:09:10.310" style="s2">different decisions and there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:12.140" style="s2">lot of concern as well about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.310" end="00:09:15.110" style="s2">second-order and third-order effects of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.140" end="00:09:17.750" style="s2">these kind of measures is there not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.110" end="00:09:20.510" style="s2">concern that by implementing really</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.750" end="00:09:22.820" style="s2">really strict social distancing really</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.510" end="00:09:25.790" style="s2">really strict restrictions now that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.820" end="00:09:28.340" style="s2">will could cascade into major like major</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.790" end="00:09:30.590" style="s2">economic failure and and some some</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.340" end="00:09:34.130" style="s2">effects that are potentially even worse</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.590" end="00:09:37.130" style="s2">than the the outbreak absolutely and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.130" end="00:09:42.080" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what should be baked</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.130" end="00:09:43.610" style="s2">into that cost benefit and so but but</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.080" end="00:09:47.180" style="s2">that benefit doesn&#39;t exist so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.610" end="00:09:49.100" style="s2">making those decisions intuitively here</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.180" end="00:09:50.840" style="s2">are a couple of thoughts that I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.100" end="00:09:53.210" style="s2">and can can help us make these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.840" end="00:09:56.900" style="s2">decisions you have a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.210" end="00:09:59.890" style="s2">Wuhan or the entire Bay region where</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.900" end="00:10:02.630" style="s2">they were extremely extremely aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.890" end="00:10:04.630" style="s2">that and and they can understand from</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.630" end="00:10:07.370" style="s2">there where weather second and third or</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.630" end="00:10:09.170" style="s2">problems and there were many people were</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:12.500" style="s2">locked home and died because of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.170" end="00:10:15.830" style="s2">right but then you can see something</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.500" end="00:10:19.220" style="s2">like Italy which is not too far away but</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.830" end="00:10:21.260" style="s2">much better I think because the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.220" end="00:10:23.270" style="s2">costs are things like I can go to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.260" end="00:10:27.950" style="s2">hospital I can go to the groceries you</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.270" end="00:10:29.660" style="s2">know I can&#39;t just leave home if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.950" end="00:10:32.120" style="s2">absolute for example if I absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.660" end="00:10:35.300" style="s2">have to go to work otherwise I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.120" end="00:10:37.190" style="s2">lose my job then yeah you should go be</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.300" end="00:10:42.530" style="s2">able to go to work right so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.190" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">these binary thing you can keep it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.530" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">more of of all the rainbow of options of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:48.710" style="s2">social distancing which ones are the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:51.140" style="s2">ones that have the highest cost benefit</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.710" end="00:10:53.480" style="s2">right then you stack rank them and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.140" end="00:10:56.780" style="s2">go all like you you say approved</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.480" end="00:10:58.790" style="s2">approved yes yes yes yes yes no no no no</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.780" end="00:11:00.680" style="s2">no this is the threshold based on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.790" end="00:11:02.810" style="s2">optimal ROI</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.680" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">and are you concerned because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.810" end="00:11:08.029" style="s2">from from here we&#39;re based in London</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:09.470" style="s2">that the us give and you have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.029" end="00:11:10.580" style="s2">very individualist attitude to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.470" end="00:11:13.610" style="s2">healthcare you don&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.580" end="00:11:15.740" style="s2">National Health Service you&#39;ve got very</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.610" end="00:11:18.350" style="s2">low safety nets compared to Europe so</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.740" end="00:11:20.029" style="s2">people maybe who are sick will be more</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.350" end="00:11:22.040" style="s2">encouraged to go into work because</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.029" end="00:11:22.910" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re closer to they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.040" end="00:11:25.250" style="s2">have sick pay</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.910" end="00:11:26.930" style="s2">they don&#39;t have medical insurance are</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.250" end="00:11:29.180" style="s2">you concerned that the u.s. might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.930" end="00:11:34.459" style="s2">more fragile than than other places</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.180" end="00:11:39.140" style="s2">I think this pros and cons in each</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.459" end="00:11:41.690" style="s2">country and I&#39;m closer to you to us and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.140" end="00:11:45.380" style="s2">then to Spain in France so I can compare</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.690" end="00:11:48.410" style="s2">Europe with us that way first yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.380" end="00:11:51.170" style="s2">there&#39;s no fear all sick leave</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.410" end="00:11:54.350" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll don&#39;t have insurance so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.170" end="00:11:55.880" style="s2">contacts has the health care system as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.350" end="00:11:58.220" style="s2">result a lot of people will just not be</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.880" end="00:12:00.080" style="s2">able to stop working and will not be</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.220" end="00:12:02.089" style="s2">able to go to the healthcare system all</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.080" end="00:12:05.690" style="s2">right so so so these are some of the big</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.089" end="00:12:06.920" style="s2">issues there&#39;s many more another one is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.690" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">is the healthcare system being</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.920" end="00:12:12.860" style="s2">completely privatized cannot be easily</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:16.270" style="s2">coordinated at a national level France</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.860" end="00:12:19.640" style="s2">for example is just showing the immense</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.270" end="00:12:22.130" style="s2">benefits of that coordination within 24</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.640" end="00:12:26.300" style="s2">hours they were able to to to get the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.130" end="00:12:28.940" style="s2">country prepared for this the US has a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.300" end="00:12:31.910" style="s2">few other things that are going for them</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.940" end="00:12:34.130" style="s2">first is the density it is a very low</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.910" end="00:12:37.100" style="s2">density country compared to most other</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.130" end="00:12:39.650" style="s2">countries in Europe most countries in</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.100" end="00:12:42.260" style="s2">Europe and that&#39;s great for a lower</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.650" end="00:12:44.600" style="s2">transmission level public transport is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.260" end="00:12:46.490" style="s2">very bad which is great in this yoke</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.600" end="00:12:48.350" style="s2">resistance most people take their cars</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.490" end="00:12:52.130" style="s2">that reduces the transmission in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.350" end="00:12:54.380" style="s2">public transport remote work I think is</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.130" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">relatively developed for white collar</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.380" end="00:12:58.850" style="s2">workers so I think that can help and as</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:01.339" style="s2">a rule of thumb they&#39;re a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.850" end="00:13:02.660" style="s2">individualistic so so the social</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.339" end="00:13:05.540" style="s2">transmission is probably gonna be lower</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:07.010" style="s2">finally the healthcare system the good</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.540" end="00:13:08.420" style="s2">thing about being decentralized is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.010" end="00:13:11.900" style="s2">you have a lot of different approaches</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.420" end="00:13:13.790" style="s2">to this and and the the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.900" end="00:13:15.650" style="s2">not as good can quick</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.790" end="00:13:17.690" style="s2">learn from the ones very good we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.650" end="00:13:19.370" style="s2">seeing a lot of systemic fragilities in</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.690" end="00:13:20.870" style="s2">various different areas and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.370" end="00:13:22.850" style="s2">is the ability to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.870" end="00:13:25.310" style="s2">crisis and I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.850" end="00:13:28.150" style="s2">that&#39;s required is for people to to</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.310" end="00:13:30.440" style="s2">improve their discernment to step up and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.150" end="00:13:32.510" style="s2">potentially alternatives to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.440" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">failing systems are emerging and I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.510" end="00:13:36.500" style="s2">put you in that bracket as someone who</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.700" end="00:13:38.900" style="s2">seems to be making sense of the outbreak</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.500" end="00:13:40.850" style="s2">better than most if not all in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.900" end="00:13:45.950" style="s2">mainstream media who sense that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.850" end="00:13:48.230" style="s2">people are having to step up so first on</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.950" end="00:13:50.840" style="s2">my case I think these was just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.230" end="00:13:52.340" style="s2">there was a lot of luck here involves a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.840" end="00:13:54.290" style="s2">lot of people were putting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.340" end="00:13:56.900" style="s2">things together and mine happen to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.290" end="00:13:58.940" style="s2">resonate and but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.900" end="00:14:02.600" style="s2">pieces that are at least as good if not</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.940" end="00:14:04.310" style="s2">better but mine just happened to to to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.600" end="00:14:09.830" style="s2">catch on and this is where we are I</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.310" end="00:14:13.130" style="s2">think here we are in a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.830" end="00:14:15.050" style="s2">of new information coming to society it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.130" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">reminds me for example what happened</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.050" end="00:14:22.790" style="s2">with with black seeds or the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:26.060" style="s2">election in 2016 where it took everybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.790" end="00:14:28.940" style="s2">back nobody knew how to interpret that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:31.000" style="s2">situation right and so suddenly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.940" end="00:14:34.100" style="s2">these new information in the system and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.000" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">and and the system just doesn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.100" end="00:14:39.140" style="s2">to cope with it and so it tries to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:41.300" style="s2">digest it so the question becomes when</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.140" end="00:14:43.520" style="s2">you have these this doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.300" end="00:14:47.800" style="s2">frequently by the way but but but when</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.520" end="00:14:50.060" style="s2">it happens what is the best process to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.800" end="00:14:52.210" style="s2">to process this information as quickly</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.060" end="00:14:54.410" style="s2">as possible and I would say what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.210" end="00:14:56.440" style="s2">happening today is the right way to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.410" end="00:14:56.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.010" end="00:15:03.260" style="s2">in if you think about it two weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.110" end="00:15:04.820" style="s2">in in the West nobody was thinking this</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.260" end="00:15:07.100" style="s2">is a problem and then within two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.820" end="00:15:08.600" style="s2">everybody now realizes the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.100" end="00:15:09.830" style="s2">then and I might have contributed a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.600" end="00:15:12.920" style="s2">little bit to the conversation many</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.830" end="00:15:17.180" style="s2">others have a more a lot more than than</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.920" end="00:15:19.250" style="s2">I have but these distribution off of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.180" end="00:15:23.590" style="s2">thoughts process through Twitter through</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.250" end="00:15:27.690" style="s2">Facebook through all social media makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.590" end="00:15:30.329" style="s2">gives a huge ability for our</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.690" end="00:15:35.399" style="s2">open societies to react now this is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.329" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">one this is just one way that societies</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.399" end="00:15:39.329" style="s2">can react I think that&#39;s the Western</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:43.560" style="s2">world the other approach obviously is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.329" end="00:15:46.949" style="s2">the Chinese approach right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.560" end="00:15:48.870" style="s2">there there&#39;s two differences to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.949" end="00:15:50.670" style="s2">one of them is what happened at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.870" end="00:15:53.850" style="s2">beginning of the crisis in China and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.670" end="00:15:56.040" style="s2">then what happened afterwards they</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.850" end="00:15:57.420" style="s2">didn&#39;t catch it properly they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:16:01.769" style="s2">catch it properly not because people</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.420" end="00:16:04.579" style="s2">didn&#39;t alert the system but because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.769" end="00:16:07.350" style="s2">system does not allow for free speech</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.579" end="00:16:08.699" style="s2">they had people saying hey there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.350" end="00:16:11.000" style="s2">problem here there&#39;s a problem here and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.699" end="00:16:14.490" style="s2">these people were going to prison and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.000" end="00:16:16.019" style="s2">until then they realized that that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.490" end="00:16:20.630" style="s2">prom was big and then they reacted</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.019" end="00:16:24.560" style="s2">properly so I think what that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.630" end="00:16:27.500" style="s2">illustrates is the fact that for</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.560" end="00:16:31.470" style="s2">understanding the problems and for</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.500" end="00:16:34.040" style="s2">deciding to react to them societies with</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.470" end="00:16:38.670" style="s2">free speech are going to always be</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.040" end="00:16:43.949" style="s2">substantially stronger for decisions</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.670" end="00:16:46.430" style="s2">quick and Swift decisions on what to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.949" end="00:16:49.110" style="s2">about it then it really depends</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.430" end="00:16:52.920" style="s2">you-you-you do have a dictatorship or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.110" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">very strong government of Praetorian</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.920" end="00:16:57.120" style="s2">government in China who was able to to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:59.910" style="s2">react very quickly but Singapore and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.120" end="00:17:01.980" style="s2">Taiwan were also able to react very</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.910" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">quickly so I I don&#39;t buy the argument</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:09.390" style="s2">that original regimes can react more</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:13.079" style="s2">quickly I think there&#39;s a vast component</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.390" end="00:17:15.419" style="s2">of education and culture that that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.079" end="00:17:18.390" style="s2">very important here we can do better</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.419" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">than this week and and and Taiwan and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.390" end="00:17:23.880" style="s2">Singapore are an even Japan and Korea</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:26.970" style="s2">are good examples of that can you</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.880" end="00:17:29.520" style="s2">recommend anyone any good resources for</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.970" end="00:17:31.650" style="s2">information for people to follow do the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.520" end="00:17:33.179" style="s2">people on Twitter or communities that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.650" end="00:17:37.370" style="s2">you think you&#39;re doing good sense making</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.179" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">around this yeah so so I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.370" end="00:17:47.270" style="s2">a few world of meters is great for live</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:50.120" style="s2">update on the corner virus data then</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.270" end="00:17:51.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a github repository for raw data</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.120" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">on cases deaths and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.980" end="00:17:58.730" style="s2">it&#39;s on my medium post the full link and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:00.920" style="s2">I like going to the raw data because an</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.730" end="00:18:02.420" style="s2">editorial eyes because otherwise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.920" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">very hard to tell what&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.420" end="00:18:06.770" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:11.180" style="s2">the second type of source is scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.770" end="00:18:14.030" style="s2">papers and pages like MedX for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.180" end="00:18:15.500" style="s2">you can find a lot of them there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.030" end="00:18:16.700" style="s2">think around a hundred papers that</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.500" end="00:18:19.490" style="s2">having published just this week and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.700" end="00:18:21.380" style="s2">coronavirus and it&#39;s growing very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.490" end="00:18:23.870" style="s2">fast many of them have not been</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.380" end="00:18:26.450" style="s2">peer-reviewed but but the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.870" end="00:18:30.910" style="s2">reason why scientific papers are super</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.450" end="00:18:35.960" style="s2">useful is because they are the best</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.910" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">thought-through package around a single</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.960" end="00:18:41.630" style="s2">idea and so you can then take those and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:43.250" style="s2">incorporate them as you get more</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.630" end="00:18:44.840" style="s2">information in comparing incorporating</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.250" end="00:18:46.940" style="s2">that you are thinking and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.840" end="00:18:48.920" style="s2">few so I think that&#39;s look that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.940" end="00:18:51.470" style="s2">the core layer the core layer is the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.920" end="00:18:54.500" style="s2">raw data and we always need to go back</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.470" end="00:18:57.890" style="s2">to that and then there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.500" end="00:19:00.500" style="s2">decorators on top of it and there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.890" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">think that there&#39;s there&#39;s millions that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.500" end="00:19:10.010" style="s2">are super useful there I think for me</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:15.920" style="s2">I&#39;m looking right now a couple of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.010" end="00:19:22.580" style="s2">that were useful so doctormick name is</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.920" end="00:19:24.310" style="s2">mooji civic it&#39;s at mu g ec e VI k she&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:24.310" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">these things in your article or are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.900" end="00:19:29.720" style="s2">able to share them with me after the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:31.900" style="s2">call and we can put them into the show</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.720" end="00:19:33.860" style="s2">notes maybe I was good I&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.900" end="00:19:38.150" style="s2">let&#39;s do that and then I can put them</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.860" end="00:19:39.500" style="s2">into the show notes for people just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.150" end="00:19:42.020" style="s2">couple of questions did you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.500" end="00:19:45.320" style="s2">the recent Sam Harris podcast with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.020" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">with the person from Johns Hopkins no I</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.320" end="00:19:51.210" style="s2">having this this was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:54.210" style="s2">epidemiologists at Johns Hopkins who was</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.210" end="00:19:55.980" style="s2">in charge of the infectious diseases and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.210" end="00:19:59.370" style="s2">was tasked with kind of being aware of</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.980" end="00:20:02.010" style="s2">these outbreaks they were convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.370" end="00:20:05.700" style="s2">the death rate was going to be maximum</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.010" end="00:20:07.050" style="s2">0.6% whereas your article seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.700" end="00:20:10.380" style="s2">sort of pointing at a much higher death</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.050" end="00:20:13.050" style="s2">rate than that I wanted a wrench that</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.380" end="00:20:19.230" style="s2">goes from actually zero six to four</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.050" end="00:20:25.140" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s two things to to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.230" end="00:20:27.150" style="s2">discuss about that the key one is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.140" end="00:20:31.730" style="s2">more time we read rate is not a thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.150" end="00:20:34.020" style="s2">that is only depending on the virus</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.730" end="00:20:35.670" style="s2">there are many many factors that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.020" end="00:20:38.120" style="s2">determine the death rate the average</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.670" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">death rate and one of them is just the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.120" end="00:20:44.670" style="s2">age of the population right one that at</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:48.870" style="s2">least in China the death rate for people</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.670" end="00:20:51.150" style="s2">80 and above these 15% and people much</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.870" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">younger 14 below I think is 0-2 on</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.150" end="00:20:54.750" style="s2">average right so if you have a very old</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:56.100" style="s2">opposition like Japan your mortality</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.750" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">rate is gonna be substantially higher</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.100" end="00:21:03.180" style="s2">than in Nigeria so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:06.420" style="s2">factors another factor is your</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.180" end="00:21:08.820" style="s2">denominator right how many diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.420" end="00:21:09.930" style="s2">you have because if you because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.820" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">very likely that you&#39;re gonna catch the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.930" end="00:21:13.110" style="s2">deaths somebody that dies because of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:15.110" style="s2">this you&#39;re probably gonna me do a test</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.110" end="00:21:19.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna be positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.110" end="00:21:21.660" style="s2">but when somebody just has a cough and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.350" end="00:21:22.950" style="s2">you don&#39;t test that person they might</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.660" end="00:21:24.840" style="s2">have a concurrent virus you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.950" end="00:21:27.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know right so the countries that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.840" end="00:21:29.850" style="s2">test more are going to have a lower</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.300" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">mortality rate and fatality rate because</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.850" end="00:21:37.950" style="s2">of that right so so and then a third</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">factor is healthcare system collapse so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.950" end="00:21:41.910" style="s2">so for example I think in I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.350" end="00:21:45.240" style="s2">remember the actual the specific numbers</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.910" end="00:21:47.070" style="s2">but I think in the who Bay Area the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.240" end="00:21:49.010" style="s2">fatality rate is probably gonna be close</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.070" end="00:21:51.330" style="s2">to four or five something of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.010" end="00:21:54.930" style="s2">whereas outside of who Bay is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.330" end="00:21:57.030" style="s2">close to close to 0-9 I think right why</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.930" end="00:22:00.120" style="s2">because the system collapsed in hubei</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.030" end="00:22:01.740" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t outside so whatever all of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.120" end="00:22:04.679" style="s2">this is saying is there&#39;s a very broad</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.740" end="00:22:06.779" style="s2">range of of fatality rates</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.679" end="00:22:09.299" style="s2">and the question becomes what is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.779" end="00:22:11.639" style="s2">going to be true form for us and so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.299" end="00:22:15.059" style="s2">the first factor is is as I mention</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.639" end="00:22:17.970" style="s2">right test rates and the US for example</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.059" end="00:22:20.639" style="s2">is very very very low the UK is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.970" end="00:22:24.509" style="s2">very very very low I think the UK is ten</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.639" end="00:22:27.570" style="s2">times lower than South Korea as a per</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.509" end="00:22:31.799" style="s2">capita basis and the the u.s. is even</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.570" end="00:22:35.190" style="s2">lower as of today whereas of a couple</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.799" end="00:22:38.759" style="s2">days ago so that&#39;s one the the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.190" end="00:22:40.200" style="s2">more important one is our health care</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.759" end="00:22:44.460" style="s2">system and that completely depends on</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.200" end="00:22:47.700" style="s2">our response so if we take it now and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.460" end="00:22:50.999" style="s2">slow it down we will and we control you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.700" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">like South Korea has yes if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.999" end="00:22:55.919" style="s2">very high chance that it&#39;s zero six</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">percent if we don&#39;t and the system</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.919" end="00:23:02.190" style="s2">collapses it&#39;s much more likely that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:04.619" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be like wait so it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.190" end="00:23:06.149" style="s2">us it&#39;s not a thing it&#39;s on us and how</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.619" end="00:23:08.940" style="s2">react and that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.149" end="00:23:12.330" style="s2">important to to take measures now to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.940" end="00:23:14.340" style="s2">reduce the mortality rate and so the UK</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.330" end="00:23:17.009" style="s2">has as you said before taking a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.340" end="00:23:19.019" style="s2">different angle they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.009" end="00:23:21.869" style="s2">herd immunity and managing the outbreak</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.019" end="00:23:23.940" style="s2">and in a different way to elsewhere I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.869" end="00:23:26.749" style="s2">guessing that you&#39;re quite skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.940" end="00:23:26.749" style="s2">that as a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.879" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">so I&#39;m yes but so I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.100" end="00:23:42.929" style="s2">epidemiologists are not great at</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:45.749" style="s2">communication unfortunately so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.929" end="00:23:47.580" style="s2">want to put a straw man argument I want</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.749" end="00:23:50.249" style="s2">to do the other way I want to do a steel</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.580" end="00:23:51.659" style="s2">men argument right let&#39;s let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.249" end="00:23:53.909" style="s2">understand really what they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.659" end="00:23:55.919" style="s2">say and then why I think they&#39;re wrong I</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.909" end="00:23:58.289" style="s2">think what they&#39;re saying is look this</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:24:00.059" style="s2">is very very hard to contain and so what</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.289" end="00:24:06.600" style="s2">we need to do is is spray it over time</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.059" end="00:24:11.299" style="s2">as much as we can to to get people</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.600" end="00:24:14.600" style="s2">little by little yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.299" end="00:24:16.940" style="s2">infected and then immunized so that at</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.600" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">some point in the future a first because</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.940" end="00:24:23.749" style="s2">it was little by little the health care</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:26.419" style="s2">system doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t break and be over</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.749" end="00:24:28.669" style="s2">time these people are now immune so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.419" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">transmission rate goes down and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.669" end="00:24:36.019" style="s2">this virus dies on itself and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:39.110" style="s2">that argument is is what I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.019" end="00:24:41.090" style="s2">making and it&#39;s a reasonable one here</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.110" end="00:24:42.739" style="s2">are the flaws that I see with it first</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.090" end="00:24:44.269" style="s2">is they&#39;re not accounting for the active</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.739" end="00:24:46.429" style="s2">the fact that the vaccine is gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.269" end="00:24:48.739" style="s2">in a year to year and a half right so in</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.429" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">fact if you can slow down as much as</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.739" end="00:24:52.070" style="s2">possible this thing for up to a year to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:56.059" style="s2">a year and a half in fact a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.070" end="00:24:58.700" style="s2">people who would catch it will will</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.059" end="00:25:01.850" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t catch it at all and so they</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.700" end="00:25:03.289" style="s2">would survive right I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.850" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">first thing that&#39;s the second thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.289" end="00:25:08.809" style="s2">is crucial is that reasoning is valid</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:11.749" style="s2">but it also means that you need to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.809" end="00:25:13.309" style="s2">to take action now if you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.749" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">action now you&#39;re gonna have a massive</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.309" end="00:25:17.330" style="s2">peak and your argument of flooding the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:20.359" style="s2">curve and spreading the cases over time</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.330" end="00:25:23.179" style="s2">is not a revalued anymore and that is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.359" end="00:25:24.950" style="s2">me the specific area where they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.179" end="00:25:27.619" style="s2">their reasoning is flawed if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.950" end="00:25:29.149" style="s2">saying herd immunity slowly then they</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.619" end="00:25:31.789" style="s2">need to make an take action right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.149" end="00:25:35.029" style="s2">not tomorrow not on Monday in to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.789" end="00:25:37.489" style="s2">action right now so we use suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.029" end="00:25:39.980" style="s2">that the the social distancing will need</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.489" end="00:25:44.379" style="s2">to be in place for until the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.980" end="00:25:44.379" style="s2">arrives for a year year and a half so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.369" end="00:25:51.859" style="s2">yes but that said that like that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.789" end="00:25:55.190" style="s2">suggests that social distancing is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.859" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">binary thing is there it&#39;s it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.190" end="00:25:59.389" style="s2">there is social distancing or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:02.029" style="s2">not and that&#39;s not true what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.389" end="00:26:04.549" style="s2">do is right now do a lot of social</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.029" end="00:26:07.330" style="s2">distancing to get this thing as low as</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.549" end="00:26:11.149" style="s2">possible as fast as possible and once</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.330" end="00:26:13.970" style="s2">that dies down they&#39;re still gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.149" end="00:26:16.539" style="s2">few cases here and there but then we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.970" end="00:26:21.740" style="s2">release the social distancing measures</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.539" end="00:26:24.440" style="s2">slowly so that the virus now starts</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.740" end="00:26:27.320" style="s2">spreading again but slowly and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.440" end="00:26:29.570" style="s2">full way so that our healthcare system</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.320" end="00:26:32.600" style="s2">can learn from it can increase its</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.570" end="00:26:34.550" style="s2">capacity and and then we can play with</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.600" end="00:26:37.520" style="s2">these things the more we understand them</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.550" end="00:26:40.490" style="s2">the better right is there going to be no</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.520" end="00:26:42.070" style="s2">Premier League for a year well mmm if</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.490" end="00:26:45.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the biggest thing that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.070" end="00:26:47.660" style="s2">contributes to to the viral spread yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.020" end="00:26:49.610" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not so bad it&#39;s not for</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.660" end="00:26:51.460" style="s2">that for the clubs but it&#39;s not so bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.610" end="00:26:53.720" style="s2">for the rest of us of society right</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.460" end="00:26:55.540" style="s2">should we all stop going to groceries</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.720" end="00:26:58.070" style="s2">right now no absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.540" end="00:26:59.210" style="s2">schools what about schools right so so</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.070" end="00:27:01.070" style="s2">these are but these are the decisions</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.210" end="00:27:03.620" style="s2">that need to be made it&#39;s not social</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.070" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">distancing yes or not is a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.620" end="00:27:07.040" style="s2">things that contribute to transfer to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:09.110" style="s2">transmission why are the ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.040" end="00:27:11.450" style="s2">should be still doing today and the ones</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.110" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">that we should stop and what is that why</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.450" end="00:27:17.630" style="s2">it&#39;s true today and how does not evolve</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">over time and what do you what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.630" end="00:27:22.100" style="s2">the most likely trajectory of this from</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">what you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.100" end="00:27:25.850" style="s2">going forward I guess so it all depends</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:28.190" style="s2">on what it what actions are taken now</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.850" end="00:27:30.590" style="s2">but but what are you what are you saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.190" end="00:27:34.010" style="s2">longer-term what are your fears and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.590" end="00:27:35.990" style="s2">do you thinks the best case it depends</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.010" end="00:27:40.400" style="s2">completely on the country and and how</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.990" end="00:27:41.900" style="s2">each country reacts let&#39;s see let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.400" end="00:27:44.120" style="s2">let&#39;s do a worst case and then a best</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.900" end="00:27:47.810" style="s2">case worst case a lot of these countries</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.120" end="00:27:56.420" style="s2">don&#39;t react and then it&#39;s an epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.810" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">everywhere the the countries that want</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.420" end="00:28:02.620" style="s2">to be protected will shut down their</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.110" end="00:28:05.180" style="s2">their their borders for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.620" end="00:28:07.640" style="s2">flights are not going to be available</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.180" end="00:28:10.970" style="s2">for a very long time between these</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.640" end="00:28:14.030" style="s2">countries there&#39;s going to be heavy</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.970" end="00:28:17.660" style="s2">heavy social distancing measures in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.030" end="00:28:20.600" style="s2">countries that that are taking this</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.660" end="00:28:25.580" style="s2">seriously and that will last up till</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.600" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">when we have vaccine in one year to year</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.580" end="00:28:32.780" style="s2">half the that&#39;s the worst case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:34.970" style="s2">the the best case scenario is every</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.780" end="00:28:37.220" style="s2">country realizes very very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.970" end="00:28:38.179" style="s2">learning from each other that this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.220" end="00:28:40.519" style="s2">very serious</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.179" end="00:28:44.090" style="s2">and they all take social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.519" end="00:28:47.960" style="s2">measures right now therefore lowering</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.090" end="00:28:50.929" style="s2">massively the the transmission rates</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.960" end="00:28:52.549" style="s2">today and lowering in the next so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.929" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">would mean that we would have a peak in</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.549" end="00:28:56.149" style="s2">cases in a couple of weeks and then it</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.970" style="s2">would start slowing down so you do a</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.149" end="00:29:01.490" style="s2">heavy social distancing for four to six</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.970" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">weeks this thing goes down dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.490" end="00:29:04.490" style="s2">everywhere and then you start across the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:08.350" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.490" end="00:29:11.090" style="s2">releasing the the social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.350" end="00:29:12.830" style="s2">measures there&#39;s one more thing I want</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.090" end="00:29:20.149" style="s2">to add here is we&#39;ve talked about social</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.830" end="00:29:23.539" style="s2">distancing but social distancing is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.149" end="00:29:24.590" style="s2">one of the key levers to affect</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.539" end="00:29:27.139" style="s2">transmission but it&#39;s not the only one</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.590" end="00:29:29.950" style="s2">so if you think about it right how does</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.139" end="00:29:33.499" style="s2">transition this transition this</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.950" end="00:29:36.730" style="s2">transmission rate work it depends on how</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.499" end="00:29:40.159" style="s2">many people you meet every day and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.730" end="00:29:43.460" style="s2">percentage of those meetings become a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:45.980" style="s2">contagion social distancing plays</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.460" end="00:29:48.679" style="s2">against the first factor it reduces the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.980" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">number of people you meet it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.679" end="00:29:54.169" style="s2">play as much in the contagion between</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:58.129" style="s2">people so that&#39;s the second lever that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.169" end="00:30:00.019" style="s2">we can massively be using over over the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.129" end="00:30:02.779" style="s2">next year so for example when people say</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.019" end="00:30:05.269" style="s2">stop handshaking doesn&#39;t notice that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.779" end="00:30:09.379" style="s2">that is that can be considered in social</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.269" end="00:30:11.450" style="s2">distancing a factor but it&#39;s not as much</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.379" end="00:30:12.919" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna need fewer people it&#39;s if I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.450" end="00:30:15.590" style="s2">meet them I mean there&#39;s gonna be less</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.919" end="00:30:18.679" style="s2">contagion right so things like I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.590" end="00:30:20.509" style="s2">work at least from a distance of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.679" end="00:30:22.340" style="s2">couple of meters from you I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.509" end="00:30:26.360" style="s2">shake your hands I&#39;m gonna be wearing</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.340" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">masks I&#39;m going to learn not to touch</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.360" end="00:30:31.669" style="s2">with my face I&#39;m gonna learn to wash my</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:33.559" style="s2">hands every 20 minutes and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.669" end="00:30:35.480" style="s2">forth all these measures are not as much</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.559" end="00:30:36.889" style="s2">social distancing but they also</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.480" end="00:30:39.110" style="s2">dramatically reduce the transmission</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.889" end="00:30:43.399" style="s2">rate and these are actually not as</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.110" end="00:30:45.950" style="s2">expensive so I think though in my very</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.399" end="00:30:48.019" style="s2">well be that you can reduce by half the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.950" end="00:30:50.749" style="s2">transmission rate with this and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.019" end="00:30:52.160" style="s2">this is not a dramatic epidemic anymore</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.749" end="00:30:53.450" style="s2">all right so as</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.160" end="00:30:54.920" style="s2">society over the next few weeks we need</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.450" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">to learn what are these levers to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.920" end="00:30:57.470" style="s2">the transmission rate some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:30:59.950" style="s2">going social distancing some of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:03.680" style="s2">reducing the contagion per per encounter</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.950" end="00:31:05.150" style="s2">and and together figure out the the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.680" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">to not collapse healthcare systems and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.150" end="00:31:12.290" style="s2">and optimize both mortality rates and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:14.780" style="s2">the economy right</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.290" end="00:31:15.770" style="s2">thank you very much Thomas and yeah</p>
