<p begin="00:00:46.999" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">different in this episode he and I are</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.129" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">going to interact in a pretty freeform</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.960" end="00:00:56.600" style="s2">fashion Jordan has a concept of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:59.149" style="s2">versus simulated thinking and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.600" end="00:01:00.829" style="s2">committed tonight to try and do thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.149" end="00:01:02.359" style="s2">Jordan why do you start off by telling</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.829" end="00:01:05.560" style="s2">the audience about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.359" end="00:01:08.300" style="s2">between thinking and simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.560" end="00:01:10.520" style="s2">interesting okay so I guess to begin we</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.300" end="00:01:11.930" style="s2">can maybe make the distinction that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.520" end="00:01:13.970" style="s2">think it&#39;s pretty common in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.930" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">literature between something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.970" end="00:01:18.260" style="s2">called habit mode and maybe something</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:20.270" style="s2">you might call contemplation that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.260" end="00:01:22.730" style="s2">seeking mode the notion here is that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.270" end="00:01:25.310" style="s2">way that the human mind brain works</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.730" end="00:01:28.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a portion of your awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.310" end="00:01:30.650" style="s2">is very sort of open and exploring and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.330" end="00:01:32.780" style="s2">endeavouring to bias in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.650" end="00:01:34.160" style="s2">perception and there&#39;s a portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.780" end="00:01:36.410" style="s2">way that your brain works that when</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.160" end="00:01:38.060" style="s2">particular behaviors or functions have</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.410" end="00:01:39.950" style="s2">been pretty well understood or reduced</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.060" end="00:01:41.990" style="s2">to habits and therefore extremely</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.950" end="00:01:43.970" style="s2">efficient so kind of the classic example</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.990" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">is that as you become quite skillful at</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.970" end="00:01:47.570" style="s2">driving you can find yourself doing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:48.950" style="s2">very complicated function of driving and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.570" end="00:01:50.540" style="s2">doing many of the things of the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.950" end="00:01:51.980" style="s2">time certainly having a conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.540" end="00:01:53.900" style="s2">course with your Millennial you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.980" end="00:01:55.550" style="s2">probably texting to the first is just to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.900" end="00:01:58.490" style="s2">recognize that having both of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.550" end="00:02:00.830" style="s2">modes is part of just being a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.490" end="00:02:02.540" style="s2">personality mind and that each one has</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.830" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">different strengths and weaknesses of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.540" end="00:02:06.110" style="s2">your different to do your accounting</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">move to the time you&#39;re actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.110" end="00:02:10.159" style="s2">to do some function of habit mode to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.569" style="s2">just doing the raw math for example you</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.159" end="00:02:13.670" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be contemplating deep with</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.569" end="00:02:15.230" style="s2">a very nature number and in that context</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.670" end="00:02:17.620" style="s2">by contrast for example if you are</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.230" end="00:02:20.810" style="s2">hunting not particularly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.620" end="00:02:22.730" style="s2">hunting on the move if you&#39;re tracking a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.810" end="00:02:24.700" style="s2">large portion of your awareness will</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.730" end="00:02:26.709" style="s2">actually have to be pretty wide open</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.700" end="00:02:28.540" style="s2">sensitive to signals that may not be</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.709" end="00:02:30.099" style="s2">obvious signals this is even more so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.540" end="00:02:31.959" style="s2">case if you&#39;re not just hunting but are</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.099" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">in say a combat environment where the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.959" end="00:02:36.730" style="s2">opponent is as adept at simulating</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.900" style="s2">and/or obfuscating signal as you are</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.730" end="00:02:40.450" style="s2">trying to tease it out</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.900" end="00:02:42.280" style="s2">so the concept of simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.450" end="00:02:45.000" style="s2">then what it does is it takes this</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.280" end="00:02:47.800" style="s2">notion of saying have in mind and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.000" end="00:02:49.930" style="s2">notices that a large portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.800" end="00:02:52.180" style="s2">culture that we&#39;ve been raised in and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.930" end="00:02:54.730" style="s2">this is going on for hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.180" end="00:02:57.130" style="s2">is well frankly quite artificial and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.730" end="00:02:59.500" style="s2">quite optimized so we go to school and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.130" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">we very quickly you know somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.500" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">around third or fourth grade learn that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:05.530" style="s2">understanding what&#39;s being taught is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:08.739" style="s2">really the nature of the game but rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.530" end="00:03:11.230" style="s2">being able to repeat back the correct</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.739" end="00:03:13.000" style="s2">answers with precision and speed is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.230" end="00:03:16.540" style="s2">nature of the game and so we begin to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.000" end="00:03:19.540" style="s2">actually use more and more of a habbit</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.540" end="00:03:22.030" style="s2">mind light approach to cover more and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.540" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">more aspects of what thinking might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.030" end="00:03:25.569" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a proposition that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.209" style="s2">making when I make this distinction</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.569" end="00:03:31.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a threshold where habbit mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.209" end="00:03:33.489" style="s2">actually begins to take itself as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.390" end="00:03:35.230" style="s2">whole of thinking we have so many</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.489" end="00:03:37.959" style="s2">different schema that have been loaded</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.230" end="00:03:40.120" style="s2">into our brain on how to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.959" end="00:03:42.670" style="s2">different conversational gambits or</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.120" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">events in our environment then we are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.670" end="00:03:47.320" style="s2">fact almost exclusively acting out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:50.500" style="s2">habit and almost not at all actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.320" end="00:03:52.269" style="s2">using the part of mind to truly deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.500" end="00:03:54.250" style="s2">contemplate what&#39;s happening in front of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.269" end="00:03:55.930" style="s2">us and the proposition is that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.250" end="00:03:58.030" style="s2">trap that we would find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.930" end="00:04:00.430" style="s2">simulated thinking it can be very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.030" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">effective in circumstances that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.430" end="00:04:04.299" style="s2">what&#39;s called ordinary like say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:05.950" style="s2">in school it could be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.299" end="00:04:07.900" style="s2">ineffective when you&#39;re actually in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.950" end="00:04:09.579" style="s2">novel environment much worse than just a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.900" end="00:04:12.220" style="s2">regular old habit mind because at least</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.579" end="00:04:13.180" style="s2">have it mind is more fluidly related to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.220" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">sinking mud</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.180" end="00:04:18.039" style="s2">yeah what you call simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:20.500" style="s2">screams at me about much not all of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.039" end="00:04:22.060" style="s2">experience in big corporate America you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.500" end="00:04:24.010" style="s2">know unlike you I actually did work for</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.060" end="00:04:26.200" style="s2">big companies for quite a number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.010" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">years and the number of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.200" end="00:04:30.700" style="s2">that could only be called simulated</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:32.530" style="s2">thinking actually dominates I would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.700" end="00:04:34.169" style="s2">most of the interactions in large</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.530" end="00:04:36.029" style="s2">corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.169" end="00:04:37.529" style="s2">why they fairly often get caught with</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.029" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">their pants down you know you look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.529" end="00:04:41.189" style="s2">the example I like to give is in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">hometown of Washington DC we had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.189" end="00:04:46.409" style="s2">pretty big pretty strong regional home</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:48.810" style="s2">improvements Shane called Hechinger they</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.409" end="00:04:51.419" style="s2">had 120 stores over three or four states</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.810" end="00:04:54.779" style="s2">and you know they saw Home Depot and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.419" end="00:04:57.419" style="s2">Lowe&#39;s coming for 20 years right and one</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.779" end="00:04:59.639" style="s2">of the last places Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.419" end="00:05:01.469" style="s2">showed up was in the DC area because</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.639" end="00:05:03.449" style="s2">they figured Hechinger z-- was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.469" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">strong entrenched incumbent but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.449" end="00:05:08.159" style="s2">truth was Hechinger had not improved</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">their game in those 20 years and within</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.159" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">a year of Home Depot showing up</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:14.219" style="s2">Hechinger was bankrupt the only thing I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">can assume is that for 20 years they</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.219" end="00:05:17.550" style="s2">were doing simulated thinking because</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:19.949" style="s2">they could have responded the home depot</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.550" end="00:05:21.629" style="s2">mix was a little smarter a little better</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.949" end="00:05:23.370" style="s2">than Hechinger z-- but not by light</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.629" end="00:05:24.870" style="s2">years but I can just see it now they</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.370" end="00:05:26.189" style="s2">were involved in you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.870" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">jerking each other off in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.189" end="00:05:30.089" style="s2">conventional fashion for 20 years hoping</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:31.770" style="s2">nothing would happen or at least that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.089" end="00:05:33.270" style="s2">their pensions would vest and then when</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.770" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">the opponent actually showed up they</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.270" end="00:05:36.629" style="s2">collapsed this happens again and again</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:38.189" style="s2">and again in fact in a part of my role</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.629" end="00:05:39.870" style="s2">in corporate American probably the only</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.629" end="00:06:31.469" style="s2">because it really does say something</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.280" end="00:06:45.410" style="s2">Jordan is pretty well known for saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.650" end="00:06:46.280" style="s2">the end is near in the current game in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.410" end="00:06:48.950" style="s2">the status quo</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.740" end="00:07:07.010" style="s2">soon he calls the current game game a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.850" end="00:07:09.770" style="s2">want you to tell us about what is game a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.010" end="00:07:12.290" style="s2">and why you think it&#39;s getting near the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.770" end="00:07:14.780" style="s2">end of its time okay I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.290" end="00:07:17.870" style="s2">opening with simulated thinking actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.780" end="00:07:19.550" style="s2">provides a nice context for walking into</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.870" end="00:07:21.620" style="s2">the broader notion of game a because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.550" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">two are I think meaningfully related if</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.620" end="00:07:25.250" style="s2">you think about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:27.800" style="s2">circumstances that tend to give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.250" end="00:07:28.850" style="s2">simulated thinking and maybe just sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.800" end="00:07:31.100" style="s2">of generalize them think about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.850" end="00:07:33.860" style="s2">various kind predominantly when one</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.430" end="00:07:42.290" style="s2">uncertain or from the wall from</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.920" end="00:07:44.360" style="s2">complexity quite precisely simulated</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.290" end="00:07:45.800" style="s2">thinking can tend to settle in so when</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.360" end="00:07:48.310" style="s2">you&#39;re to use the Game of Thrones</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.800" end="00:07:50.420" style="s2">metaphor when you&#39;re in King&#39;s Landing</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.310" end="00:07:52.250" style="s2">simulated thinking actually tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.420" end="00:07:54.380" style="s2">a very good strategy when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.250" end="00:07:56.420" style="s2">north winter or more specifically nature</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.380" end="00:07:57.470" style="s2">will kill you if you&#39;re simulated</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.420" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">thinking so there&#39;s kind of a pressure</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.470" end="00:08:02.120" style="s2">there okay so the jury to formulating</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:04.730" style="s2">game a has frankly been quite long it</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.120" end="00:08:06.320" style="s2">began with just taking a look at very</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.730" end="00:08:09.950" style="s2">concrete things like the financial</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.320" end="00:08:12.380" style="s2">crisis of 2008 and why exactly even as</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.950" end="00:08:14.780" style="s2">early as 2008 it was immediately evident</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.380" end="00:08:16.670" style="s2">that political systems in the West were</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.780" end="00:08:19.370" style="s2">beginning the process of some quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.670" end="00:08:21.740" style="s2">significant breakdown and for me the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.370" end="00:08:23.810" style="s2">journey was one of just trying to look</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.740" end="00:08:25.220" style="s2">more and more deeply at what let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.810" end="00:08:26.570" style="s2">fundamental is there anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.220" end="00:08:27.710" style="s2">fundamental about this because if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.570" end="00:08:29.060" style="s2">want to figure out how to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.710" end="00:08:30.290" style="s2">problem we&#39;d like to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.060" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">actually get down to the roots of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.290" end="00:08:35.150" style="s2">problem and tear it out from the roots</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:36.740" style="s2">and most endeavors thus far at least to</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.150" end="00:08:38.990" style="s2">solve the problem have from my</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.740" end="00:08:41.450" style="s2">perspective been budgets that in patches</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.990" end="00:08:43.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve been modifications and additions</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.450" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">to some sort of more bay</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.000" end="00:08:46.810" style="s2">architecture and have it therefore going</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.460" style="s2">all the way down so I&#39;ve spent quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.810" end="00:08:50.860" style="s2">some time and differing to go down and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.460" end="00:08:52.690" style="s2">the way that I tell the story most often</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.860" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">and I think in affection at least is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.690" end="00:08:55.300" style="s2">most understandable is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:56.470" style="s2">historical so can I go in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.300" end="00:08:58.150" style="s2">does that seem to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.470" end="00:09:01.210" style="s2">absolutely well we&#39;re thinking here</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.150" end="00:09:03.580" style="s2">we&#39;re not simulated thinking so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.210" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">think is useful all right so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.580" end="00:09:07.330" style="s2">story that seems to me to work pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:08.470" style="s2">well and just as a caveat to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.330" end="00:09:10.060" style="s2">out there I will take full</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.470" end="00:09:11.890" style="s2">responsibility for what I&#39;m about to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.060" end="00:09:13.690" style="s2">and recognizing that we are definitely</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.890" end="00:09:15.580" style="s2">in thinking space meaning it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.690" end="00:09:17.950" style="s2">likely the most of what I&#39;m saying is at</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.580" end="00:09:19.270" style="s2">best rough and a sizeable fraction was</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.950" end="00:09:22.090" style="s2">just flat out wrong so this is an effort</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.270" end="00:09:23.590" style="s2">to do something novel and I&#39;ll put my</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.090" end="00:09:24.520" style="s2">neck on the line there are many other</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.590" end="00:09:25.570" style="s2">people have been thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.520" end="00:09:28.090" style="s2">sort of thing and maybe I&#39;ll reference</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.570" end="00:09:29.530" style="s2">very specific contributions that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.090" end="00:09:31.540" style="s2">made that are substantially more</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.530" end="00:09:32.920" style="s2">rigorous than I&#39;m about to say so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.540" end="00:09:35.740" style="s2">proposition is that we we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.920" end="00:09:39.490" style="s2">essentially so far in the arc of human</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.740" end="00:09:41.380" style="s2">history three basic serious moves almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.490" end="00:09:42.910" style="s2">like three points on a line the first we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.380" end="00:09:44.970" style="s2">could just sort of broadly point to as</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.910" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">the emergence of Homo sapiens sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.970" end="00:09:49.720" style="s2">whatever it is the transition humans</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:52.089" style="s2">from being more or less like chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.720" end="00:09:53.890" style="s2">to being more or less like modern humans</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.089" end="00:09:55.510" style="s2">the second youth is the one that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.890" end="00:09:57.850" style="s2">want to point sometime out right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.510" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">which is seems to be in the order of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.850" end="00:10:01.990" style="s2">about seventy five thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:03.970" style="s2">and grabs we may even just call it the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.990" end="00:10:05.260" style="s2">upper paleolithic transition and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.970" end="00:10:06.910" style="s2">something happened in that time frame</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.260" end="00:10:08.980" style="s2">that can brought a look at is being</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.910" end="00:10:11.140" style="s2">significant and the proposition that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.980" end="00:10:13.930" style="s2">would put forward is that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.140" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">point at which Homo sapiens sapiens was</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.930" end="00:10:19.300" style="s2">able to perfect a particular or alchol a</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.300" end="00:10:25.810" style="s2">unleashing a particular capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.089" end="00:10:29.710" style="s2">was sort of Layton or ambient in social</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.640" end="00:10:50.170" style="s2">that tribal coherence so this is a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.550" end="00:10:52.089" style="s2">that a group of people can come together</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.170" end="00:10:54.010" style="s2">and in this case it&#39;s almost strictly</p>

<p begin="00:12:00.340" end="00:12:04.210" style="s2">level to be very precise it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.200" end="00:12:06.310" style="s2">hunter-gatherer bands level and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.210" end="00:12:08.170" style="s2">specifically somewhere within the notion</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.310" end="00:12:09.460" style="s2">of Dunbar so for people who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.170" end="00:12:11.140" style="s2">about the Dunbar number this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.460" end="00:12:12.970" style="s2">something that Jordan and I have used in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.140" end="00:12:14.980" style="s2">our thinking for a long time what was</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.970" end="00:12:16.810" style="s2">his name Robin Dunbar yeah Robin Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.980" end="00:12:18.700" style="s2">yeah Robin Dunbar did lots of research</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.810" end="00:12:21.520" style="s2">and found that for current humans we</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.700" end="00:12:23.050" style="s2">typically have no more than 150 real</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.520" end="00:12:25.180" style="s2">friends and any wimpy little</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.050" end="00:12:27.940" style="s2">anthropological literature and he found</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.180" end="00:12:30.040" style="s2">that in modern hunter-gatherer bands or</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.940" end="00:12:31.270" style="s2">recent almost modern ones that almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.040" end="00:12:33.940" style="s2">survived to the present</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.270" end="00:12:36.370" style="s2">it was extremely uncommon to have a band</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.940" end="00:12:38.110" style="s2">one of these extended lineages not all</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.370" end="00:12:40.270" style="s2">necessarily related they always took</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.110" end="00:12:42.340" style="s2">people in and people left very unusual</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.270" end="00:12:44.830" style="s2">for them to be bigger than 150 as they</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.340" end="00:12:46.870" style="s2">approach 150 they tended to fraction</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.830" end="00:12:48.730" style="s2">eight into two units and new people go</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.870" end="00:12:50.290" style="s2">armed on till they got the 150 and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.730" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">happened again and again so it&#39;s one to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.290" end="00:12:53.860" style="s2">make that clear that we&#39;re talking not</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:56.530" style="s2">tribal here which is the next step but</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.860" end="00:12:58.180" style="s2">hunter-gatherer yeah yeah right in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.530" end="00:13:00.040" style="s2">if one is familiar with the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.180" end="00:13:01.690" style="s2">that band is exactly right I tend to use</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.040" end="00:13:02.980" style="s2">tribal because almost nobody&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.690" end="00:13:04.420" style="s2">there with the distinction but thank you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.980" end="00:13:06.570" style="s2">in fact are you actually pulling to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.420" end="00:13:08.970" style="s2">next stage so more or less would have</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.570" end="00:13:11.610" style="s2">it could fast-forward we see this the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.970" end="00:13:13.260" style="s2">opera of humanity operating at this band</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.610" end="00:13:15.510" style="s2">level in these relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.260" end="00:13:18.450" style="s2">tight-knit groups and as the population</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.510" end="00:13:20.970" style="s2">increases beyond a certain threshold the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.450" end="00:13:23.430" style="s2">groups separate and move and so this</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.970" end="00:13:26.820" style="s2">drives the spread and over a period of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.430" end="00:13:29.310" style="s2">30 or so thousand years managed to cover</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.820" end="00:13:32.400" style="s2">the entire globe and here then begins</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.310" end="00:13:34.140" style="s2">the pressure of the next stage which may</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.400" end="00:13:35.940" style="s2">in fact be at the neolithic transition</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.140" end="00:13:40.080" style="s2">but in any event something begins to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.940" end="00:13:43.290" style="s2">happen where the primary pressure in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.080" end="00:13:46.110" style="s2">niche that you&#39;re in is no longer nature</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.290" end="00:13:47.970" style="s2">it&#39;s actually other people where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.110" end="00:13:50.370" style="s2">ability to just move to a new location</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.970" end="00:13:51.810" style="s2">that is now empty and open even maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.370" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">relatively rough location like say</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.810" end="00:13:55.980" style="s2">moving from a nice grassland into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:58.260" style="s2">desert because the grassland is now full</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.980" end="00:13:59.730" style="s2">but we can build a technology to allow</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.260" end="00:14:01.860" style="s2">surviving the desert even the deserts</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.730" end="00:14:03.330" style="s2">are relatively full of people enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.860" end="00:14:05.490" style="s2">right they&#39;re not full of people that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.330" end="00:14:07.410" style="s2">moving into these locations is now no</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.490" end="00:14:10.140" style="s2">longer easy this for now the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.410" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">begins to build and this pressure I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.140" end="00:14:14.070" style="s2">imagine for a very long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:16.080" style="s2">thousands of years tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.070" end="00:14:18.030" style="s2">years different solutions to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.080" end="00:14:20.400" style="s2">pressure would pop up as we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.030" end="00:14:22.620" style="s2">anthropological story we see tribal</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.400" end="00:14:24.450" style="s2">structures pop up tribal in the more</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.450" end="00:14:29.130" style="s2">actually do show a capacity to do things</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:37.260" style="s2">have concentrations of wealth well in</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.029" end="00:16:07.470" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s continually been</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:14.820" style="s2">quite successful in being able to expand</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.029" end="00:16:16.680" style="s2">and absorb their nearest neighbors and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.820" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">we have now pretty strong evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.680" end="00:16:21.660" style="s2">what looks like quite a catastrophe in</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.839" end="00:16:28.829" style="s2">transition where something on the order</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.950" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">of like 90 percent of all male lines</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.829" end="00:16:32.339" style="s2">were extinguished and i would propose</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:34.980" style="s2">that that&#39;s the story of the story of</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.339" end="00:16:37.110" style="s2">game a wherever it was discovered the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.980" end="00:16:39.029" style="s2">neighbors got more or less slaughtered</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.110" end="00:16:40.589" style="s2">the women became part of the game a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.029" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">structure the civilization began to</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.589" end="00:16:44.190" style="s2">expand and then the neighbors either had</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.190" end="00:16:47.970" style="s2">emerging civilization or had to up their</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.649" end="00:16:49.890" style="s2">game and become a new game a player</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.970" end="00:16:52.740" style="s2">right so the relationship for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.890" end="00:16:54.630" style="s2">between Samaria and the Acadians is an</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.740" end="00:16:55.890" style="s2">example of that last piece so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.630" end="00:16:57.930" style="s2">like a good place to pause there and see</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.890" end="00:17:00.209" style="s2">where we are in the story okay it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.930" end="00:17:02.190" style="s2">a question about the technology do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.209" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">see this transition happening around the</p>

<p begin="00:17:06.120" end="00:17:10.050" style="s2">little earlier than that my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.100" end="00:17:11.910" style="s2">that it&#39;s right up at this threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.050" end="00:17:13.130" style="s2">and the development of agriculture is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.910" end="00:17:15.230" style="s2">part of the tool</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.130" end="00:17:17.660" style="s2">probably a little bit later than its</p>

<p begin="00:17:21.110" end="00:17:25.970" style="s2">beginning to have a population base that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.059" end="00:17:27.860" style="s2">is larger they can be reasonably handled</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.970" end="00:17:30.200" style="s2">by hunting and gathering particularly</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.860" end="00:17:32.570" style="s2">because the other technologies of game a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.200" end="00:17:33.620" style="s2">tend to be not as easily mobile so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.570" end="00:17:35.870" style="s2">have to be a little bit more sedentary</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.620" end="00:17:38.360" style="s2">which then leads to a recursive search</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.870" end="00:17:40.910" style="s2">on how do we begin to use what was in</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.789" end="00:17:47.419" style="s2">these now with a little bit more urgency</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.500" end="00:17:48.919" style="s2">and you kind of pop through the</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.919" end="00:17:52.309" style="s2">timeframe so just to hold that for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.750" end="00:17:53.630" style="s2">second if you run all the way back to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.309" end="00:17:55.640" style="s2">the story of the emergence of Homo</p>

<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:02.510" style="s2">needed to be able to for example figure</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:08.360" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s and you had to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.820" end="00:18:12.010" style="s2">the problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.360" end="00:18:14.750" style="s2">of radically increasing both the</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.610" end="00:18:20.210" style="s2">and you had to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.990" end="00:18:22.630" style="s2">increase or really quite significantly</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.210" end="00:18:24.860" style="s2">change the gestation and early childhood</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.630" end="00:18:26.059" style="s2">learning because of course as humans</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.860" end="00:18:28.340" style="s2">were beginning to grow larger and larger</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.059" end="00:18:30.530" style="s2">crania the physical capacity of women to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.340" end="00:18:32.630" style="s2">give birth was limited and so you had</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.630" end="00:18:36.679" style="s2">required grandmothers and required more</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.520" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">complete waste of time and so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.929" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">really challenging issue of getting a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:48.919" style="s2">multivariate complex system to actually</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.919" end="00:18:52.549" style="s2">different pieces almost randomly but</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.659" end="00:18:54.350" style="s2">just enough to create enough possibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.549" end="00:18:56.210" style="s2">to move the whole thing closer and</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.210" end="00:19:00.440" style="s2">once it hits the basin there&#39;s a pop and</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">suddenly okay we now have enough of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.440" end="00:19:04.789" style="s2">pieces and plates that a whole new theme</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:06.620" style="s2">kicks off called humanity and we move</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.240" end="00:19:21.020" style="s2">which included things like the ability</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.020" end="00:19:24.380" style="s2">able to actually use constructs of time</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.909" end="00:19:24.809" style="s2">to be able to notice when seasons are</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.519" end="00:19:29.580" style="s2">ik cetera et cetera raises a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.289" end="00:19:31.499" style="s2">of different things to have to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.580" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">together know one of which is enough to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.499" end="00:19:37.769" style="s2">cause enough density and stability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:40.499" style="s2">land but once the complex hits BAM you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.769" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">have this new sin and it begins to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.499" end="00:19:44.279" style="s2">expand in the world because now can was</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:46.740" style="s2">notably it can scale it can actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.279" end="00:19:50.190" style="s2">grow the number of human beings that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.740" end="00:19:53.789" style="s2">participating in a pro-social in-group</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.190" end="00:19:55.559" style="s2">vastly beyond the Dunbar limit I like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.789" end="00:19:57.269" style="s2">make a couple comments about that if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.559" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">think about this yes it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.269" end="00:20:01.169" style="s2">transition but unfortunately it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:02.730" style="s2">one-way transition right the densities</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.169" end="00:20:05.279" style="s2">get way higher than could support</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.730" end="00:20:07.769" style="s2">foragers so once the society makes the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.279" end="00:20:10.950" style="s2">transition to settled agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.769" end="00:20:12.840" style="s2">such it cannot peacefully go back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.950" end="00:20:14.669" style="s2">being a forager society we know some</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.840" end="00:20:16.289" style="s2">cases where they&#39;ve collapsed and been</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.669" end="00:20:17.879" style="s2">big die outs and they&#39;ve gone back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.289" end="00:20:20.789" style="s2">being foragers but essentially in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.879" end="00:20:23.159" style="s2">positive mode it&#39;s a one-way ratchet the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.789" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">other part as you probably know there</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.159" end="00:20:26.879" style="s2">are many people who believe the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:28.950" style="s2">invention of this settled agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.879" end="00:20:31.320" style="s2">game a complex was actually a great</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.950" end="00:20:33.860" style="s2">tragedy at some level because the band</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.320" end="00:20:36.899" style="s2">level had developed a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.860" end="00:20:38.279" style="s2">adaptation against hierarchy I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.899" end="00:20:40.679" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve read Chris Bohm&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.279" end="00:20:42.740" style="s2">hierarchy in the forest yeah wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.679" end="00:20:45.450" style="s2">if you want to think about humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.740" end="00:20:47.100" style="s2">organization and all this read Chris</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.450" end="00:20:49.529" style="s2">poems hierarchy and a jungle really</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.100" end="00:20:51.480" style="s2">should be titled non hierarchy in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.529" end="00:20:54.330" style="s2">jungle cuz his thesis based on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.480" end="00:20:56.789" style="s2">work is that the band level Homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.330" end="00:20:59.059" style="s2">no Dunbar number and below had developed</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.789" end="00:21:02.399" style="s2">essentially everywhere on Earth a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.059" end="00:21:04.860" style="s2">allergy to hierarchy to bosses to big</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.399" end="00:21:07.499" style="s2">shots and this is somewhat in opposition</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.860" end="00:21:10.590" style="s2">to our genetic heritage chimps are very</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.499" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">hierarchical animals and probably band</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.590" end="00:21:15.330" style="s2">level humans had the genetic tendency</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:17.700" style="s2">towards relatively rigid hierarchy but</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.330" end="00:21:20.909" style="s2">Chris suggests it was a development of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.700" end="00:21:23.129" style="s2">weaponry that allowed two betas to kill</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.909" end="00:21:25.769" style="s2">an alpha which allowed the band to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.129" end="00:21:29.129" style="s2">essentially develop an ethos against</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.769" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">hierarchy and when the game a complex</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.129" end="00:21:32.380" style="s2">came into being and the way it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:34.800" style="s2">transitioned above the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.380" end="00:21:37.350" style="s2">our numbers was to develop hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.800" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">technology-mediated with essentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.350" end="00:21:43.270" style="s2">Praetorian guards or a small military</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.350" end="00:21:45.700" style="s2">caste that was very loyal to the leaders</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.270" end="00:21:47.980" style="s2">that could finally break out of the anti</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.700" end="00:21:50.500" style="s2">hierarchical operating system that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.980" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">had at the band level yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.500" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">that is definitely my perspective and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:56.380" style="s2">think more abstractly what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:59.650" style="s2">is that the band level we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.380" end="00:22:02.860" style="s2">a where maybe a call echo formal closure</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.650" end="00:22:04.920" style="s2">over defection at least beyond a level</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.860" end="00:22:07.330" style="s2">it would be catastrophic to the group so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.920" end="00:22:09.220" style="s2">hierarchical defection is one example</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.330" end="00:22:11.230" style="s2">you also have laziness defection is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.220" end="00:22:13.270" style="s2">another example and band level groups</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.230" end="00:22:17.260" style="s2">are extraordinarily like extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.270" end="00:22:19.150" style="s2">effective at policing defection inside</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.260" end="00:22:20.680" style="s2">the group and I mean defection here in</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.150" end="00:22:23.410" style="s2">the classic sort of game theoretic sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.680" end="00:22:25.780" style="s2">Free Riders as we know every system of</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.410" end="00:22:28.510" style="s2">cooperation is subject to erosion vyak</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.780" end="00:22:30.580" style="s2">Free Riders yeah and my proposition is</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.510" end="00:22:33.220" style="s2">that in many ways we&#39;re looking at in</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.580" end="00:22:34.390" style="s2">the Dunbar complex and here I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.220" end="00:22:36.580" style="s2">use the phrase number limit at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.390" end="00:22:38.560" style="s2">Dunbar complex the set of would appears</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.580" end="00:22:41.620" style="s2">to be even the neurological capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.560" end="00:22:43.810" style="s2">to engage in really robust modeling if</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.620" end="00:22:45.400" style="s2">every other member and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.810" end="00:22:47.020" style="s2">complex of relationships between the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.400" end="00:22:49.900" style="s2">members I would propose this in fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.020" end="00:22:52.180" style="s2">evolution being sensitive to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.900" end="00:22:53.680" style="s2">catastrophic effects of defection in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.180" end="00:22:55.660" style="s2">cooperation environments and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.680" end="00:22:57.490" style="s2">essentially every human group that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.660" end="00:22:59.950" style="s2">couldn&#39;t police that level detection</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.490" end="00:23:01.630" style="s2">well enough would eventually find itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.950" end="00:23:02.740" style="s2">beginning some kind of degradation of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.630" end="00:23:04.270" style="s2">collective intelligence it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.740" end="00:23:05.830" style="s2">essentially catastrophic to collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.270" end="00:23:07.270" style="s2">intelligence and therefore be selected</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.830" end="00:23:07.900" style="s2">against and so over a long enough period</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.270" end="00:23:09.700" style="s2">of time</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.900" end="00:23:12.670" style="s2">this is Dunbar complex emerge that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.700" end="00:23:14.830" style="s2">enabled the band level to adorn against</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.670" end="00:23:16.840" style="s2">defection from individual members wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.830" end="00:23:18.850" style="s2">this come up as a primary problem with</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.840" end="00:23:21.640" style="s2">game it interesting I&#39;ve long thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.850" end="00:23:24.130" style="s2">that homo sapiens sapiens even probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.640" end="00:23:26.830" style="s2">started at less than 150 and as we had</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.130" end="00:23:28.750" style="s2">this increased neocortex that was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.830" end="00:23:30.970" style="s2">apparatus that allowed us to essentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.750" end="00:23:33.340" style="s2">do the combinatorics to get up to around</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.970" end="00:23:35.950" style="s2">150 and while we didn&#39;t have hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.340" end="00:23:37.680" style="s2">in the jungle we certainly had a band</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.950" end="00:23:39.480" style="s2">level rating and warfare</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.680" end="00:23:41.640" style="s2">often to the point of extinction right</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.480" end="00:23:44.310" style="s2">and so you know a band that could have</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.640" end="00:23:46.290" style="s2">coherence at 150 had a very substantial</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.310" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">advantage over a band that could only</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.290" end="00:23:50.790" style="s2">have coherence at 80 and so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:52.140" style="s2">group selection advantage yeah I realize</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.790" end="00:23:53.940" style="s2">group selection is very controversial</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.140" end="00:23:55.830" style="s2">but I&#39;m gonna assume that it occurs and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.940" end="00:23:58.530" style="s2">that you know hence there was a ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.830" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">for more neocortex until the limit of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.530" end="00:24:02.550" style="s2">the pelvic girdle and the human female</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:04.710" style="s2">was reached and that basically was how</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.550" end="00:24:06.540" style="s2">we converge to the Dunbar number of 150</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.710" end="00:24:08.670" style="s2">yeah I think we&#39;re more or less in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.540" end="00:24:10.890" style="s2">agreement around that story all right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.670" end="00:24:13.050" style="s2">we&#39;re up to Jericho ten thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.890" end="00:24:15.450" style="s2">ago approximately right take the story</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.050" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">forward so now what we look at is we</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.450" end="00:24:19.260" style="s2">have the story of history essentially</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:21.210" style="s2">now so the story of Game a is the story</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.260" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">of history and it appears that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.210" end="00:24:25.560" style="s2">roughly well called three plus one and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:26.970" style="s2">we can say for but you&#39;ll see why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.560" end="00:24:28.890" style="s2">calling it three plus one failure</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.970" end="00:24:31.650" style="s2">conditions that seem to just constantly</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.890" end="00:24:34.740" style="s2">show up in the constructive game a so</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.650" end="00:24:36.510" style="s2">one is the one we&#39;ve actually been</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.740" end="00:24:38.910" style="s2">spending some time on which is detection</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.510" end="00:24:41.190" style="s2">so the band level doesn&#39;t go away</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.910" end="00:24:43.020" style="s2">it just gets subsumed in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.190" end="00:24:46.140" style="s2">construct and we see this for example in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.020" end="00:24:49.260" style="s2">say how family groups might have a group</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.140" end="00:24:51.330" style="s2">selection advantage inside a society</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.260" end="00:24:52.920" style="s2">bushes and Clinton&#39;s being American</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.330" end="00:24:54.600" style="s2">examples but of course history is right</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.920" end="00:24:56.070" style="s2">for this fact I think from the warring</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.600" end="00:24:58.530" style="s2">States period in China sits like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.070" end="00:25:01.020" style="s2">hundred Chinese families represent like</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.530" end="00:25:02.700" style="s2">eighty percent of the population the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.020" end="00:25:04.680" style="s2">Mafia is another great example where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.700" end="00:25:07.560" style="s2">can actually have inside a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.680" end="00:25:08.490" style="s2">large game a society and I guess in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.560" end="00:25:09.780" style="s2">moment I&#39;ll have to kind of be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.490" end="00:25:11.880" style="s2">more detailed but what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.780" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">what it means you will still have all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.880" end="00:25:16.950" style="s2">these band level constructs going on and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:20.070" style="s2">one of the problems that you run into is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.950" end="00:25:22.260" style="s2">policing defection and it appears that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.070" end="00:25:23.280" style="s2">for very specific reasons having to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.260" end="00:25:24.690" style="s2">with the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.280" end="00:25:27.080" style="s2">complicated in the complex which are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.690" end="00:25:29.850" style="s2">going to into a moment game a is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.080" end="00:25:32.250" style="s2">fundamentally vulnerable to defection</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.850" end="00:25:34.620" style="s2">such that no game a construct will ever</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.250" end="00:25:37.470" style="s2">long endure it will always eventually</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.620" end="00:25:38.970" style="s2">collapse either as a result of defection</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.470" end="00:25:40.980" style="s2">or as a result of the mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.970" end="00:25:43.110" style="s2">are used to police defection so</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.980" end="00:25:45.149" style="s2">to zoom in on that piece we can say that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.110" end="00:25:47.519" style="s2">some primary characteristics of the game</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.149" end="00:25:51.179" style="s2">a toolkit or what I would call society</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.519" end="00:25:53.970" style="s2">and identity and the notion here what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.179" end="00:25:57.059" style="s2">mean by the concept of society is formal</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.970" end="00:25:57.690" style="s2">as opposed to organic relationship the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.059" end="00:25:59.909" style="s2">trashman</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.690" end="00:26:01.380" style="s2">is an example of society the server of</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.380" end="00:26:04.950" style="s2">where there&#39;s a formal relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.240" end="00:26:07.139" style="s2">has a bunch of social mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.950" end="00:26:08.909" style="s2">enables a human being to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.139" end="00:26:10.950" style="s2">another human being to accomplish a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.909" end="00:26:13.409" style="s2">particular objective without having any</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.210" end="00:26:18.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole essence of society is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.769" end="00:26:20.250" style="s2">that capacity able to scale</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.330" end="00:26:21.899" style="s2">yeah social roles right in a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.250" end="00:26:24.090" style="s2">gather band everybody&#39;s a generalist</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.899" end="00:26:25.230" style="s2">right they may have some special skills</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.090" end="00:26:26.940" style="s2">I&#39;m a little bit better at flint</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.940" end="00:26:30.809" style="s2">knock Flint a little bit we can all hunt</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.919" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">we can all gather fruit when that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.809" end="00:26:35.220" style="s2">season the first sign of the more</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:37.350" style="s2">advanced societies is specialization and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.220" end="00:26:39.330" style="s2">essentially the ammunition frankly of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.350" end="00:26:41.010" style="s2">the richness of the individual and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.330" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">should be very precise also the notion</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:46.559" style="s2">the great distinct from the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.480" end="00:26:47.820" style="s2">specialization that you were mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.559" end="00:26:49.470" style="s2">the specialization that you see at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.820" end="00:26:51.029" style="s2">band level is a very fluid meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.470" end="00:26:52.620" style="s2">specialization oh they&#39;re better at</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.029" end="00:26:54.179" style="s2">flint knapping so you&#39;ll focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.620" end="00:26:55.169" style="s2">and I&#39;ll focus on something else and to</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.169" end="00:26:57.750" style="s2">something happens where your flint</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.750" end="00:27:01.169" style="s2">something shifted will just move it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.519" end="00:27:02.909" style="s2">not locked into anything is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.169" end="00:27:05.070" style="s2">nothing to lock it into when suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.909" end="00:27:08.429" style="s2">you get the construct where the formal</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.429" end="00:27:12.120" style="s2">get this really interesting possibility</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.620" end="00:27:32.190" style="s2">take precedence over the quality of the</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.710" end="00:27:41.370" style="s2">that the society has that yeah think</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.539" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">about the most degenerate examples where</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.370" end="00:27:46.049" style="s2">societies become caste societies like</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:48.360" style="s2">Indian northern India and Japan where</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.049" end="00:27:50.820" style="s2">some lineages are said to be</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.650" end="00:28:03.150" style="s2">within relatively small population so</p>

<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:31.980" style="s2">fundamental characteristic of game is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.950" end="00:28:34.590" style="s2">this notion of society which is a matrix</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.980" end="00:28:36.360" style="s2">of social roles that are formal in</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.590" end="00:28:38.429" style="s2">nature and then of course the set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.360" end="00:28:40.260" style="s2">architectures and mechanisms for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.429" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">creating the social roles for</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.260" end="00:28:43.830" style="s2">apportioning individuals - social roles</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:45.210" style="s2">- the degree to which one needs to move</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.830" end="00:28:46.440" style="s2">somebody from a social role that exists</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.210" end="00:28:47.910" style="s2">as well and then bringing those rules</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.440" end="00:28:49.559" style="s2">into relationship and of course you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.910" end="00:28:51.450" style="s2">got many many many different variations</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.559" end="00:28:54.390" style="s2">of that over time so feudalism</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.450" end="00:28:56.160" style="s2">capitalism and say classical slavery are</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.390" end="00:28:57.929" style="s2">all variations on that theme they all</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.160" end="00:28:59.309" style="s2">satisfy those core functions using</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.929" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">different techniques but the core</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.309" end="00:29:03.419" style="s2">functions are the same core functions</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:04.770" style="s2">and then the universe of that or so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.419" end="00:29:06.360" style="s2">other element is this mission of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.770" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">identity that you have the group which</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.360" end="00:29:10.410" style="s2">is now manifesting as society and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:13.080" style="s2">the individual which is now manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.410" end="00:29:15.210" style="s2">as identity and as it&#39;s also intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.080" end="00:29:17.070" style="s2">to Game a where there&#39;s an over coding</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.210" end="00:29:18.900" style="s2">or an additional element that is added</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.070" end="00:29:21.210" style="s2">to a human that is more than who they</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.900" end="00:29:23.280" style="s2">are as a human in kind of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.210" end="00:29:25.740" style="s2">said the bands really just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.280" end="00:29:28.710" style="s2">fundamentally knew each individual as a</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.019" end="00:29:58.649" style="s2">of gaming is identity anything more than</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.809" end="00:30:00.330" style="s2">the label of the cells in society not</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.649" end="00:30:02.580" style="s2">really you can see them going in both</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.330" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">directions so on the one hand the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.580" end="00:30:09.029" style="s2">identity side of the pole is the degree</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.179" end="00:30:17.850" style="s2">bottom so the role of father as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:19.590" style="s2">to just merely being a father is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.850" end="00:30:21.629" style="s2">example at that level so it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.590" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">that there&#39;s an encoded structure like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.629" end="00:30:25.289" style="s2">document somewhere that really says</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:26.879" style="s2">fatherhood contains these elements it</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.289" end="00:30:28.289" style="s2">may be actually coming from the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.879" end="00:30:30.090" style="s2">up and for a long time that may actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.289" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">still mostly be role is very natural and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.090" end="00:30:34.049" style="s2">not normal society is more coming from</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:36.840" style="s2">the top down coming from the direction</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.049" end="00:30:39.179" style="s2">of we actually we in some sense can</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.840" end="00:30:41.399" style="s2">articulate and collectively point to a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.179" end="00:30:42.929" style="s2">set of very fundamental categories that</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.399" end="00:30:44.669" style="s2">dynamic of the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.929" end="00:30:47.309" style="s2">society and identity we&#39;ll begin the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.669" end="00:30:49.789" style="s2">process of robusta find the number of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.309" end="00:30:52.769" style="s2">labels that exist in society and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.789" end="00:30:54.779" style="s2">expanding the content of what can be an</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.769" end="00:30:56.070" style="s2">identity I like that can I play that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.779" end="00:30:56.549" style="s2">back to you and tell me if you think I</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.070" end="00:30:59.820" style="s2">got it</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.549" end="00:31:02.970" style="s2">yeah which is society ramifies over time</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.820" end="00:31:05.309" style="s2">every society cell every role a person</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.970" end="00:31:07.409" style="s2">can play in society is at least one to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.309" end="00:31:08.850" style="s2">one correspondent</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.409" end="00:31:11.070" style="s2">however identity is broader because</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.850" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">there can also be identities that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.070" end="00:31:16.830" style="s2">necessarily yet been refined down to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:18.779" style="s2">square pegs in society so identity is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.830" end="00:31:20.460" style="s2">broader set of roles many of which are</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.779" end="00:31:23.039" style="s2">in society and I will add as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.460" end="00:31:26.340" style="s2">hypothetical footnote perhaps over time</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.039" end="00:31:29.460" style="s2">the ratio of identities that correspond</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.340" end="00:31:30.840" style="s2">to society increases yeah that seems</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.460" end="00:31:32.940" style="s2">right but certainly we&#39;re speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.840" end="00:31:35.009" style="s2">the same thing so by this point frankly</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.940" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">in modern American society particularly</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.009" end="00:31:38.429" style="s2">for people who follow their nose through</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:40.230" style="s2">life essentially a one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.429" end="00:31:42.299" style="s2">correspondence between identity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.230" end="00:31:43.739" style="s2">society damn close something like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.299" end="00:31:46.169" style="s2">yeah because societies become</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.739" end="00:31:48.629" style="s2">extraordinarily complicated yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.169" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">continue with your story okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.629" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">given these concepts of society and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:54.570" style="s2">identity and you&#39;ve used a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.700" style="s2">terms like boxes and pegs and labels the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.570" end="00:31:59.639" style="s2">digital image to make this easy it might</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.700" end="00:32:01.140" style="s2">be an X Y Z cube with some number of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.639" end="00:32:03.300" style="s2">relatively small cell</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.140" end="00:32:05.220" style="s2">in it but it&#39;s finite and it&#39;s somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.300" end="00:32:06.840" style="s2">regular just to simplify and the point</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.220" end="00:32:08.490" style="s2">is that it&#39;s complicated in the Dave</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.840" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">Snowden sense I&#39;m just gonna make the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.490" end="00:32:12.150" style="s2">distinction approaching the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">in the complex the complicated is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.150" end="00:32:17.070" style="s2">phenomenon that is finite and bounded in</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:18.750" style="s2">world and if you&#39;ve contemplated for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.070" end="00:32:20.910" style="s2">moment it one hundred percent of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.750" end="00:32:23.130" style="s2">complicated systems are human generated</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.910" end="00:32:26.820" style="s2">sentient generated so an example might</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.130" end="00:32:30.330" style="s2">be say a Boeing 777 or a sailing vessel</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.820" end="00:32:32.970" style="s2">where there is in fact existent and</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.330" end="00:32:34.710" style="s2">actual Compendium that includes</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.970" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">all of the components of a Boeing 777</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.710" end="00:32:40.050" style="s2">its vast and in fact all of their</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:42.060" style="s2">specific relationships in appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.050" end="00:32:45.240" style="s2">operating parameters so to the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.060" end="00:32:46.710" style="s2">which the Boeing 777 is functional it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.240" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">what it is supposed to be it is an</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.710" end="00:32:51.510" style="s2">extremely complicated system but in</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:53.820" style="s2">principle you could actually map all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.510" end="00:32:55.680" style="s2">it in a large enough database and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.820" end="00:32:57.660" style="s2">would be able to actually have a phase</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.680" end="00:32:59.790" style="s2">space that would include their totality</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.660" end="00:33:01.980" style="s2">I like Dave&#39;s examples I thought brought</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.790" end="00:33:03.630" style="s2">to life the nature of complicated for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.980" end="00:33:05.610" style="s2">at least very vividly which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.630" end="00:33:07.950" style="s2">complicated is something that at least</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.610" end="00:33:10.560" style="s2">in principle could be taken apart and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.950" end="00:33:12.090" style="s2">put back together again that&#39;s very nice</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.560" end="00:33:14.400" style="s2">yeah like that a lot yeah I stole that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.090" end="00:33:15.930" style="s2">from Dave so thanks Dave yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.400" end="00:33:17.220" style="s2">really nice and then you crossed over to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.930" end="00:33:19.740" style="s2">the other side of it and you have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.220" end="00:33:21.330" style="s2">complex which as you say could not be</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.740" end="00:33:23.220" style="s2">taken apart and put back together again</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.330" end="00:33:24.900" style="s2">and one of the characteristics of it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.220" end="00:33:26.760" style="s2">that the phase space is the very least</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.900" end="00:33:28.710" style="s2">unbounded which in principle of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.760" end="00:33:30.330" style="s2">means that in the fullness of time it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.710" end="00:33:31.710" style="s2">also at least in principle infinite</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.330" end="00:33:33.240" style="s2">depending on your relationship to how</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.710" end="00:33:35.700" style="s2">time itself is bounded but in</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.240" end="00:33:37.350" style="s2">relationship to human beings the complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.700" end="00:33:41.010" style="s2">will have the characteristic of no</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.350" end="00:33:43.020" style="s2">particular finite database is for sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.010" end="00:33:44.910" style="s2">always going to be able to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.020" end="00:33:46.530" style="s2">phase space that describes the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.910" end="00:33:48.060" style="s2">of that particular system and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.530" end="00:33:50.760" style="s2">classic difference here might be see a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.060" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">hummingbird where there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.760" end="00:33:54.390" style="s2">are going on in the hummingbird that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:57.060" style="s2">fundamentally in relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.390" end="00:33:59.160" style="s2">micro scale and the macro scale with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.060" end="00:34:01.380" style="s2">whole vat ecosystem there&#39;s an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.160" end="00:34:03.480" style="s2">connection between these two and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.380" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">relationship like the causal movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.480" end="00:34:06.250" style="s2">from the micro</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:08.950" style="s2">the matter of the cosmos or the macro</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.250" end="00:34:11.380" style="s2">down has a lot of stuff going on in the</p>

<p begin="00:38:41.280" end="00:38:45.780" style="s2">the factor and is dealt with accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:48.390" style="s2">yep and if you use that game of thrones</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.780" end="00:38:50.520" style="s2">story if you remember in the north the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.390" end="00:38:52.619" style="s2">king of the north that was a lesson like</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.520" end="00:38:55.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a very first scene or so he</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.619" end="00:38:57.570" style="s2">enforced his own moral system and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.560" end="00:38:59.430" style="s2">young wolf did the same thing right he</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.570" end="00:39:01.140" style="s2">was true to the virtue you violated the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.430" end="00:39:03.060" style="s2">rules I chop off your head</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.140" end="00:39:04.170" style="s2">and who chops off the head the King does</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.060" end="00:39:05.820" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s the big difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.170" end="00:39:07.800" style="s2">between the North and Kings Landing</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.820" end="00:39:10.320" style="s2">right there is no headsman the king</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.800" end="00:39:11.849" style="s2">himself takes the heads and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.320" end="00:39:14.070" style="s2">I think is a great allegory of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.849" end="00:39:15.770" style="s2">general story of how this art goes the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.070" end="00:39:18.900" style="s2">farther away you are the more you are in</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.770" end="00:39:21.540" style="s2">society and the less you are in nature</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.900" end="00:39:24.300" style="s2">the more you will see the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.540" end="00:39:26.430" style="s2">this feedback loop between defection</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.300" end="00:39:28.589" style="s2">behavior and the capacity of society to</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.430" end="00:39:30.450" style="s2">police defection behavior so King&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.589" end="00:39:32.580" style="s2">Landing is far from the north it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.450" end="00:39:34.680" style="s2">purely in society and so you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.580" end="00:39:37.109" style="s2">see the niche actions is just the niche</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.680" end="00:39:38.940" style="s2">of defection begin to emerge and of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.109" end="00:39:40.410" style="s2">course what&#39;s the story that poker game</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.940" end="00:39:42.630" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know that a sucker is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.410" end="00:39:43.950" style="s2">you yes one of my favorite sayings if</p>

<p begin="00:39:43.950" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know the sucker is it&#39;s used same</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.570" end="00:39:50.910" style="s2">is true apparently in a commodities</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:53.250" style="s2">trading ecosystem so if you&#39;re trading</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.910" end="00:39:56.010" style="s2">next year&#39;s corn you don&#39;t know who the</p>

<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:48.210" style="s2">actually really rather astounding how</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.300" end="00:42:38.320" style="s2">then the degradation the decadence</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.610" end="00:42:40.180" style="s2">begins and then it collapse and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.320" end="00:42:43.030" style="s2">some period of dark ages and then a</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.180" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">reboot of the new social structure while</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:48.280" style="s2">still a ways from the present why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.360" end="00:42:49.780" style="s2">we move forward from the transition from</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.280" end="00:42:53.140" style="s2">Rome from the late Republic to the</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.990" end="00:43:00.250" style="s2">second major problem that always faces</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.120" end="00:43:02.170" style="s2">gamei and then we&#39;ll have most of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.250" end="00:43:03.310" style="s2">we need and then the third we can do</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.170" end="00:43:05.020" style="s2">pretty quickly and it&#39;ll get us to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.310" end="00:43:07.240" style="s2">present is that good that sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.020" end="00:43:09.490" style="s2">let&#39;s do it the second is our good</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.240" end="00:43:11.050" style="s2">friend Joseph Tainter and the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.490" end="00:43:14.110" style="s2">he pointed out in his book the collapse</p>

<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:19.510" style="s2">more that&#39;s happened which is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:22.420" style="s2">there&#39;s an expansion of technologies</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.510" end="00:43:24.310" style="s2">capacities social tool kits that allow a</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.470" end="00:43:33.610" style="s2">that again there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.180" end="00:43:36.370" style="s2">between society and identity the process</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.610" end="00:43:38.380" style="s2">of articulating these technologies has a</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.859" end="00:45:24.190" style="s2">feedback loop very similar by the way to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.510" end="00:45:25.630" style="s2">the basic innovators dilemma inside a</p>

<p begin="00:45:25.630" end="00:45:29.049" style="s2">concerned isomorphic and so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.339" end="00:45:31.089" style="s2">is the society becomes addicted to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.049" end="00:45:33.609" style="s2">certain tools that initially they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.089" end="00:45:35.380" style="s2">really fucking useful and for a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.609" end="00:45:36.789" style="s2">while they actually go up that s-curve</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.380" end="00:45:38.200" style="s2">where they&#39;re kicking ass and society is</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.789" end="00:45:40.270" style="s2">actually getting this huge boom of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.200" end="00:45:42.190" style="s2">surplus capacity and energy that allows</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.270" end="00:45:42.819" style="s2">the society to grow a lot of different</p>

<p begin="00:45:42.819" end="00:45:46.569" style="s2">most notably in population but then the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.740" end="00:45:49.270" style="s2">society finds itself addicted to its</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.569" end="00:45:50.980" style="s2">tools it&#39;s too over its skis it&#39;s got so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.270" end="00:45:52.809" style="s2">many different constructs you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.980" end="00:45:54.940" style="s2">think about like oil in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.809" end="00:45:56.559" style="s2">now and you have pipelines all over the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.940" end="00:45:57.789" style="s2">place and you&#39;ve got giant tankers that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.559" end="00:45:59.529" style="s2">move back and forth you have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.789" end="00:46:01.450" style="s2">military-industrial complex that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.529" end="00:46:03.309" style="s2">maintains this integrity of the Saudi</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.450" end="00:46:04.630" style="s2">regime and you&#39;ve got the petro dollar I</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.309" end="00:46:05.980" style="s2">mean just think about the amount of shit</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.630" end="00:46:08.740" style="s2">that&#39;s in place to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.980" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">integrity of the oil function in global</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.740" end="00:46:13.299" style="s2">society and just run the clock back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:15.400" style="s2">the modest days more or less about a</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.299" end="00:46:16.869" style="s2">century and a half ago of shovels and</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.400" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">buckets of dirt and you can apply that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.869" end="00:46:20.500" style="s2">to any society you can take the Mayans</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">you could take the Chinese you can take</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.500" end="00:46:24.430" style="s2">the Romans it doesn&#39;t matter sort of has</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:26.799" style="s2">the same dynamic and then overlay all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.430" end="00:46:29.619" style="s2">this all these dynamics on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.799" end="00:46:31.779" style="s2">fact that the underlying resource that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.619" end="00:46:34.569" style="s2">your technology is optimized to extract</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.779" end="00:46:37.809" style="s2">is generally going to be either finite</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.569" end="00:46:39.700" style="s2">in quantity or finite in rate let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.809" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">solar power as an example in the future</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.700" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">there is a finite flux of solar energy</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">that hits the earth it&#39;s big but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.839" end="00:46:46.270" style="s2">finite right the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">or finite the amount of oil in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.270" end="00:46:50.680" style="s2">ground is finite and so there is some</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:51.460" style="s2">point at which you have a pick the lower</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.680" end="00:46:53.110" style="s2">hanging fruit</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.460" end="00:46:54.940" style="s2">so as you pick the low-hanging fruit you</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.110" end="00:46:56.350" style="s2">have to actually upgrade your technical</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.940" end="00:46:59.290" style="s2">infrastructure to be able to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.350" end="00:47:01.240" style="s2">maintain just the same amount of supply</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.290" end="00:47:02.860" style="s2">and as your society has actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.240" end="00:47:04.810" style="s2">expanded that its ability to take</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.860" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">advantage of this boon is gener going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.810" end="00:47:07.690" style="s2">actually need an increase in supply so</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:09.730" style="s2">you have to upgrade your technical</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.690" end="00:47:10.840" style="s2">infrastructure again and will end up</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.730" end="00:47:12.700" style="s2">happening and everybody has changer</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.840" end="00:47:14.680" style="s2">points out is that you get an s-curve</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.700" end="00:47:16.930" style="s2">happen at the level of innovation at a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.680" end="00:47:19.330" style="s2">certain point it takes more energy per</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.930" end="00:47:21.550" style="s2">unit innovation and then that gives you</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.330" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">an s-curve in just the actual throughput</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.550" end="00:47:25.390" style="s2">of your technical infrastructure and as</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:27.070" style="s2">you have them burned through the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.390" end="00:47:29.200" style="s2">low-hanging fruit you end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.070" end="00:47:31.510" style="s2">this increasingly fragile relationship</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.200" end="00:47:33.220" style="s2">between the way that your society goes</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.510" end="00:47:34.510" style="s2">about meeting its needs and its</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.220" end="00:47:36.220" style="s2">relationship with the resources that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.510" end="00:47:38.620" style="s2">happen to be in the ground and this then</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.220" end="00:47:40.990" style="s2">leads to generally speaking a collapse</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.620" end="00:47:42.610" style="s2">and then a reboot of an endeavor to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.990" end="00:47:44.860" style="s2">wiser next time with a more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.610" end="00:47:47.470" style="s2">social infrastructure so we could say</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.860" end="00:47:50.710" style="s2">for example the collapse of room you see</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.470" end="00:47:53.230" style="s2">both the corruption in the interior now</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.710" end="00:47:55.450" style="s2">I&#39;m in the Imperial Rome called 300 400</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.230" end="00:47:57.580" style="s2">AD with the constant turmoil of who</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.450" end="00:47:59.770" style="s2">wants to be Caesar in the generals</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.580" end="00:48:01.930" style="s2">period you have the fragility of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.770" end="00:48:04.540" style="s2">underlying infrastructure with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.930" end="00:48:06.520" style="s2">capacity to maintain the roads and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.540" end="00:48:08.140" style="s2">aqueducts and you fill in the blank the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.520" end="00:48:11.470" style="s2">whole system becoming harder and harder</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.140" end="00:48:13.450" style="s2">and harder as more and more the easy</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.470" end="00:48:14.950" style="s2">stuff in the environment goes away and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.450" end="00:48:16.060" style="s2">as the carrying cost of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.950" end="00:48:17.860" style="s2">infrastructure gets heavier and heavier</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.060" end="00:48:19.600" style="s2">and of course these two forces feedback</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.860" end="00:48:21.370" style="s2">on each other when you&#39;ve got really</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.600" end="00:48:24.250" style="s2">kick-ass totally well-functioning</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.370" end="00:48:25.870" style="s2">bureaucracy it can manage a complicated</p>

<p begin="00:48:27.220" end="00:48:29.800" style="s2">and heavier and as if your accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.570" end="00:48:31.660" style="s2">becomes more and more corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.800" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">incompetent you get a real problem go to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.660" end="00:48:34.600" style="s2">visit Heathrow and you&#39;ll get a good</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:36.250" style="s2">sense of that you know I&#39;ve done some a</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.600" end="00:48:38.050" style="s2">lot of reading on you know the late</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.250" end="00:48:40.290" style="s2">Empire and the collapse and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.050" end="00:48:42.550" style="s2">fits right into your story which is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.290" end="00:48:44.710" style="s2">governance hierarchy became more and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.550" end="00:48:46.360" style="s2">more corrupt and less and less efficient</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.710" end="00:48:48.340" style="s2">and taxes got larger and</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.360" end="00:48:50.560" style="s2">and larger until a lot of the commerce</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.340" end="00:48:52.270" style="s2">particularly in the economically wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.560" end="00:48:54.370" style="s2">eastern half of the Empire just</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:10.150" style="s2">function yeah exactly and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.740" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">how there&#39;s this really cool feedback</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.150" end="00:49:14.860" style="s2">loop where it really was in fact that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:16.780" style="s2">complicated a bureaucracy that it kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.860" end="00:49:18.340" style="s2">of just developed over time and the</p>

<p begin="00:49:18.340" end="00:49:22.450" style="s2">it well fit and well tailored and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.840" end="00:49:23.620" style="s2">functioning is intrinsically hard and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.450" end="00:49:25.840" style="s2">then just add in a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.620" end="00:49:27.700" style="s2">corruption you get a really nice dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.840" end="00:49:29.080" style="s2">of what kind of hollows gamej out from</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.700" end="00:49:31.270" style="s2">the inside and then you&#39;ve got the third</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.080" end="00:49:32.380" style="s2">which is the world is not empty there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.270" end="00:49:34.210" style="s2">other people out there who were doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.380" end="00:49:36.130" style="s2">stuff and so the Germans are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.210" end="00:49:37.630" style="s2">like sitting on the border you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.130" end="00:49:40.330" style="s2">eventually able to have enough capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.630" end="00:49:42.640" style="s2">on their own to hold back the expansion</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.330" end="00:49:45.430" style="s2">the roman empire and then for six</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.640" end="00:49:47.230" style="s2">generations kind of watching stealing</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.430" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">the best by the way cuz stealing tech is</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.230" end="00:49:50.350" style="s2">much easier than innovating it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">maintaining it stealing the best tech</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.350" end="00:49:54.760" style="s2">from the roman empire being much further</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:56.350" style="s2">or earlier in the curve of corruption so</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.760" end="00:49:58.270" style="s2">still to pay a high as to be a level</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.350" end="00:50:00.070" style="s2">very high level of policing detection</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.270" end="00:50:01.840" style="s2">while Rome is becoming hollowed out</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.070" end="00:50:03.790" style="s2">within and so the bubble pops from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.840" end="00:50:06.070" style="s2">outside in this case and the barbarians</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.790" end="00:50:07.810" style="s2">come rushing in and so of course we see</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.070" end="00:50:09.610" style="s2">that as a third movement in history is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.810" end="00:50:11.830" style="s2">that to the degree to which your</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.050" end="00:51:52.590" style="s2">of the day so far at least we have so</p>

<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">one major point is 1776</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.080" end="00:52:38.550" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the transition out of</p>

<p begin="00:58:01.480" end="00:58:05.320" style="s2">very far you couldn&#39;t do it all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.790" end="00:58:08.200" style="s2">that&#39;s right I think it&#39;s crucial I</p>

<p begin="00:58:13.480" end="00:58:19.030" style="s2">point out that the structures that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.640" end="00:58:21.880" style="s2">built are extraordinarily tall and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.030" end="00:58:24.100" style="s2">therefore even a small amount of fall</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.880" end="00:58:26.530" style="s2">has this capacity to fall a very long</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.100" end="00:58:28.540" style="s2">way and that could have make it very</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.530" end="00:58:29.770" style="s2">concrete you could just think about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.540" end="00:58:31.270" style="s2">fact that there&#39;s a lot of people if</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.770" end="00:58:33.010" style="s2">there&#39;s eight billion people sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.270" end="00:58:36.820" style="s2">top of these very tall structures and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.010" end="00:58:38.230" style="s2">the amount of pre industrial farming it</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.820" end="00:58:39.610" style="s2">was just gonna fall that far which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.230" end="00:58:40.690" style="s2">that far like it&#39;s only a century we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.690" end="00:58:44.470" style="s2">absurd if we were to fall just about a</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:47.410" style="s2">century and a half to pre-industrial</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.470" end="00:58:48.430" style="s2">farming the amount of agricultural yield</p>

<p begin="00:58:48.430" end="00:58:51.490" style="s2">only be about a billion people because</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.810" end="00:58:53.170" style="s2">by the way we&#39;ve paved over a very large</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.490" end="00:58:54.580" style="s2">fraction of the arable land and sucked</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.170" end="00:58:56.260" style="s2">out a lot of the water that we would</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.580" end="00:58:57.490" style="s2">otherwise be using and who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.260" end="00:58:59.950" style="s2">the quality of the soil is without</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.490" end="00:59:01.510" style="s2">fertilizers so that&#39;s seven billion</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.950" end="00:59:03.850" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have food in that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.510" end="00:59:05.410" style="s2">context and we should be quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.850" end="00:59:07.150" style="s2">that the seven billion people probably</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.410" end="00:59:09.480" style="s2">aren&#39;t all going to sort of voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.150" end="00:59:11.740" style="s2">walk into the Hereafter they may in fact</p>

<p begin="00:59:15.100" end="00:59:18.430" style="s2">technologies and as we saw in World War</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.930" end="00:59:20.940" style="s2">two just think about this in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.360" end="00:59:34.030" style="s2">capacity I think more or less any one of</p>

<p begin="00:59:46.600" end="00:59:49.900" style="s2">forward pretty quickly and to the degree</p>

<p begin="01:07:40.480" end="01:07:45.040" style="s2">quantitatively yeah and we can now run</p>

<p begin="01:07:54.230" end="01:07:58.520" style="s2">social granularity there will probably</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.210" end="01:08:00.200" style="s2">be many orders of magnitude it even like</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.520" end="01:08:02.750" style="s2">five or six orders of magnitude larger</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.200" end="01:08:06.050" style="s2">than what we&#39;ve seen in early 21st</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.750" end="01:08:08.329" style="s2">century America but if my model of game</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.050" end="01:08:10.820" style="s2">a is correct then it&#39;s going to collapse</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.329" end="01:08:13.670" style="s2">and by the way if we&#39;re looking at what</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.820" end="01:08:15.349" style="s2">happens in an exponential change our it</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.670" end="01:08:17.330" style="s2">will actually collapse in a relatively</p>

<p begin="01:08:17.330" end="01:08:21.920" style="s2">about seven years that ain&#39;t very long</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.859" end="01:08:23.870" style="s2">for the Z dynasty in the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.920" end="01:08:25.310" style="s2">previous Chinese dynasty so the story</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.870" end="01:08:26.779" style="s2">that I&#39;m noticing is that we have kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.310" end="01:08:28.730" style="s2">of uh I&#39;ve always been thinking there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.779" end="01:08:30.890" style="s2">almost like a bridge and then what&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.730" end="01:08:32.600" style="s2">the other side let&#39;s pause here for a</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.890" end="01:08:35.120" style="s2">second and for the audience say hey</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.600" end="01:08:37.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve gotten up to date on game a then</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.120" end="01:08:38.480" style="s2">you have also synthesized I would</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.100" end="01:08:41.180" style="s2">actually help a little bit in the early</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.480" end="01:08:43.520" style="s2">days synthesize something called game B</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.180" end="01:08:45.560" style="s2">which is an alternative for what might</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.520" end="01:08:46.910" style="s2">come next you want to talk about that a</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.560" end="01:08:48.440" style="s2">little bit some of your admittedly</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.910" end="01:08:50.660" style="s2">rougher thoughts but they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.440" end="01:08:54.350" style="s2">richer by the day thoughts on where do</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.660" end="01:08:57.710" style="s2">we go next yeah so game B is notoriously</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.350" end="01:09:00.140" style="s2">difficult to think and talk about for</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.710" end="01:09:02.779" style="s2">the very good reason that if you were</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.140" end="01:09:05.180" style="s2">using the conceptual structures that</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.779" end="01:09:07.910" style="s2">came out of game a to do so you may very</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.180" end="01:09:09.770" style="s2">well be poisoning the well and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.910" end="01:09:10.940" style="s2">fortunately in the context of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.770" end="01:09:12.140" style="s2">John&#39;s been doing I&#39;ve actually got a</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.940" end="01:09:13.850" style="s2">new way of thinking about but you</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.140" end="01:09:16.700" style="s2">actually have to find a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.850" end="01:09:19.940" style="s2">technology place to be able to do the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.700" end="01:09:21.680" style="s2">meta design for psycho technologies to</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.940" end="01:09:23.210" style="s2">actually then come back down to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.680" end="01:09:24.890" style="s2">level of doing the psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.210" end="01:09:26.450" style="s2">of game B which would be in principle</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.890" end="01:09:28.219" style="s2">now at this point distinct from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.450" end="01:09:30.109" style="s2">secretaries of game a that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.219" end="01:09:31.460" style="s2">huge insight I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m such a</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.109" end="01:09:33.170" style="s2">big deal for me I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.460" end="01:09:35.989" style="s2">articulated even vaguely useful epitome</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.170" end="01:09:38.270" style="s2">your backup game B alright so the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.989" end="01:09:42.020" style="s2">hypothesis is that the innovation of</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.270" end="01:09:43.640" style="s2">game a has now the set of three plus one</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.020" end="01:09:45.350" style="s2">and by the way the plus one is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.640" end="01:09:46.759" style="s2">problem of exponential technology you</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.350" end="01:09:48.589" style="s2">just sort of brought it in but it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.759" end="01:09:50.630" style="s2">of a problem all the time and it has an</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.589" end="01:09:52.700" style="s2">end point of its own and it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.630" end="01:09:54.200" style="s2">we&#39;re reaching the end so on the one</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.700" end="01:09:56.120" style="s2">hand you can take a look at game a and</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.200" end="01:09:58.600" style="s2">say okay any given instantiation has a</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.120" end="01:10:01.210" style="s2">finite lifespan to it and all</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.600" end="01:10:02.620" style="s2">that it appears that all kind of set of</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.210" end="01:10:04.630" style="s2">gaming instantiations have a finite</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.620" end="01:10:05.710" style="s2">lifespan to them and also it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.630" end="01:10:08.200" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of getting to the end of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.710" end="01:10:10.780" style="s2">and so it may in fact be requisite that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.200" end="01:10:13.510" style="s2">we make the extraordinarily challenging</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.780" end="01:10:16.060" style="s2">move of trying to level up a whole new</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.510" end="01:10:18.250" style="s2">collective intelligence toolkit at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.060" end="01:10:21.250" style="s2">same level of magnitude as the movement</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.250" end="01:10:23.890" style="s2">to the band / tribal level of collective</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.250" end="01:10:25.060" style="s2">intelligence and in the game a level of</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.890" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">collective intelligence from so that</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.060" end="01:10:29.080" style="s2">something that comes around every 30,000</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:31.030" style="s2">years or so so that&#39;s sort of a good way</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.080" end="01:10:32.740" style="s2">of setting the stage for the level of</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.030" end="01:10:34.150" style="s2">challenge of endeavoring to construct</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.740" end="01:10:35.110" style="s2">something of that sort but if it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.150" end="01:10:36.340" style="s2">we have to do it&#39;s what we have to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.110" end="01:10:38.590" style="s2">unfortunately we&#39;ve come a long way</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.340" end="01:10:41.080" style="s2">we&#39;re actually quite sophisticated as a</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.590" end="01:10:42.520" style="s2">species in thinking about these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.080" end="01:10:44.530" style="s2">things in comparison say tunes for</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.520" end="01:10:47.110" style="s2">example the big reboot that happened in</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.530" end="01:10:48.670" style="s2">1776 the Enlightenment gave birth to</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.110" end="01:10:50.920" style="s2">what I would say is now sort of the last</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.670" end="01:10:52.090" style="s2">stage of game a or close to it and there</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.920" end="01:10:54.430" style="s2">was a pretty big deal that was actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.090" end="01:10:55.810" style="s2">a pretty major shift they made from late</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.430" end="01:10:58.450" style="s2">stage feudalism to early stage</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.810" end="01:10:59.920" style="s2">liberalism and in the move from game any</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.450" end="01:11:02.680" style="s2">game we&#39;re looking at something this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.920" end="01:11:04.600" style="s2">similar in kind just maybe three orders</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.680" end="01:11:07.060" style="s2">of magnitude larger and magnetic or in</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.600" end="01:11:09.010" style="s2">difficulty so in that language then one</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.060" end="01:11:11.080" style="s2">of the characteristics of game B has to</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.010" end="01:11:13.540" style="s2">be that it can&#39;t be constrained by the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.080" end="01:11:16.420" style="s2">problem of complication it doesn&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.540" end="01:11:18.220" style="s2">the problems of human needs through the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.420" end="01:11:21.100" style="s2">construction of complicated systems it</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.220" end="01:11:23.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t use either society or identity</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.100" end="01:11:25.420" style="s2">to do the things that it does now this</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.500" end="01:11:26.800" style="s2">of course the very first blush has all</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.420" end="01:11:28.270" style="s2">kinds of consequences and if the beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.800" end="01:11:30.370" style="s2">to wish it demoralizes a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.270" end="01:11:32.170" style="s2">because it feels like that can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.370" end="01:11:34.780" style="s2">but we can take a look back and say okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.170" end="01:11:37.810" style="s2">we did do this at least up to the scale</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.780" end="01:11:40.030" style="s2">of the Dunbar limit back at the previous</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.810" end="01:11:42.160" style="s2">iteration we were actually running the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.030" end="01:11:44.890" style="s2">human the band level of collective</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.160" end="01:11:46.450" style="s2">intelligence was running in complexity</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.890" end="01:11:47.890" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t running in complicatedness I</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.450" end="01:11:49.570" style="s2">mean to the degree which complicated</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.890" end="01:11:50.680" style="s2">things came up they were relatively</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.570" end="01:11:52.300" style="s2">minor in the scheme of things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.680" end="01:11:55.180" style="s2">still held in a way that didn&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.300" end="01:11:58.630" style="s2">into the pitfalls of danger or defection</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.180" end="01:12:01.690" style="s2">and so a way of stating it is how do we</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.630" end="01:12:04.210" style="s2">go about maintaining the level of</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.690" end="01:12:05.500" style="s2">coherence the level of complexity as an</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.210" end="01:12:07.170" style="s2">intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.500" end="01:12:10.810" style="s2">that we have at the band level and</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.170" end="01:12:12.310" style="s2">scaling that up to include well</p>

<p begin="01:12:15.670" end="01:12:19.390" style="s2">I came to what twenty thirteen or so</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.770" end="01:12:21.310" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s still the same problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.390" end="01:12:23.350" style="s2">right that&#39;s the nature of the beast but</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.310" end="01:12:24.940" style="s2">we can actually now get the story hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.350" end="01:12:27.130" style="s2">sat still meaningfully more</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.940" end="01:12:29.320" style="s2">sophisticated in beginning to gesture in</p>

<p begin="01:12:32.260" end="01:12:34.930" style="s2">had some challenges with this but it has</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.550" end="01:12:37.240" style="s2">to do with looking at the possibility</p>

<p begin="01:13:10.690" end="01:13:14.020" style="s2">building better institutions I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.670" end="01:13:15.880" style="s2">been very involved with it for the last</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.020" end="01:13:18.250" style="s2">five years but just occasionally check</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.880" end="01:13:20.740" style="s2">in with Jordan and his friends duh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.250" end="01:13:24.460" style="s2">the usual social science answer both</p>

<p begin="01:13:24.460" end="01:13:30.370" style="s2">and so this false distinction then the</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.730" end="01:13:32.770" style="s2">civil war that the earliest version of</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.370" end="01:13:36.070" style="s2">game B fell into on personal change</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.770" end="01:13:38.410" style="s2">versus institutions I am now perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.070" end="01:13:39.490" style="s2">happy with both wow that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.410" end="01:13:41.200" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s really good because</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.490" end="01:13:42.640" style="s2">I have come to the conclusion that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.200" end="01:13:44.620" style="s2">absolutely both and quite frankly</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.640" end="01:13:46.840" style="s2">concretely because in some sense the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.620" end="01:13:48.910" style="s2">good news is that the level of making</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.840" end="01:13:50.920" style="s2">better people it&#39;s really not a whole</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.910" end="01:13:52.930" style="s2">lot about making better people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.920" end="01:13:55.570" style="s2">making less shitty people the tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.930" end="01:13:58.780" style="s2">out to the primary tragedy game a is how</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.570" end="01:14:00.340" style="s2">enormous Lee it has screwed up humans in</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.780" end="01:14:01.720" style="s2">many many different ways obviously you</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.340" end="01:14:04.000" style="s2">go back and do the beginning you look at</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.720" end="01:14:05.710" style="s2">this human lifespan got cut in about a</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.000" end="01:14:06.650" style="s2">third though you can take a look now and</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.710" end="01:14:08.480" style="s2">just take a look at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.650" end="01:14:11.330" style="s2">what I would consider to be nearly</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.480" end="01:14:13.640" style="s2">Holocaust level nastiness of what is</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.330" end="01:14:15.560" style="s2">happening to the psychology of every</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.640" end="01:14:17.420" style="s2">single child who was put through school</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.560" end="01:14:20.300" style="s2">with a degree to which we&#39;re destroying</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.420" end="01:14:22.640" style="s2">the capacities of human beings an</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.300" end="01:14:24.590" style="s2">industrial scale at the level of their</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.640" end="01:14:26.210" style="s2">psychology is really rather significant</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.590" end="01:14:28.520" style="s2">so what I&#39;ve discovered over the past</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.210" end="01:14:30.710" style="s2">five years is that while remediating</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.520" end="01:14:34.780" style="s2">that damage and bringing people friendly</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.710" end="01:14:38.360" style="s2">back to the basic capacity to be mature</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.780" end="01:14:40.790" style="s2">adults who can use the whole of their</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.360" end="01:14:42.830" style="s2">mind to be thinking and I simulated</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.790" end="01:14:45.860" style="s2">thinking is really quite hard there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.830" end="01:14:48.679" style="s2">this so the healing piece is a massive</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.860" end="01:14:51.830" style="s2">issue I myself have been struggling with</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.679" end="01:14:53.390" style="s2">that since well grants 2012 it still</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.830" end="01:14:55.070" style="s2">have a ways to go so that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.390" end="01:14:57.050" style="s2">problem like the humanity that we are</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.070" end="01:14:59.030" style="s2">working with right now I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.050" end="01:15:01.699" style="s2">maybe operating at about 10 percent of</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.030" end="01:15:03.500" style="s2">the capacity of just normal human beings</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.699" end="01:15:04.909" style="s2">and then of course we actually have some</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.500" end="01:15:06.409" style="s2">pretty high quality stuff to take it up</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.909" end="01:15:09.260" style="s2">a notch not a lot like we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.409" end="01:15:13.610" style="s2">about going up 50% but taking it up say</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.260" end="01:15:15.130" style="s2">7% at the level of say how children are</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.610" end="01:15:17.120" style="s2">parented we have much more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.130" end="01:15:18.739" style="s2">capacity to actually know what the</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.120" end="01:15:19.909" style="s2">developmental stages are and what kinds</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.739" end="01:15:21.590" style="s2">of things are appropriate certain</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.909" end="01:15:24.320" style="s2">developmental stages at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.590" end="01:15:25.610" style="s2">nutrition and things like that and now</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.320" end="01:15:27.469" style="s2">moving into the institutional side</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.610" end="01:15:29.870" style="s2">there&#39;s like the mesh between those two</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.469" end="01:15:32.390" style="s2">is the institutional fabric that sits on</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.870" end="01:15:34.280" style="s2">top of human development and human</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.390" end="01:15:35.960" style="s2">relationship I was just yesterday having</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.280" end="01:15:37.280" style="s2">a chat with somebody who has what</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.960" end="01:15:40.580" style="s2">appears to be some really sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.280" end="01:15:42.800" style="s2">technology for how groups of individuals</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.580" end="01:15:44.510" style="s2">who have very distinct perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.800" end="01:15:46.850" style="s2">meaning even to the level of distinct</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.510" end="01:15:49.400" style="s2">epistemological frameworks can actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.850" end="01:15:51.170" style="s2">be facilitated into extremely effective</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.400" end="01:15:53.000" style="s2">collective intelligence the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.170" end="01:15:54.350" style="s2">stuff at SF I kind of found this up</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.000" end="01:15:56.360" style="s2">having to deal with but at a much higher</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.350" end="01:15:57.949" style="s2">level and quite diverse I think you</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.360" end="01:15:59.120" style="s2">could grab a Christian fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.949" end="01:16:01.280" style="s2">and put him in a room with an atheist</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.120" end="01:16:03.140" style="s2">well as a part of a group of seven and</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.280" end="01:16:05.500" style="s2">through this facilitation process</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.140" end="01:16:07.489" style="s2">actually gets something which has a</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.500" end="01:16:09.650" style="s2">truly functional collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.489" end="01:16:11.810" style="s2">and so this is an example of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.650" end="01:16:15.050" style="s2">technology it&#39;s it frankly it&#39;s a psycho</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.810" end="01:16:16.330" style="s2">technology and so the collection of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.050" end="01:16:18.100" style="s2">what I would</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.330" end="01:16:19.750" style="s2">the technologies of healing of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.100" end="01:16:21.820" style="s2">technologies of sovereignty that bring</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.750" end="01:16:23.680" style="s2">human beings up to the level of being</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.820" end="01:16:26.230" style="s2">able to simply participate being able to</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.680" end="01:16:29.020" style="s2">say be not triggered by things that make</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.230" end="01:16:31.870" style="s2">them emotionally triggered or to be able</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.020" end="01:16:33.880" style="s2">to not be bound to a particular way of</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.870" end="01:16:36.610" style="s2">saying things but able to try to listen</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.880" end="01:16:38.470" style="s2">to what is being said thoughtfully and</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.610" end="01:16:40.330" style="s2">wonder and curiosity about what might be</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.470" end="01:16:42.340" style="s2">possible even if what&#39;s being said is</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.330" end="01:16:43.870" style="s2">nonsense I&#39;m just trying to listen to</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.340" end="01:16:46.060" style="s2">anything that could be useful like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.870" end="01:16:47.440" style="s2">set of techniques has been kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.060" end="01:16:48.400" style="s2">already worked through we just got to</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.440" end="01:16:50.260" style="s2">collect them and bring them together</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.400" end="01:16:51.880" style="s2">throw out the trash because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.260" end="01:16:52.990" style="s2">still a lot of trash but there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.880" end="01:16:54.520" style="s2">out there who&#39;ve been doing that work</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.990" end="01:16:56.020" style="s2">now for decades and it&#39;s not bad and</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.520" end="01:16:58.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot better there wasn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.020" end="01:17:00.340" style="s2">nineteen ten and then the set of</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.660" end="01:17:01.990" style="s2">technologies that are associated with</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.340" end="01:17:04.150" style="s2">being bringing groups together in</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.990" end="01:17:07.840" style="s2">deliberative process of being able to</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.150" end="01:17:09.160" style="s2">actually get a synergistic capacity all</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.840" end="01:17:11.590" style="s2">of it is much larger than some of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.160" end="01:17:13.180" style="s2">parts in collective intelligence is also</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.590" end="01:17:14.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot and they&#39;re pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.180" end="01:17:17.170" style="s2">I&#39;m currently in the process of actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.980" end="01:17:18.670" style="s2">going out and first-person experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.170" end="01:17:20.050" style="s2">a number of them and then endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.670" end="01:17:21.760" style="s2">find a way to curate the ones that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.050" end="01:17:23.710" style="s2">most effective and then recursively</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.760" end="01:17:26.230" style="s2">using them to bring groups together</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.710" end="01:17:28.180" style="s2">using these techniques to then give</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.230" end="01:17:29.560" style="s2">insight into what might be a deeper and</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.180" end="01:17:30.640" style="s2">better way of doing it and then the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.560" end="01:17:32.860" style="s2">third piece which i think is actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.640" end="01:17:34.270" style="s2">rather interesting is kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.860" end="01:17:35.950" style="s2">inverse of this problem of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.270" end="01:17:38.200" style="s2">globalization of civilization and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.950" end="01:17:39.700" style="s2">that in principle everybody can be</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.200" end="01:17:43.750" style="s2">involved you can find the right people</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.700" end="01:17:47.140" style="s2">imagine if Facebook didn&#39;t soccer dream</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.750" end="01:17:49.420" style="s2">on boy that is astounding like how</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.140" end="01:17:50.320" style="s2">extraordinarily Facebook sucks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.420" end="01:17:51.490" style="s2">actually if you thought about the</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.320" end="01:17:53.830" style="s2">potential so just think about this you</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.490" end="01:17:55.600" style="s2">know uh ramanuja right you do the story</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.830" end="01:17:57.610" style="s2">of him oh yeah we had the mathematician</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.600" end="01:17:59.680" style="s2">that&#39;s before the listeners we had this</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.610" end="01:18:03.370" style="s2">really great story of this guy who was a</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.680" end="01:18:05.200" style="s2">like way way out the charts asymmetric</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.370" end="01:18:07.420" style="s2">genius in mathematics it happened to be</p>

<p begin="01:20:37.140" end="01:20:41.250" style="s2">it&#39;s the means by which we deplete our</p>

<p begin="01:21:05.370" end="01:21:08.280" style="s2">obviously you and I have talked about</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.719" end="01:21:11.940" style="s2">this particular question quite a bit and</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.280" end="01:21:14.100" style="s2">even just this morning I was sharpening</p>

<p begin="01:21:19.290" end="01:21:23.969" style="s2">bit more abstract first and then come</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.140" end="01:21:26.580" style="s2">back down to the tactical strategic</p>

<p begin="01:21:26.580" end="01:21:31.200" style="s2">like to make two changes to your</p>

<p begin="01:21:31.200" end="01:21:35.400" style="s2">and fifty it&#39;s probably gonna be more</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.700" end="01:21:37.590" style="s2">like 1,500 to 3,000 and second I&#39;d</p>

<p begin="01:21:37.590" end="01:21:42.570" style="s2">like Vulcan Spartans or something like</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.440" end="01:21:45.239" style="s2">that okay that&#39;s fair enough let&#39;s remap</p>

<p begin="01:21:51.719" end="01:21:55.739" style="s2">friend you have to improve gotta have</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.640" end="01:21:56.969" style="s2">both even better the theory and by the</p>

<p begin="01:22:02.640" end="01:22:06.350" style="s2">I&#39;ll just kind of go in that direction</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.540" end="01:22:08.640" style="s2">and it looks a lot like early</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.350" end="01:22:11.450" style="s2">Christianity with a lot less bloodshed</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.640" end="01:22:14.219" style="s2">and on an exponential growth curve the</p>

<p begin="01:22:47.710" end="01:22:53.500" style="s2">but it has all of it it has kids being</p>

<p begin="01:25:09.889" end="01:25:14.330" style="s2">actually a pretty sizable population of</p>

<p begin="01:25:39.770" end="01:25:44.330" style="s2">technologies are not radically difficult</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.830" end="01:25:46.010" style="s2">for people to learn how to get into just</p>

<p begin="01:25:46.010" end="01:25:51.139" style="s2">immigration that happened in the United</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.050" end="01:25:53.840" style="s2">States in the period between say 1840</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.139" end="01:25:55.340" style="s2">and 1940 my great-grandfather</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:57.770" style="s2">but maybe great-great but something in</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.340" end="01:25:59.989" style="s2">that order was like 9 and spoke Russian</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.770" end="01:26:02.590" style="s2">and it was on a boat by himself in land</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.989" end="01:26:06.320" style="s2">in Galveston Texas and became a thriving</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.590" end="01:26:07.940" style="s2">shopkeeper in the art of his life so the</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.320" end="01:26:10.730" style="s2">capacity of people to immigrate and</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.940" end="01:26:13.130" style="s2">upgrade into new psycho technologies is</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.730" end="01:26:14.480" style="s2">historically actually not radically</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.130" end="01:26:17.570" style="s2">difficult it ain&#39;t easy but is now</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.480" end="01:26:19.639" style="s2">radically difficult and that&#39;s path one</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.570" end="01:26:21.050" style="s2">ISO path one is basically you build</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.639" end="01:26:22.699" style="s2">something that is complete</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.050" end="01:26:24.139" style="s2">that actually has all the stuffs and</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.699" end="01:26:26.090" style="s2">this is important because if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.139" end="01:26:27.830" style="s2">complete at a complex systems level then</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.090" end="01:26:28.880" style="s2">you may be throwing externalities you</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.830" end="01:26:31.610" style="s2">don&#39;t understand access to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.880" end="01:26:33.110" style="s2">homeostatic and has the ability at least</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.610" end="01:26:34.280" style="s2">perceived the loop that is connecting</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.110" end="01:26:35.929" style="s2">with does it have to be completely</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.280" end="01:26:37.730" style="s2">closed or just has to include all the</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.929" end="01:26:40.280" style="s2">aspects and then you begin the process</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.730" end="01:26:41.690" style="s2">of immigration and scaling and you scale</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.280" end="01:26:44.000" style="s2">both organically directly in that</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.690" end="01:26:45.679" style="s2">location and also to the degree to which</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.000" end="01:26:46.410" style="s2">you can actually have this be very</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.679" end="01:26:48.690" style="s2">prototype</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.410" end="01:26:50.160" style="s2">or let&#39;s say for example you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.690" end="01:26:52.350" style="s2">the first one in San Francisco you watch</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.160" end="01:26:53.940" style="s2">the first one in Virginia but then</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.350" end="01:26:56.490" style="s2">Oakland from San Francisco comes and</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.940" end="01:26:58.530" style="s2">wants to try and you have say forty</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.490" end="01:27:00.660" style="s2">people from San Francisco come live in</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.530" end="01:27:02.820" style="s2">this environment for a couple of years</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.660" end="01:27:05.430" style="s2">until they&#39;ve really in their cells have</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.820" end="01:27:07.110" style="s2">absorbed the culture and all the</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.430" end="01:27:08.730" style="s2">techniques and technologies that have to</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.110" end="01:27:10.230" style="s2">be brought they then go out and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.730" end="01:27:12.240" style="s2">forty people go with them like good</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.230" end="01:27:13.890" style="s2">old-fashioned Greek city-states had that</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.240" end="01:27:15.960" style="s2">characteristic by the way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.890" end="01:27:18.060" style="s2">actually two great precedents I can</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.960" end="01:27:20.250" style="s2">think of the biggest one historically</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.060" end="01:27:22.020" style="s2">that&#39;s how the hunter bat gatherer bands</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.250" end="01:27:23.910" style="s2">did it right they didn&#39;t clone</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.020" end="01:27:25.140" style="s2">themselves right these got to the point</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.910" end="01:27:27.210" style="s2">where they were too big for their</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.140" end="01:27:28.860" style="s2">business model and they fissioned right</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.210" end="01:27:30.810" style="s2">and so maybe you don&#39;t think about</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.860" end="01:27:32.040" style="s2">cloning but you rather you think about</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.810" end="01:27:34.110" style="s2">fissioning and it may be that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.040" end="01:27:36.180" style="s2">fission component decides to go to San</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.110" end="01:27:38.100" style="s2">Francisco right part of the ethos of</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.180" end="01:27:40.440" style="s2">spreading and the other example</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.100" end="01:27:42.780" style="s2">modern-day are like Mennonites right</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.440" end="01:27:45.270" style="s2">whole families of Mennonites pack up</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.780" end="01:27:47.580" style="s2">from Pennsylvania and move to Mexico</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.270" end="01:27:49.140" style="s2">there are Mennonites in Mexico there are</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.580" end="01:27:51.150" style="s2">now Mennonites in Highland County</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.140" end="01:27:53.580" style="s2">Virginia who some of them came down from</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.150" end="01:27:57.330" style="s2">Canada right so think about it rather</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.580" end="01:27:59.640" style="s2">than planting colonies externally you</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.330" end="01:28:01.410" style="s2">bud them off from the mother ship and</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.640" end="01:28:03.150" style="s2">then then those of course blood off and</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.410" end="01:28:05.310" style="s2">you have an exponential growth right</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.150" end="01:28:06.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve got mentioned John for Vicki in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.310" end="01:28:08.730" style="s2">past a few times and remember I</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.750" end="01:28:12.210" style="s2">mentioned that he&#39;s characterizing it as</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.730" end="01:28:13.860" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.210" end="01:28:15.630" style="s2">think one of the things that is not is</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.860" end="01:28:17.310" style="s2">obvious I think it least wasn&#39;t to us</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.630" end="01:28:19.260" style="s2">back when we talk about the past is one</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.310" end="01:28:21.720" style="s2">of the primary values when the primary</p>

<p begin="01:28:21.720" end="01:28:26.490" style="s2">they&#39;re participating in this game be</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.220" end="01:28:28.830" style="s2">environment is a radical upgrade and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.490" end="01:28:31.610" style="s2">meaningfulness of their lived experience</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.830" end="01:28:35.670" style="s2">their life will in fact be and feel</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.610" end="01:28:37.800" style="s2">meaningful and that&#39;s a primary currency</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.670" end="01:28:39.480" style="s2">of this culture so the invitation you</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.800" end="01:28:41.700" style="s2">know you&#39;re sitting in San Francisco and</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.480" end="01:28:43.650" style="s2">and yes if you join this culture and you</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.700" end="01:28:46.260" style="s2">begin to participate in it you get</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.650" end="01:28:48.750" style="s2">better friends who are more considerate</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.260" end="01:28:50.610" style="s2">and are more capable of interacting with</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.750" end="01:28:53.190" style="s2">you you have the possibility of finding</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.610" end="01:28:54.960" style="s2">mates who are more likely to be better</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.190" end="01:28:56.420" style="s2">parents you can actually raise better</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.960" end="01:28:57.800" style="s2">kids well fill in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.420" end="01:29:00.350" style="s2">like all the things that are part of</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.800" end="01:29:02.960" style="s2">what just living a simple meaningful</p>

<p begin="01:29:02.960" end="01:29:08.360" style="s2">day life will actually be felt and will</p>

<p begin="01:29:08.360" end="01:29:10.969" style="s2">thing that will of course make it rather</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.949" end="01:29:13.340" style="s2">attractive of course that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.969" end="01:29:17.390" style="s2">Christianity grew from right you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.340" end="01:29:19.070" style="s2">yes I was a into my mind a bogus meaning</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.390" end="01:29:22.040" style="s2">but it was a meaning that was</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.070" end="01:29:24.620" style="s2">large-scale and attractive well I mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.040" end="01:29:26.719" style="s2">parts of it were bogus but I mean in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.620" end="01:29:29.660" style="s2">context of early Christianity you were</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.719" end="01:29:32.210" style="s2">living in a society where throwing</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.660" end="01:29:34.100" style="s2">people to the Lions was entertainment</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.210" end="01:29:35.660" style="s2">for everyone so the Christians were</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.100" end="01:29:37.850" style="s2">actually entering into a context where</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.660" end="01:29:39.830" style="s2">the people around them were not likely</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.850" end="01:29:41.989" style="s2">to sort of stab them in the eyeball for</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.830" end="01:29:43.880" style="s2">accidently forgetting their lunch that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.989" end="01:29:45.320" style="s2">a pretty significant real upgrade in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.880" end="01:29:47.420" style="s2">quality of your life yeah the community</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.320" end="01:29:50.060" style="s2">was good I was just argue that their</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.420" end="01:29:51.800" style="s2">metaphysics was baloney but it may be</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.060" end="01:29:53.780" style="s2">irrelevant actually as it turns out</p>

<p begin="01:29:53.780" end="01:29:56.719" style="s2">not well this is where the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.310" end="01:29:58.520" style="s2">thing is because what&#39;s really neat</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.719" end="01:29:59.540" style="s2">about the story of game B is that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.520" end="01:30:01.880" style="s2">also get the advantage of actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.540" end="01:30:03.890" style="s2">having a really seriously kick-ass</p>

<p begin="01:30:13.400" end="01:30:17.630" style="s2">really cool advantage if you want a</p>

<p begin="01:30:27.290" end="01:30:31.190" style="s2">having now over the past three years is</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.850" end="01:30:33.350" style="s2">that a large piece of what happens in</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.190" end="01:30:35.960" style="s2">game B is that it&#39;s actually extremely</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.350" end="01:30:37.719" style="s2">simple and actually kind of slow it</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.960" end="01:30:39.380" style="s2">moves at a much slower pace because</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.719" end="01:30:42.469" style="s2">that&#39;s almost like the pace of</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.380" end="01:30:45.260" style="s2">meaningfulness and most of what you</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.469" end="01:30:46.880" style="s2">discover is that it&#39;s shockingly simple</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.260" end="01:30:51.410" style="s2">is just that the world that we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.880" end="01:30:54.800" style="s2">in is hyper hyper complicated so we get</p>

<p begin="01:30:54.800" end="01:30:57.620" style="s2">is them in the last piece I me just put</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.480" end="01:30:58.910" style="s2">this last piece in and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.620" end="01:31:00.320" style="s2">probably just tie it on or at least for</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.910" end="01:31:01.760" style="s2">the moment all right by the way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.320" end="01:31:03.620" style="s2">a whole other giant story to explain</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.760" end="01:31:07.430" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying here but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.620" end="01:31:09.080" style="s2">good reasons to believe that the kind of</p>

<p begin="01:31:10.940" end="01:31:16.670" style="s2">actually be vastly vastly more let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.180" end="01:31:19.730" style="s2">call it competitive in old fashioned</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.670" end="01:31:21.290" style="s2">game a terms visa the game a to just</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.730" end="01:31:23.180" style="s2">kind of extract it a little bit just</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.290" end="01:31:26.300" style="s2">gonna give a little meat to that bone if</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.180" end="01:31:28.460" style="s2">you look at the arc of game a just go</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.300" end="01:31:31.370" style="s2">with straight military history very</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.460" end="01:31:33.490" style="s2">concrete for a long time military</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.370" end="01:31:37.790" style="s2">history was built around either</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.490" end="01:31:41.300" style="s2">physicality or around tactics or around</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.790" end="01:31:43.580" style="s2">a certain level of strategy and weaponry</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.300" end="01:31:45.170" style="s2">host everyone semi weaponry may have</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.580" end="01:31:47.150" style="s2">made a difference and then they begin to</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.170" end="01:31:50.120" style="s2">see some movement and there are things</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.150" end="01:31:52.490" style="s2">not that long ago where technology began</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.120" end="01:31:54.230" style="s2">to show up as playing an independent and</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.490" end="01:31:56.060" style="s2">increasingly important role in the story</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.230" end="01:31:58.400" style="s2">of how you actually beat the other guy</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.060" end="01:32:00.500" style="s2">about 1450 he can say started to become</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.400" end="01:32:01.640" style="s2">significant yeah I mean that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.500" end="01:32:03.140" style="s2">long ago and then of course you just</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.640" end="01:32:06.830" style="s2">kind of fast forward and get to our</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.140" end="01:32:07.820" style="s2">World War two where the emergence of</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.830" end="01:32:09.470" style="s2">where they called the pointy headed</p>

<p begin="01:32:09.470" end="01:32:12.830" style="s2">geeks and I think they&#39;re probably just</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.030" end="01:32:14.210" style="s2">talking about Alan Turing and the guys</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.830" end="01:32:16.130" style="s2">down at the Manhattan Project</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.210" end="01:32:18.140" style="s2">holy shit like those guys actually kind</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.130" end="01:32:20.960" style="s2">of won the war and it didn&#39;t take long</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.140" end="01:32:25.010" style="s2">to realize that the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.960" end="01:32:27.710" style="s2">people who are capable of innovation has</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.010" end="01:32:29.450" style="s2">vastly outstripped physicality</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.710" end="01:32:31.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the outstripped tactics it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.450" end="01:32:33.560" style="s2">fact easy to the point where it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.250" end="01:32:35.030" style="s2">to be vastly outstripping all possible</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.560" end="01:32:37.700" style="s2">strategy we can speak about that</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.030" end="01:32:40.610" style="s2">detailed like but the basic point is as</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.700" end="01:32:43.250" style="s2">it turns out game be actually also ends</p>
