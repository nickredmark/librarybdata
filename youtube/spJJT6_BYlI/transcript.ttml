<p begin="00:00:38.399" end="00:00:51.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a dialectical stage of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">development and of course the skill sets</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.539" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">people discount this because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">they claim it&#39;s only a phase in formal</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.860" end="00:01:14.570" style="s2">or the movement or the growth toward</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">dialectical reasoning is then formal</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.570" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">operational reasoning and so he makes a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:24.630" style="s2">claim that it should be as discreet lyst</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">age or a level jump up from formal</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.630" end="00:01:31.740" style="s2">operations so there&#39;s to look at work</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:38.780" style="s2">from the general to the more specific</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.740" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">there&#39;s two phases that announce the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.780" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">full-blown dialectical stage of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">cognitive development in this type of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:53.070" style="s2">research in the first phase is this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">pre dialectical is just ordinary dualism</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:02:03.719" style="s2">and in the ordinary dualism phase we see</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">that people are reasoning from one or</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.719" end="00:02:13.220" style="s2">the other category in a dualistic pair</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:16.790" style="s2">so that people might bias</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.220" end="00:02:22.970" style="s2">their judgment on a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.790" end="00:02:27.220" style="s2">perspective whereas other people might</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.970" end="00:02:34.100" style="s2">bias their perspective on an objective</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.220" end="00:02:36.740" style="s2">perspective now for the most part most</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.100" end="00:02:42.020" style="s2">people dance back and forth depending</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.740" end="00:02:46.280" style="s2">upon what problem they&#39;re looking at and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.020" end="00:02:49.640" style="s2">so dualism means that do that people are</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.280" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">are biased in one of the other but they</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.640" end="00:02:53.570" style="s2">can dance back and forth without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:03:02.740" style="s2">so that there isn&#39;t there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.570" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">there&#39;s unconscious bias but that both</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.740" end="00:03:12.260" style="s2">sides of the argument or both roles are</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:16.190" style="s2">available to people so within you go you</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.260" end="00:03:19.340" style="s2">might go to a science class and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.190" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s an objective</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.340" end="00:03:23.300" style="s2">perspective required and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:25.489" style="s2">go to English class and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.300" end="00:03:30.280" style="s2">subjective perspective so the people can</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.489" end="00:03:33.350" style="s2">dance back and forth but in each</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.280" end="00:03:37.130" style="s2">individual case of what what their role</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.350" end="00:03:39.560" style="s2">is or what their domain is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.130" end="00:03:48.700" style="s2">taking one half one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.560" end="00:03:55.180" style="s2">dualistic perspective so the the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.700" end="00:03:55.180" style="s2">phase is a very subtle phases is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.900" end="00:04:02.989" style="s2">people begin to see this dance this</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.959" end="00:04:05.660" style="s2">dance becomes apparent to them and their</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.989" end="00:04:12.910" style="s2">reasoning becomes more relativistic so</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.660" end="00:04:12.910" style="s2">they start to qualify their arguments</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.780" end="00:04:16.780" style="s2">arguments</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.690" end="00:04:25.250" style="s2">they start to qualify their judgments</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.470" end="00:04:40.650" style="s2">okay they start to include context so we</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.350" end="00:04:43.380" style="s2">might say well reasoning from this</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.650" end="00:04:45.510" style="s2">perspective I would have answer a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:48.420" style="s2">reasoning from that perspective I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.510" end="00:04:51.540" style="s2">nuance be then I would want to add a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.420" end="00:04:59.450" style="s2">little taste of the perspective of scene</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.540" end="00:05:08.430" style="s2">so you get this more complex but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.450" end="00:05:14.130" style="s2">less firm orientation toward the answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.430" end="00:05:18.660" style="s2">of the truth and so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.130" end="00:05:21.480" style="s2">relativistic stage which is aware of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.660" end="00:05:25.200" style="s2">this dance and tries to contextualize</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.480" end="00:05:33.650" style="s2">the multiple perspectives and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.200" end="00:05:37.890" style="s2">what then becomes the dialectical mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.650" end="00:05:40.470" style="s2">because this dance is not very</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.890" end="00:05:46.340" style="s2">satisfactory relativism is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.470" end="00:05:49.230" style="s2">satisfactory and so so the move toward</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.340" end="00:06:03.770" style="s2">dialectical thinking which is a movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.230" end="00:06:03.770" style="s2">a effective movement let&#39;s say movement</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.860" end="00:06:17.940" style="s2">toward a greater understanding is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:21.230" style="s2">is sought so there&#39;s in the Oh broad</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.940" end="00:06:23.730" style="s2">scheme of it people are initially</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.230" end="00:06:26.040" style="s2">dualistic in their reasoning although</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.730" end="00:06:29.790" style="s2">they can dance between different</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.040" end="00:06:31.409" style="s2">dualistic poles then they become aware</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.790" end="00:06:35.369" style="s2">of this dance and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.409" end="00:06:38.899" style="s2">tends to be relativistic and then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.369" end="00:06:42.899" style="s2">pressures for problem solving or</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.899" end="00:06:45.959" style="s2">resolving the ambiguity in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.899" end="00:06:48.749" style="s2">relativistic stage creates what</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.959" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">facetious would call dialectical mind or</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.749" end="00:06:55.229" style="s2">dialectical reasoning so there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:07:03.149" style="s2">this in its this level that he would</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.229" end="00:07:17.999" style="s2">argue is a discrete stage beyond formal</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.149" end="00:07:22.339" style="s2">operational facetious has labeled or</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.999" end="00:07:28.879" style="s2">categorized two types of dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.339" end="00:07:28.879" style="s2">reasoning and he categorizes that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.179" end="00:07:38.029" style="s2">dialectical so beyond the dualistic and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.789" end="00:07:47.329" style="s2">relativistic stages and then he</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.029" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">categorizes late stage dialectical and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.329" end="00:07:58.490" style="s2">so we can look at those in a grid form</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:08:03.989" style="s2">here I&#39;m not a very successful line but</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.490" end="00:08:08.239" style="s2">there we go and so in dialectical stage</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.989" end="00:08:15.989" style="s2">we see the person is reasoning through</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.239" end="00:08:20.099" style="s2">logical categories that there&#39;s a clear</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.989" end="00:08:27.689" style="s2">on reasoning profit process through</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.099" end="00:08:30.209" style="s2">thesis antithesis and synthesis that if</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.689" end="00:08:36.649" style="s2">you diagram their arguments this is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.209" end="00:08:40.680" style="s2">clearly their progression that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.649" end="00:08:43.380" style="s2">systems or the organization of reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.680" end="00:08:46.939" style="s2">that they end up with tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.380" end="00:08:46.939" style="s2">composite structures</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:09:01.110" style="s2">or we could say that the approach is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.730" end="00:09:03.420" style="s2">constructivist so they build up</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.110" end="00:09:06.450" style="s2">information so this concept of building</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.420" end="00:09:13.190" style="s2">up for building on ideas in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.450" end="00:09:17.490" style="s2">dialectical way the end product is</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.190" end="00:09:20.910" style="s2">synthetic not surprising because this</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.490" end="00:09:27.540" style="s2">move towards our synthesis or we might</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.910" end="00:09:31.110" style="s2">say it&#39;s algorithmic that makes it still</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.540" end="00:09:35.220" style="s2">linear so that everything that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.110" end="00:09:37.290" style="s2">included in the premises is built up to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.220" end="00:09:41.610" style="s2">a synthetic form that completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.290" end="00:09:45.690" style="s2">includes all the pieces so like nested</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.610" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">sets or transcend and include so they</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.690" end="00:10:00.590" style="s2">end up with a transcendent hole which</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:07.100" style="s2">gives them the impression that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.590" end="00:10:07.100" style="s2">itself is a transcendent the game thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.910" end="00:10:23.510" style="s2">and that they operate primarily through</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.510" end="00:10:27.080" style="s2">the lens of theory and their</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.510" end="00:10:33.660" style="s2">understanding is that reality is</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.080" end="00:10:36.980" style="s2">perspectival but that there is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.660" end="00:10:40.710" style="s2">ability to get a universal perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.980" end="00:10:44.400" style="s2">perspective on a problem through this</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.710" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">process if you if you work this process</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.400" end="00:10:50.130" style="s2">long enough or hard enough or accurately</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:54.450" style="s2">enough yes that&#39;s a perspective but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.130" end="00:10:56.970" style="s2">a universal perspective and pastiches</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.450" end="00:10:58.780" style="s2">says something different happens in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.970" end="00:11:01.960" style="s2">late-stage dial</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.780" end="00:11:09.520" style="s2">ethical and the reason why don&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.960" end="00:11:13.090" style="s2">happens is that people begin to be able</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.520" end="00:11:18.070" style="s2">to see this process right so they can</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.090" end="00:11:23.160" style="s2">see this process happening in and start</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.070" end="00:11:27.340" style="s2">to undermine the constructivist approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.160" end="00:11:29.140" style="s2">because they can see that it&#39;s dependent</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.340" end="00:11:31.930" style="s2">upon these conditions which are</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.140" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">processes of the cognitive mind and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.930" end="00:11:40.630" style="s2">they move toward a different view of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.680" end="00:11:43.150" style="s2">meaning and move through or work through</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.820" end="00:12:07.270" style="s2">synthesis they start to to organize the</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.270" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">for example you will they start to</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.980" end="00:12:37.840" style="s2">that term these are all forms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.220" end="00:12:41.850" style="s2">existence instead of composite</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.840" end="00:12:45.400" style="s2">structures they have what we might call</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.850" end="00:12:51.250" style="s2">constitutive structures so these are all</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.400" end="00:12:53.980" style="s2">members not parts and instead of being</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.250" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">constructivist we see that they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:13:04.270" style="s2">emergence so constituted parts are</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.270" end="00:13:07.050" style="s2">parts</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:18.690" style="s2">instead of synthetic move we have an</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.690" end="00:13:28.300" style="s2">so if you have members not parts then</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.230" end="00:13:31.740" style="s2">the parts don&#39;t get completely included</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.300" end="00:13:35.020" style="s2">like a nested set their relationally</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.740" end="00:13:37.170" style="s2">members in a more integrated fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.020" end="00:13:42.220" style="s2">this is the way the late-stage</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.170" end="00:13:45.580" style="s2">dialectical mind is operating instead</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.500" end="00:14:02.230" style="s2">these forms of existence that is trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.940" end="00:14:03.910" style="s2">to be in a sense recapitulated instead</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.230" end="00:14:07.990" style="s2">of transcendent knowledge you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.910" end="00:14:14.700" style="s2">collective knowledge from all these</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.700" end="00:14:25.900" style="s2">operational form is meta theoretical and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.710" end="00:14:34.270" style="s2">instead of perspective a universal</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.900" end="00:14:41.400" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s multi perspectival you</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.270" end="00:14:41.400" style="s2">can see some of this bomb is similar to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.000" end="00:14:55.630" style="s2">some of the evolutionary changes that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.830" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">see that we talked about before so this</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.630" end="00:15:01.390" style="s2">is Bush the fishes is schematic just to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:07.590" style="s2">give you a little preview we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.390" end="00:15:12.150" style="s2">contrast this to what I would call the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.590" end="00:15:19.140" style="s2">transition to the next movement which</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.150" end="00:15:20.830" style="s2">are calling on to logic to see just how</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.140" end="00:15:24.190" style="s2">crisp</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.830" end="00:15:26.980" style="s2">can be made between dialectical and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.190" end="00:15:30.060" style="s2">ontological and just to see what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.980" end="00:15:33.430" style="s2">think so instead of logical categories</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.060" end="00:15:40.650" style="s2">or forms of existence we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.430" end="00:15:45.880" style="s2">ontological categories which are</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.650" end="00:15:49.830" style="s2">temporal tones like anterior and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.880" end="00:15:54.370" style="s2">posterior so this is the first time that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.830" end="00:15:58.420" style="s2">time itself is incorporated as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.370" end="00:16:01.690" style="s2">category and contextualized it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.420" end="00:16:06.790" style="s2">and also now instead of constructivist</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.690" end="00:16:15.910" style="s2">or constitute constitutive structures we</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.790" end="00:16:19.300" style="s2">have ontogenetic relations in generative</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.910" end="00:16:26.070" style="s2">processes instead of synthetic or</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.300" end="00:16:26.070" style="s2">integrity dynamics we have generative</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.660" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">processes or process dynamics instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.190" end="00:16:49.710" style="s2">transcendent holes of the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:57.910" style="s2">prior whole we have mutually generative</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.710" end="00:17:00.580" style="s2">holes and parts and then emphasis here</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.910" end="00:17:05.920" style="s2">is on generative the dynamics between</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.580" end="00:17:08.080" style="s2">the holes in part instead of the notion</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.920" end="00:17:11.620" style="s2">of the transcendent knowledge or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.080" end="00:17:19.810" style="s2">goal of collective knowledge we have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.620" end="00:17:25.260" style="s2">recognition of implicit knowing that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.810" end="00:17:28.260" style="s2">knower is implicit in the process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.260" end="00:17:28.260" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.010" end="00:17:36.140" style="s2">whereas in dialectical reasoning the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.530" end="00:17:39.830" style="s2">methodology of argument is theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.140" end="00:17:41.630" style="s2">in late-stage dialectical its emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.830" end="00:17:45.100" style="s2">is on neta theory of the move toward</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.630" end="00:17:51.340" style="s2">meta theory and the ontological mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.100" end="00:17:54.770" style="s2">these are considered to be creative</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.340" end="00:17:59.270" style="s2">imaginaries and so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.770" end="00:18:03.290" style="s2">profound shift between the situation in</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.270" end="00:18:05.900" style="s2">both of these where theory is a tool to</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.290" end="00:18:09.860" style="s2">get at reality and that the theory</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.900" end="00:18:13.940" style="s2">somehow is reality to this move that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.860" end="00:18:16.940" style="s2">creative imagination it imaginaries that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.940" end="00:18:20.600" style="s2">you use your creative imagination to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.940" end="00:18:22.610" style="s2">bring up certain aspects of reality that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.600" end="00:18:24.650" style="s2">may be more relevant meaningful or</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.610" end="00:18:27.160" style="s2">useful but there is this notion this</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.650" end="00:18:31.880" style="s2">complete transparency that we are always</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.160" end="00:18:35.960" style="s2">creating theories in imaginary ways as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.880" end="00:18:38.180" style="s2">tool to make inquiry and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.960" end="00:18:40.010" style="s2">justification for that is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.180" end="00:18:42.530" style="s2">situated in being and we have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.010" end="00:18:44.900" style="s2">implicit knowing and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.530" end="00:18:49.880" style="s2">phrase I like to use is that whereas</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.900" end="00:18:54.710" style="s2">before the theories have us as if they</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.880" end="00:18:58.490" style="s2">are somehow more real than just our</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.710" end="00:19:01.790" style="s2">imaginations afterwards we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.490" end="00:19:07.070" style="s2">completely aware that we are using our</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.790" end="00:19:14.630" style="s2">mind in a creative way as a instrument</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.070" end="00:19:17.690" style="s2">of inquiry and in these final categories</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.630" end="00:19:20.030" style="s2">here whereas originally there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.690" end="00:19:24.170" style="s2">concept of a universal perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.030" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">illness versus a multi or hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.170" end="00:19:32.330" style="s2">perspectival then in the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:36.380" style="s2">mind the basic structure of the cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.330" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">is seen as being a perspectival or open</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.380" end="00:19:42.840" style="s2">or what gabster likes to say is</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:47.290" style="s2">diaphanous</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.840" end="00:19:50.590" style="s2">and so I just set this out that before</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.290" end="00:19:55.150" style="s2">we go on to the next section of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.590" end="00:19:59.230" style="s2">video so you might be able to see some</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.150" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">of these aspects as being important in</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.230" end="00:20:08.770" style="s2">what the meaning based developmental</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:15.220" style="s2">cognitive models see as some of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.220" end="00:20:23.559" style="s2">capacity so just be aware and look for</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.350" end="00:20:34.750" style="s2">some of the indications of these aspects</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.559" end="00:20:37.770" style="s2">of what I&#39;m calling an ontological art</p>
