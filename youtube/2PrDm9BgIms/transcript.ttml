<p begin="00:00:04.319" end="00:00:12.660" style="s2">today I&#39;m going to talk about feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.670" end="00:00:15.240" style="s2">inadequacy I am realizing all the places</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.660" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">where I feel that way and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.240" end="00:00:19.770" style="s2">trying to become better in those areas</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:23.210" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to accept myself for</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.770" end="00:00:26.000" style="s2">exactly where I&#39;m at and also just</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.210" end="00:00:29.250" style="s2">seeing the effects that&#39;s had on my life</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.000" end="00:00:33.780" style="s2">Trump getting into office which I</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.250" end="00:00:36.899" style="s2">realize is old news but he has the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">opposite of whatever I have like he</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.899" end="00:00:42.540" style="s2">thinks he is so he&#39;s the best at</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:44.190" style="s2">everything I mean that&#39;s his ego and he</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.540" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">clearly is not he&#39;s not even good at</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.190" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">Bizness which is the one thing he should</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">be good at he&#39;s clear bankruptcy how</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:53.250" style="s2">many times which I realized was maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:54.989" style="s2">the point but whereas it&#39;s not where you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.250" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">actually are that you&#39;re judged on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.989" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">based on where you think you are and all</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">the areas of my life that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:03.750" style="s2">overcompensate in because I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">I&#39;m not as good in them one of the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.750" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">not even the greatest example but one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:11.330" style="s2">the ones that stands out of my my memory</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:15.470" style="s2">is going to an acquaintance&#39;s wedding</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.330" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">and yours in years ago with my ex and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.470" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">discussing like how much we should put</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:21.570" style="s2">in the card for money and I put in a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:23.939" style="s2">hundred dollars and at no point have I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">been rich so that was a lot of money but</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.939" end="00:01:27.630" style="s2">I thought that was like what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">people were supposed to do and I got</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.630" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">this like beautiful thank-you card they</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">divorced within a year but um that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:38.850" style="s2">don&#39;t feel good about having given that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">money because I felt like I had to like</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.850" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">I was obligated to give it whereas if I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">had put in fifty bucks which would have</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">been way more reasonable I wouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">be thinking about it now but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">idea that I felt like I wasn&#39;t someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">who gives a good gifts and I wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:01:57.329" style="s2">therefore I had to overcompensate and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.979" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in the moment I&#39;m like oh well</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.329" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">give more than everyone else I was it</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:01.890" style="s2">was the opposite I felt like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">gave that amount like I didn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">much people gave for a birthday present</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:07.950" style="s2">you spent like 20 40 bucks so for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:09.539" style="s2">wedding President should be you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.950" end="00:02:12.750" style="s2">like fifty hundred and there was two of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">us so like at least two hundred and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:15.959" style="s2">like a best friend</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:18.200" style="s2">anyway but that feeling it&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.959" end="00:02:20.370" style="s2">much I gave it was that feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.200" end="00:02:22.110" style="s2">feeling inadequate and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.370" end="00:02:26.129" style="s2">overcompensating and I feel like I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.110" end="00:02:30.209" style="s2">that in a lot of ways I feel like I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.129" end="00:02:31.950" style="s2">low-energy so I try to like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.209" end="00:02:35.189" style="s2">contributing I try to kind of push</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.950" end="00:02:37.829" style="s2">through that and give too much and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.189" end="00:02:41.189" style="s2">and that in accepting where I&#39;m at and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.829" end="00:02:43.140" style="s2">also I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s better to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.189" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">actually know where you are on the curve</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.140" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">like to know whether you are better than</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:49.739" style="s2">average or worse than average or your</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:51.389" style="s2">average whether it&#39;s the need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.739" end="00:02:55.819" style="s2">actually know that&#39;s the problem or</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.389" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">whether it&#39;s then not knowing because</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.819" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">their current areas of my life I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:02.599" style="s2">like to know where I fall on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">spectrum like where on the normal curve</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.599" end="00:03:09.269" style="s2">am I and I don&#39;t know why that would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:12.689" style="s2">helpful but like I feel when I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.269" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">group of people and we&#39;re all doing work</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.689" end="00:03:17.549" style="s2">together especially over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:19.949" style="s2">that I don&#39;t give enough I&#39;m not one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.549" end="00:03:21.900" style="s2">the people who is a type-a personality I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.949" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">don&#39;t when those things like give a busy</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.900" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">person if you want something done give</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">it to a busy person on the opposite I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">not a busy person so I definitely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:37.620" style="s2">like needing to run like for errands for</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">the week overwhelms me and so figuring</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.620" end="00:03:40.769" style="s2">out where I am on that I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:43.829" style="s2">another one so if someone comes over to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.769" end="00:03:46.579" style="s2">my house I feel the need to clean it as</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.829" end="00:03:48.359" style="s2">I think most people do which ends up</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.579" end="00:03:50.099" style="s2">overcompensate and I don&#39;t know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.359" end="00:03:52.260" style="s2">complicated it&#39;s not like I&#39;m cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.099" end="00:03:53.970" style="s2">everything but then I go over to someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.260" end="00:03:56.430" style="s2">I feel like like if someone was to walk</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.970" end="00:03:58.470" style="s2">into my house when it&#39;s its normal way</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.430" end="00:04:00.659" style="s2">that it is that I&#39;m beyond messy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.470" end="00:04:02.250" style="s2">like a super messy person someone would</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.659" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">like condemn my house and it&#39;s nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.250" end="00:04:06.389" style="s2">near that bad like it&#39;s stacks of paper</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:11.099" style="s2">that eventually get put away I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.389" end="00:04:16.109" style="s2">hoarder I am and walking into other</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.099" end="00:04:18.539" style="s2">people&#39;s houses that didn&#39;t have time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.109" end="00:04:19.709" style="s2">prep right like my kid walks into</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.539" end="00:04:21.810" style="s2">someone&#39;s house people don&#39;t clean up</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.709" end="00:04:23.099" style="s2">for children so then I have to go over</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.810" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">and get her and seeing people as how&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.099" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">me like oh we all have young kids we all</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:29.889" style="s2">live like this I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:31.690" style="s2">like it&#39;s like it&#39;s not me being an odd</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.889" end="00:04:34.990" style="s2">equipment it&#39;s the feeling of being like</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.690" end="00:04:37.930" style="s2">I&#39;m not measuring of that like I look</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.990" end="00:04:40.570" style="s2">around at the people who look beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:42.610" style="s2">all day every day and are decked out in</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.570" end="00:04:44.440" style="s2">in amazing fashion and I&#39;m like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.610" end="00:04:47.110" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t compete with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.440" end="00:04:49.780" style="s2">I don&#39;t measure up but I don&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.110" end="00:04:52.090" style="s2">all the all the you know 80% of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.780" end="00:04:53.979" style="s2">population or maybe it&#39;s 60% of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.090" end="00:04:55.979" style="s2">population who are out in the sweatpants</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.979" end="00:04:58.900" style="s2">and t-shirts like I am like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.979" end="00:05:01.810" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not part of the like lowest</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.900" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">5% I&#39;m just there I&#39;m just you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.810" end="00:05:09.490" style="s2">average and that&#39;s fine and so this</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:11.979" style="s2">feeling of inadequacy of wear and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.490" end="00:05:18.850" style="s2">one of the other instances which bugs me</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.979" end="00:05:21.940" style="s2">is being female that I&#39;m expected to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.850" end="00:05:24.100" style="s2">more of the domestic work even when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.940" end="00:05:28.570" style="s2">don&#39;t have a partner so when I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.100" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">group of people of two genders really in</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.570" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">this case it doesn&#39;t happen so often in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:35.800" style="s2">multi gender groups because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:39.400" style="s2">dealt with a lot of their gender</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.800" end="00:05:42.849" style="s2">but women get up and start cleaning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:44.349" style="s2">the men sit around and chat and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.849" end="00:05:45.580" style="s2">like an automatic like I&#39;m like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.349" end="00:05:47.169" style="s2">sorry was that supposed to come with my</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.580" end="00:05:48.910" style="s2">extra x-chromosome was I supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.169" end="00:05:51.669" style="s2">really want to clean and get up and like</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.910" end="00:05:54.310" style="s2">do the dishes because I put in more of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.669" end="00:05:55.750" style="s2">an effort than the men do but less than</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.310" end="00:05:57.849" style="s2">the most of the women and so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.750" end="00:05:59.320" style="s2">inadequate as a woman and that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.849" end="00:06:01.210" style="s2">are not as a woman and like not my</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.320" end="00:06:02.710" style="s2">womanliness but like just that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.210" end="00:06:05.349" style="s2">contributing enough that they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.710" end="00:06:06.550" style="s2">think that I&#39;m I&#39;m lazy cuz of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.349" end="00:06:08.110" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna judge me based on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.550" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">that I&#39;m a woman instead of the fact</p>
