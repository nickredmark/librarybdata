<p begin="00:00:00.660" end="00:00:02.660" style="s2">So, how are we going to do this?</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.660" end="00:00:04.100" style="s2">Are people just going to ask?</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.920" end="00:00:06.080" style="s2">All right.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:09.140" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.020" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">&quot;You have said that speech brings order out of chaos&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.380" end="00:00:19.840" style="s2">&quot;That&#39;s why free speech is important&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.040" end="00:00:24.520" style="s2">&quot;But why does it appear that speech brings chaos out of order?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:27.360" style="s2">So you would ask that.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.360" end="00:00:28.400" style="s2">The question is...</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.720" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">*laughter*</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.440" end="00:00:34.960" style="s2">The question is:  Speech brings order out of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.960" end="00:00:36.520" style="s2">--That&#39;s what I said--</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:40.720" style="s2">but it appears that speech brings chaos out of order as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">and the answer to that is- it does.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.560" end="00:00:47.880" style="s2">There is only so many complications I can address in the talk simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.240" end="00:00:50.240" style="s2">umm.... if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.240" end="00:00:53.320" style="s2">If you look at the most archaic of archetypal heroes</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.320" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">Those heroes confront something <br />that represents chaos</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">It&#39;s usually a monster that bears a treasure of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:05.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s a symbolic representation of the class of all unexplored things</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.440" end="00:01:09.160" style="s2">because things that we have not yet explored are threatening and destructive</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.160" end="00:01:11.600" style="s2">but also offer us infinite potential</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.080" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">but more elaborated hero stories, lets say</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:20.080" style="s2">also reverse that and say that- well there are times when the order has become so corrupt and rigid</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">that free speech fragments it into its parts</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:24.440" style="s2">so that it can rejuvenate itself</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:25.460" style="s2">and so...</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.160" end="00:01:27.640" style="s2">actually in the gospels</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.640" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the hero that Christ is basically represented as</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.440" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">He&#39;s not so much the dragon confronting...the dragon slayer who gathers the treasure</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:41.920" style="s2">Although that&#39;s implicit in the juxtaposition of Christ with the figure of like a serpentile satan</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:45.760" style="s2">but Christ is the thing that stands <br />up against the corrupt state</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.760" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">and rejuvenates it through speech</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">And so technically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">free speech- the logos is the thing that mediates between chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:01:56.360" style="s2">and you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.600" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">this is represented in many cultures- this idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:03.680" style="s2">You can see it most specifically in the Taoist conceptualisation</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:09.640" style="s2">because in the Taoist world, being is made out of chaos and order, yin and yang, masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.120" end="00:02:12.200" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.200" end="00:02:16.120" style="s2">and order is the fact that wherever you go, there are things you understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.120" end="00:02:20.040" style="s2">and chaos is- the fact that wherever you go, there are things that you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.040" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">And so the idea is that being is made out of the things that you understand and the things that you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:27.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s always that way</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">which is why Tao is the symbol of being per se</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:32.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.200" end="00:02:33.720" style="s2">Your brain is adapted in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.720" end="00:02:36.020" style="s2">it&#39;s partly why it has two hemispheres--</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.020" end="00:02:38.960" style="s2">for the world that you understand, and the world you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.960" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">the world you understand, roughly speaking, being handled by the left</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:46.040" style="s2">the world you don&#39;t understand, roughly speaking, being handled by the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:51.820" style="s2">Well it&#39;s that line down the middle that&#39;s Tao.  That&#39;s meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:56.280" style="s2">And if you have one foot in chaos and one foot in order, you&#39;re maximising information flow</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.280" end="00:02:59.760" style="s2">and rejuvenating yourself at the same time that you&#39;re maintaining your structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.200" end="00:03:04.600" style="s2">and you will report on that internally as engagement in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.080" end="00:03:07.700" style="s2">It&#39;s the most fundamental orienting sense that you have.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.700" end="00:03:10.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s deeply instantiated neurologically--</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.500" end="00:03:12.280" style="s2">unbelievably deeply.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.360" end="00:03:13.960" style="s2">And so it really is the case</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.960" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">that reality is chaos and order.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.280" end="00:03:20.520" style="s2">It&#39;s that to which you&#39;re adapted.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.520" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">And so sometimes you are speaking on behalf of chaos,</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:25.320" style="s2">and sometimes you are speaking on behalf of order.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.600" end="00:03:27.660" style="s2">It&#39;s more complicated than that too, though, because...</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.700" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">when we have a dialogue, say,</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.100" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">and we&#39;re mutually attempting <br />to climb towards the truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:36.280" style="s2">instead of convincing each other that we&#39;re right...</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.960" end="00:03:43.700" style="s2">then what we are doing is engaging in the simultaneous fragmentation of old and archaic belief systems,</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.700" end="00:03:46.540" style="s2">and they&#39;re updated.<br />And you can experience that--</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.540" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">because someone will say <br />something that sets you back</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:52.120" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll get what they&#39;re saying,<br /> and it will CLICK together.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:03:57.400" style="s2">And what you are experiencing is the death of an old conceptualisation structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.480" end="00:04:02.920" style="s2">(its disintegration), and then its <br />re-configuration in a tighter order.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:05.080" style="s2">And people love that.  They live for that.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.080" end="00:04:08.140" style="s2">It&#39;s--  Really, it&#39;s what keeps you ALIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.140" end="00:04:10.420" style="s2">And you can experience that in a deep conversation,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.420" end="00:04:14.280" style="s2">a truthful conversation,<br />a meeting of the minds and soul.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:18.640" style="s2">And people love that.  It&#39;s curative.<br />All psychotherapists know this.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.640" end="00:04:25.480" style="s2">Because, what you do in psychotherapy, in addition to helping people face the things that they&#39;re most afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.480" end="00:04:27.920" style="s2">so that they can overcome them</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.960" end="00:04:30.680" style="s2">is to allow them to tell someone the truth.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">&quot;What happened to you?  I&#39;ll listen...&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.040" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">So they tell you.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">And they take themselves apart, and <br />put themselves together,</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:40.980" style="s2">while they&#39;re speaking the truth about what happened.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:43.420" style="s2">And it puts them together.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">The two fundamental elements of psychotherapy are...</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">Let&#39;s find what you&#39;re afraid of and avoiding,</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:50.980" style="s2">and help you confront it,</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.980" end="00:04:53.920" style="s2">so that you can gather the information that&#39;s there...</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.480" end="00:04:59.640" style="s2">And...  Let&#39;s allow you to lay your story out in all of its catastrophe and detail</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.640" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">so that you can straighten yourself out through speech.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:04.900" style="s2">It&#39;s exactly what happens in psychotherapy.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.020" end="00:05:08.300" style="s2">And it should happen in every real relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.300" end="00:05:11.720" style="s2">It&#39;s the spiritual purpose of a marriage, fundamentally, right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.720" end="00:05:15.200" style="s2">Because you face someone who&#39;s different than you, that you&#39;re tied to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.200" end="00:05:17.760" style="s2">--and cannot run from--and so...<br />**laughter**</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.760" end="00:05:20.980" style="s2">you can reveal yourself...<br />Really, really...  It&#39;s a critical--</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.980" end="00:05:24.100" style="s2">It&#39;s a critical part of marriage.  Because if you can run,</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.100" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">from someone they will never show you their true face.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:31.300" style="s2">Because if someone shows you their TRUE face... you WILL run.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.580" end="00:05:38.140" style="s2">And so you say in a marriage ceremony, &quot;I will allow you to show me your true face, and I will not run.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.880" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">And unless you mean that, you&#39;ll never be married.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:46.120" style="s2">You&#39;ll never understand what it means.  And you&#39;ll never reap the benefits of it,</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.120" end="00:05:50.420" style="s2">which are practical, obviously, but also spiritual and psychological.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.060" end="00:05:54.340" style="s2">There&#39;s a reason for the vow, but it HAS to be a vow.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.340" end="00:05:59.140" style="s2">&#39;Cause otherwise you have a back door open, and you&#39;ll never really tell the person what you&#39;re like.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.140" end="00:06:01.580" style="s2">And, and no bloody wonder, because really...</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.580" end="00:06:03.620" style="s2">who really wants to know what you&#39;re like?</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:07.200" style="s2">**laughter**<br />Not even you... that&#39;s for sure.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.420" end="00:06:12.340" style="s2">So, I&#39;m not surprised for...</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.340" end="00:06:15.940" style="s2">I want to thank you, because what was surprising about your lecture today</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.940" end="00:06:19.860" style="s2">was this concept of altruism.  I think you were able to put everything together</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.860" end="00:06:23.020" style="s2">and at the end come out with a higher value of altruism.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.720" end="00:06:27.080" style="s2">And, to me it was a surprise, you know &lt;inaudible&gt;.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.080" end="00:06:30.920" style="s2">And I have a relationship with altruism, and the one that I find that&#39;s difficult for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.920" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">is that there&#39;s an evolutionary process of my brain--</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s an organ, it&#39;s developed, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">And I&#39;m amazed at how often I think of 3 people: me, myself and I.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.840" end="00:06:49.640" style="s2">To the point where I&#39;ve actually written down--counted--all the iterations of &quot;me, myself, and I&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.640" end="00:06:52.340" style="s2">in either my thoughts or my speech or even in someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.340" end="00:06:53.700" style="s2">And you&#39;ll get a PAGE...</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.700" end="00:06:55.640" style="s2">And sometimes we&#39;ll think of &quot;we&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.640" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">And as far as I&#39;ve been able to ascertain, it&#39;s because I have to expend energy</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.260" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">to think about someone else.</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.320" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">And yet,</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.500" end="00:07:07.580" style="s2">I&#39;m adicted to ease and comfort</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.580" end="00:07:09.820" style="s2">because my natural evolution is one of ease and comfort.</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.820" end="00:07:14.300" style="s2">You hear it in Alcoholic&#39;s Anonymous, &quot;Well, booze ain&#39;t the problem.  You&#39;re addicted to ease and comfort.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.100" end="00:07:17.980" style="s2">How do I overcome my--</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.020" end="00:07:22.060" style="s2">what I think is my sense of ease and comfort</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.100" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">to be able to make altruism a <br />more natural state of being?</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.420" end="00:07:29.080" style="s2">Jordan:  Good, good-- Good question.</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">So, the question is-- the first was a comment about</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.320" end="00:07:37.040" style="s2">the emphasis in my talk today on altruism</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.040" end="00:07:43.500" style="s2">and the second is, &quot;How do I--how do people overcome their proclivity to only act on their own behalf?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.640" end="00:07:46.440" style="s2">OK, so ... the first thing I will say is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.440" end="00:07:51.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe that what I spoke about today was in favor of altruism</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.020" end="00:07:55.540" style="s2">And, that&#39;s not a negative comment on your question.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.720" end="00:08:01.640" style="s2">But there&#39;s ...   So here&#39;s a primary religious injunction:</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.640" end="00:08:05.480" style="s2">Treat the other person like you would like to be treated yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.980" end="00:08:08.940" style="s2">That does not mean &quot;be nice to other people&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.940" end="00:08:13.320" style="s2">It does not mean &quot;sacrifice yourself excessively for other people&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.780" end="00:08:18.780" style="s2">It means... Think about the other person as if they were YOU,</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.780" end="00:08:23.580" style="s2">and figure out how you can mutually interact to better both of you at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.580" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">You have to build yourself into the equation.</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:28.000" style="s2">It&#39;s an equation.</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.780" end="00:08:31.420" style="s2">It&#39;s not that others are more valuable,</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.420" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">it&#39;s that we&#39;re ALL valuable.  We&#39;re equally valuable.</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:35.900" style="s2">And then you think &quot;well, how do you remind yourself of that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.900" end="00:08:38.540" style="s2">And the answer to that is, through terror.</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.280" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">Because terror is the genuine motivator.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:42.660" style="s2">So they say--</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.820" end="00:08:45.780" style="s2">&quot;Fear of god is the beginning of all wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.780" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">Well, what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:50.460" style="s2">It means, first, that you don&#39;t get away with anything.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.460" end="00:08:54.180" style="s2">And it&#39;s really useful to know that, because if you really know that,</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.200" end="00:08:56.280" style="s2">you won&#39;t TRY to get away with--</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.280" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">well, you still will--because people are stupid--but,</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.840" style="s2">**laughter**<br />but at least it will mitigate the possibility.  So--</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.260" end="00:09:06.900" style="s2">Here, I&#39;ll tell you something that Jung said.  This is quite profound.</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.900" end="00:09:09.540" style="s2">And I think it&#39;s the right answer to this question.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:14.400" style="s2">Yung believed-- He was interested in the emergence of higher morality.</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.400" end="00:09:19.080" style="s2">--something the developmental psychologist Piaget was also interested in--</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.080" end="00:09:23.780" style="s2">Piaget thought... we started out as individuals, then we learned to play games with other people.</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.780" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">Kids--children--learned how to play games with other children, and that made them social.</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">So, our society is a game, it&#39;s a giant game.</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.480" end="00:09:34.680" style="s2">That we&#39;re all playing together, voluntarily.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.680" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">And so children will first learn how to play the game,</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:39.580" style="s2">and only later did they learn the rules of the game.</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.580" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">They learned how to play the game first, and then learned the rules--how to SPEAK the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:47.420" style="s2">And then at some point they realized that they were also creators of the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.960" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">And so that&#39;s ...</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:51.540" style="s2">... moral development...</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.260" end="00:09:57.540" style="s2">... on a continual-- or, not a continual... it&#39;s a fractured staircase upward.</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.020" end="00:09:59.780" style="s2">But Jung was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.780" end="00:10:02.580" style="s2">elements of moral action that were higher than that, so...</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:06.400" style="s2">he conceptualized it symbolically.  So imagine this--</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.400" end="00:10:09.820" style="s2">He did this in the last book he wrote, called &quot;Mysterium Coniunctionis&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.960" end="00:10:13.000" style="s2">So imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.000" end="00:10:17.620" style="s2">you exist so that your conceptual structures and your emotions are in uneasy relationship with one another.</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.620" end="00:10:20.760" style="s2">So you&#39;re kind of a house divided ... amongst yourself.</p>
