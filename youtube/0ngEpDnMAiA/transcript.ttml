<p begin="00:02:39.719" end="00:02:45.569" style="s2">basically a format of say 15 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.999" end="00:02:48.150" style="s2">of dialoguing about where I&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.569" end="00:02:51.650" style="s2">from and so what I&#39;m gonna share with</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.150" end="00:02:56.609" style="s2">you today is a basic overview of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.650" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">Tree of Knowledge system and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.609" end="00:03:03.989" style="s2">a tree of knowledge theory of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">knowledge in the 21st century so let me</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.989" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">talk to you a little bit about what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:09.209" style="s2">is and then I&#39;ll share it with you I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:10.760" style="s2">share my screen I&#39;ll give you a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.209" end="00:03:13.319" style="s2">bit of history so you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.760" end="00:03:16.409" style="s2">where my background is so he mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.319" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">that I&#39;m a psychologist in graduate</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.409" end="00:03:19.409" style="s2">school I&#39;m gonna give you a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">abbreviated version so we can get into</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.409" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">this but it is important to kind of know</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:26.579" style="s2">where the frameworks coming from in</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:27.750" style="s2">graduate school I&#39;m a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.579" end="00:03:29.780" style="s2">psychologist so I was learning the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.750" end="00:03:33.829" style="s2">various approaches to psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.780" end="00:03:37.439" style="s2">learning cognitive behavioral humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.829" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">psychodynamic approaches and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.439" end="00:03:44.549" style="s2">really fortunate to have therapy</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">instructors and scholars who understood</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.549" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">that when done with integrity each of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:53.909" style="s2">the major modern approaches have an</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">enormous lot to offer and they can lead</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.909" end="00:03:58.259" style="s2">to new insights and creativity in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:04:00.620" style="s2">therapy room and have a lot of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.259" end="00:04:03.509" style="s2">to support them and yet at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.620" end="00:04:05.549" style="s2">there is essentially a problem of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.509" end="00:04:09.349" style="s2">psychotherapy that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.549" end="00:04:12.659" style="s2">different paradigms but no consensus and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.349" end="00:04:15.329" style="s2">when you take the key insights from them</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.659" end="00:04:17.159" style="s2">there is no backdrop of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.329" end="00:04:20.250" style="s2">that allows you to weave those key</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.159" end="00:04:21.599" style="s2">insights together so essentially you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.250" end="00:04:23.219" style="s2">given the option as to whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.599" end="00:04:25.699" style="s2">you&#39;re going to become a single school</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.219" end="00:04:27.990" style="s2">practitioner so I&#39;m gonna go straight</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.699" end="00:04:31.699" style="s2">psychodynamic and a Freudian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.990" end="00:04:33.419" style="s2">or cognitive or you become eclectic</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.699" end="00:04:36.050" style="s2">eclectic means okay I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.419" end="00:04:39.300" style="s2">borrow and make it my own</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.050" end="00:04:41.630" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not for a for</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.300" end="00:04:44.090" style="s2">somebody and I&#39;ll just speak you know my</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.630" end="00:04:45.980" style="s2">selves I really really emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.090" end="00:04:49.370" style="s2">coherence that&#39;s what my from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.980" end="00:04:51.350" style="s2">big-picture view so the Stephen Jay</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.370" end="00:04:54.140" style="s2">Gould talked about hedgehogs and foxes</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.350" end="00:04:56.180" style="s2">I&#39;m a big-picture hedgehog guy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.140" end="00:04:58.670" style="s2">looking for one big system often that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.180" end="00:05:00.380" style="s2">where my intuition takes me so all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.670" end="00:05:02.810" style="s2">these different systems with all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.380" end="00:05:04.250" style="s2">different language is bugged me I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.810" end="00:05:07.220" style="s2">learned about what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.250" end="00:05:08.600" style="s2">psychotherapy integration movement there</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.220" end="00:05:10.100" style="s2">is an actual movement inside of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.600" end="00:05:12.380" style="s2">psychotherapy where people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.100" end="00:05:14.230" style="s2">systematically exploring ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.380" end="00:05:17.720" style="s2">the various paradigms might go together</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.230" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">so there&#39;s a society about 500 people</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.720" end="00:05:23.480" style="s2">they have annual meetings and it&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:26.270" style="s2">very mainstream I actually took a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.480" end="00:05:27.710" style="s2">different approach than most of them in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.270" end="00:05:31.220" style="s2">thinking about this problem with</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.710" end="00:05:33.500" style="s2">psychotherapy and I&#39;ll ask you to take a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.220" end="00:05:35.480" style="s2">second and think about medicine for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.500" end="00:05:38.920" style="s2">second in the modern Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.480" end="00:05:41.660" style="s2">of medicine okay our modern Western</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.920" end="00:05:44.780" style="s2">approaches to medicine are reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.660" end="00:05:46.730" style="s2">well unified okay there are definitely</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.780" end="00:05:48.620" style="s2">different approaches and there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.730" end="00:05:50.870" style="s2">alternative medicines especially if we</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.620" end="00:05:53.240" style="s2">go to the east and many individuals</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.870" end="00:05:54.650" style="s2">question rightfully so in many regards</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.240" end="00:05:56.900" style="s2">whether or not the institution of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.650" end="00:05:58.460" style="s2">medicine as its employed however if</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.900" end="00:06:00.320" style="s2">you&#39;re a physician and you go and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.460" end="00:06:02.600" style="s2">learn how to treat the body in a modern</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.320" end="00:06:04.100" style="s2">Western way you learn about all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.600" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">organ systems you learn about the cells</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.100" end="00:06:07.130" style="s2">you learn about the various approaches</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:09.110" style="s2">you become a general practitioner you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.130" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">could become a specialist but they are</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.110" end="00:06:16.190" style="s2">unified relative to our basic</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:17.900" style="s2">understanding of human biology okay what</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.190" end="00:06:20.420" style="s2">I mean by that is the human biology</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.900" end="00:06:22.640" style="s2">gives you a basic science it&#39;s grounded</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.420" end="00:06:24.980" style="s2">in biology in general science of life</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.640" end="00:06:27.110" style="s2">and that provides us a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.980" end="00:06:29.870" style="s2">understanding natural selection genetics</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.110" end="00:06:33.350" style="s2">and physiology starting with cells and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.870" end="00:06:34.910" style="s2">how they build organisms and then that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.350" end="00:06:37.910" style="s2">gives rise to a picture of the human</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.280" end="00:06:51.320" style="s2">sets the stage for understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.410" end="00:06:54.440" style="s2">they go wrong and then how they might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.320" end="00:06:55.340" style="s2">fixed and modern medicine can be thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.440" end="00:06:58.670" style="s2">of as many</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.340" end="00:07:01.460" style="s2">since the pathophysiology analysis but</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.670" end="00:07:03.950" style="s2">it&#39;s relatively unified so that actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.460" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">gives rise to an idea if you jump up a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.950" end="00:07:07.600" style="s2">level if you have all these different</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:12.380" style="s2">psycho therapies wouldn&#39;t it make sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.600" end="00:07:16.430" style="s2">that these therapies might be unified by</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.380" end="00:07:18.530" style="s2">the science of human psychology so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.430" end="00:07:20.600" style="s2">in the mid 1990s here in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.530" end="00:07:23.020" style="s2">timeframe and basically I asked that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.600" end="00:07:25.640" style="s2">question I said to thyself hey</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.020" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">why wouldn&#39;t we have all the different</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.640" end="00:07:30.290" style="s2">psychotherapies be grounded and attached</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:34.760" style="s2">to a unified conception of human</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.290" end="00:07:36.680" style="s2">psychology okay and in in addressing</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.760" end="00:07:39.170" style="s2">that question I essentially discovered</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.680" end="00:07:40.790" style="s2">something which I already knew but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.170" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">looked at it in a very new light and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.790" end="00:07:45.740" style="s2">that was I already knew it but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:49.750" style="s2">appreciate it and that is there is no</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.740" end="00:07:53.060" style="s2">unified approach to psychology okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.750" end="00:07:54.950" style="s2">there simply isn&#39;t but now I actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.060" end="00:07:57.260" style="s2">had this question fundamentally in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.950" end="00:07:59.570" style="s2">different way I learned like virtually</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.260" end="00:08:01.610" style="s2">everybody if you go into you take a</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.570" end="00:08:03.530" style="s2">psych 101 course right now they&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.610" end="00:08:05.750" style="s2">you they&#39;ll say psychology is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.530" end="00:08:09.040" style="s2">science of behavior and mental process</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.750" end="00:08:11.420" style="s2">and the key word in that is science</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.040" end="00:08:13.610" style="s2">psychology fundamentally is about</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.420" end="00:08:15.830" style="s2">science is about asking empirical</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.610" end="00:08:19.010" style="s2">questions engaged in observation</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.830" end="00:08:21.700" style="s2">measurement construct validity analysis</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.010" end="00:08:24.230" style="s2">of variables causal experimentation and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.700" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">it is through that that we gain</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.230" end="00:08:29.060" style="s2">understanding as opposed to say folk</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:31.460" style="s2">psychology or save anthropology&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.060" end="00:08:33.290" style="s2">ethnographic approaches or any other</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.460" end="00:08:34.700" style="s2">number of different contrasts we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.290" end="00:08:37.370" style="s2">going to engage in behavioral science</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.700" end="00:08:40.220" style="s2">methodology to understand what it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.370" end="00:08:41.330" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to understand but if</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.220" end="00:08:42.530" style="s2">you flip that around you ask the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.330" end="00:08:45.560" style="s2">question what is it that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.530" end="00:08:48.140" style="s2">trying to understand and utilize the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.560" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">descriptions behavior and mental process</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.140" end="00:08:52.250" style="s2">and you look into the question about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:53.810" style="s2">ways in which people define those terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.250" end="00:08:56.390" style="s2">that&#39;s when you realize what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.810" end="00:08:58.280" style="s2">discovered and what is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.390" end="00:09:00.380" style="s2">well-known if you look for it is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.280" end="00:09:02.810" style="s2">what I call the problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.380" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">and that is the terms behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.810" end="00:09:09.410" style="s2">mental process these mean very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:10.910" style="s2">different things to in to people</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.410" end="00:09:13.309" style="s2">different paradigms to different bought</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.910" end="00:09:16.609" style="s2">processes in other words there is no</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.309" end="00:09:19.989" style="s2">consensus about what behavior and mental</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.609" end="00:09:22.729" style="s2">processes actually refer to in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.989" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">instead what you have is a wide variety</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.729" end="00:09:27.949" style="s2">of different paradigms models and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:29.989" style="s2">language systems that construe the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.949" end="00:09:32.839" style="s2">to define those terms in particular ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.989" end="00:09:35.269" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you get when you get to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.839" end="00:09:38.059" style="s2">psychology which is you get a discipline</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.269" end="00:09:40.189" style="s2">that is both pretty paradigmatic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.059" end="00:09:41.809" style="s2">it&#39;s not unified and then multi</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.189" end="00:09:44.299" style="s2">paradigmatic meaning that there are all</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.809" end="00:09:46.639" style="s2">these mid-level perspectives that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.299" end="00:09:48.169" style="s2">competing to provide a set of some</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.639" end="00:09:51.019" style="s2">understandings for behavior and mental</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.169" end="00:09:54.559" style="s2">processes that at some level commit to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.019" end="00:09:57.129" style="s2">the scientific methodology okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.559" end="00:09:59.629" style="s2">commitment is to scientific epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.129" end="00:10:02.059" style="s2">alright and the process by which you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.629" end="00:10:05.659" style="s2">measure and observe and try to delineate</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.059" end="00:10:07.929" style="s2">cause-and-effect but the topic the what</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.659" end="00:10:09.949" style="s2">I would call the ontological referent</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.929" end="00:10:11.389" style="s2">what it is that we&#39;re actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.949" end="00:10:14.179" style="s2">about in the world when we use the term</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.389" end="00:10:16.999" style="s2">behavior and mental processes is not</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.179" end="00:10:18.609" style="s2">defined at all instead what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.999" end="00:10:22.369" style="s2">a multiplicity of different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.609" end="00:10:25.069" style="s2">okay and that friends is what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.369" end="00:10:27.470" style="s2">the problem of psychology and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.069" end="00:10:30.529" style="s2">actually has been known basically ever</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.470" end="00:10:33.769" style="s2">since psychology was a discipline so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.529" end="00:10:36.220" style="s2">you go back to the original attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.769" end="00:10:38.600" style="s2">define the term psychology as a science</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.220" end="00:10:40.819" style="s2">that is we&#39;re gonna put it under the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.600" end="00:10:44.059" style="s2">modern scientific enterprise system</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.819" end="00:10:45.559" style="s2">ology alright then you go to vote and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.059" end="00:10:46.699" style="s2">you go to a whole bunch of other people</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.559" end="00:10:49.309" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to get into the history</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.699" end="00:10:51.619" style="s2">then you get behaviorism in America and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.309" end="00:10:54.049" style="s2">essentially what you have is a profound</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.619" end="00:10:57.079" style="s2">set of disagreements about what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.049" end="00:11:00.529" style="s2">define mind in relationship to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.079" end="00:11:03.379" style="s2">matter do so scientifically and no one</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.529" end="00:11:04.759" style="s2">and in 1920 one of the most perceptive</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.379" end="00:11:08.839" style="s2">psychologists that ever lived</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.759" end="00:11:10.759" style="s2">led guy Vygotsky called the field out on</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.839" end="00:11:13.129" style="s2">this and said hey we have a problem he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.759" end="00:11:13.989" style="s2">called it the crisis and every</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.129" end="00:11:16.099" style="s2">theoretical and philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.989" end="00:11:19.009" style="s2">psychologist ever since has acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.099" end="00:11:21.289" style="s2">that this is a crisis now the crisis got</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.009" end="00:11:22.390" style="s2">boring and so ultimately the field gave</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.289" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">it up and decided that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.390" end="00:11:27.400" style="s2">no solution to the crisis but it is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:29.650" style="s2">documented historical theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.400" end="00:11:31.690" style="s2">philosophical reality that this field</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.650" end="00:11:35.080" style="s2">has no consensus about what it actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.690" end="00:11:38.500" style="s2">refers to and so I share that with folks</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.080" end="00:11:41.260" style="s2">okay and I share the contrast with</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.500" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">biology now there people disagree of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.260" end="00:11:44.830" style="s2">course exactly what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.840" style="s2">constitutes life but the fact of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.830" end="00:11:49.210" style="s2">matter is is that virtually all believe</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.840" end="00:11:51.220" style="s2">and agree that biology science of life</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.210" end="00:11:52.930" style="s2">and they have a sense as to what life is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.220" end="00:11:55.510" style="s2">relative to not a bacterial cell is</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.930" end="00:11:57.820" style="s2">alive an atom is not you might debate</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.510" end="00:12:00.730" style="s2">about viruses but basically you can draw</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.820" end="00:12:03.250" style="s2">a picture around what life is so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.730" end="00:12:05.350" style="s2">fundamental problem of psychology okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.250" end="00:12:09.580" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I stumbled into in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.350" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">mid 1990s and over a course of a year a</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.580" end="00:12:14.530" style="s2">set of insights emerged that gave rise</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:16.680" style="s2">to what I think I think that I stumbled</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.530" end="00:12:20.230" style="s2">across a very very important problem and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.680" end="00:12:22.690" style="s2">ultimately I developed a system of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.230" end="00:12:26.410" style="s2">Tree of Knowledge system that sets the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.690" end="00:12:27.850" style="s2">stage for solving that problem so</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.410" end="00:12:29.620" style="s2">fundamentally I&#39;m interested in solving</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.850" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">the problem of psychology which</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.620" end="00:12:34.090" style="s2">basically means I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:40.270" style="s2">developing a science of behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.090" end="00:12:41.770" style="s2">mental processes coherently defined and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.270" end="00:12:42.220" style="s2">it turns out that that&#39;s a real hell of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.770" end="00:12:45.160" style="s2">a journey</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.220" end="00:12:46.690" style="s2">okay so what is my solution and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.160" end="00:12:49.270" style="s2">what I&#39;m here to share with you is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.690" end="00:12:50.830" style="s2">ultimately I backed up into a solution</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.270" end="00:12:52.510" style="s2">that I came to call the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.830" end="00:12:54.490" style="s2">knowledge and the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.510" end="00:12:58.390" style="s2">solution offers a new way to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.490" end="00:13:01.060" style="s2">universe and our scientific knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.390" end="00:13:03.400" style="s2">it what do I mean by a new way</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.060" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">well first off let me say it also offers</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.400" end="00:13:08.050" style="s2">an old way okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:10.750" style="s2">one of the oldest perennial philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.050" end="00:13:13.660" style="s2">is Aristotle&#39;s for you for example of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.750" end="00:13:15.190" style="s2">scale of nature okay where he argued</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.660" end="00:13:17.170" style="s2">that there are minerals and there are</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.540" end="00:20:30.050" style="s2">50 thousand years the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.170" end="00:20:33.140" style="s2">culture but defined in relationship to</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.730" end="00:20:45.650" style="s2">get a map of the ontic reality in the</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.650" end="00:20:49.190" style="s2">complexity but there are features to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:51.830" style="s2">that are very unique you get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.190" end="00:20:54.500" style="s2">distinction between the dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.830" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">complexity and you get away then to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.500" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">correspond those two distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:21:01.490" style="s2">between different domains of science the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:04.130" style="s2">argument is that that the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.490" end="00:21:06.770" style="s2">science Maps the ontic reality of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.130" end="00:21:09.860" style="s2">behavioral complexity and we can now</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">this suggests is that there&#39;s a way to</p>

<p begin="00:21:29.240" end="00:21:34.100" style="s2">emerges is a novel way to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.940" end="00:21:36.860" style="s2">problem of psychology which I can get</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.100" end="00:21:38.680" style="s2">into but the last piece I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.860" end="00:21:41.300" style="s2">before I then open this up to questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.680" end="00:21:43.730" style="s2">is for us to take a deep breath and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.300" end="00:21:47.150" style="s2">think seriously about this formulation</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.730" end="00:21:49.490" style="s2">and apply it to ourselves if we take it</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.150" end="00:21:52.690" style="s2">seriously what it means is we can see</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.490" end="00:21:55.880" style="s2">ourselves as physical material entities</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.690" end="00:21:59.270" style="s2">that have a weight have a mass of an</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.880" end="00:22:02.450" style="s2">atomic structure we can then see</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.270" end="00:22:04.670" style="s2">ourselves as physiological entities but</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.450" end="00:22:06.260" style="s2">have cellular structures that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.670" end="00:22:08.500" style="s2">communicating amongst themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.260" end="00:22:11.150" style="s2">forming networks of organs and organ</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.500" end="00:22:14.150" style="s2">system communication that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.150" end="00:22:16.810" style="s2">a physiological whole we can see</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.150" end="00:22:19.610" style="s2">ourselves as a neural mental entity</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.810" end="00:22:21.500" style="s2">whereby our phenomenological conscious</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.610" end="00:22:23.900" style="s2">experience somehow</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.500" end="00:22:25.880" style="s2">pulls together our whole brain activity</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.900" end="00:22:28.310" style="s2">gives us a perceptual experience and</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.880" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">that corresponds to our capacity also to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.310" end="00:22:34.310" style="s2">behave as whole entities and finally</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:37.850" style="s2">there&#39;s narration there&#39;s the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.310" end="00:22:40.040" style="s2">to self reflect and justify to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.850" end="00:22:42.860" style="s2">and to others what we are and to think</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.040" end="00:22:45.080" style="s2">about the rules and programs of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.860" end="00:22:48.140" style="s2">culture and decide what is acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.080" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">and what is not what that means is we</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.140" end="00:22:53.060" style="s2">can think about ourselves across the for</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:57.500" style="s2">quadratic layers of dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.060" end="00:22:59.510" style="s2">complexity and so I encourage us to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.500" end="00:23:01.700" style="s2">whether or not that correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.510" end="00:23:04.190" style="s2">allows us to sort the various behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.700" end="00:23:06.770" style="s2">frequencies that are commensurate with</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.190" end="00:23:08.060" style="s2">our perspective and the final piece what</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.770" end="00:23:10.670" style="s2">I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll try to bring us now</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.060" end="00:23:14.630" style="s2">collectively together I&#39;ll think about</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.670" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">where we are in history and invite us to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.630" end="00:23:19.610" style="s2">consider whether or not this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:21.560" style="s2">would continue is it the case then if it</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.610" end="00:23:23.450" style="s2">is the case that there are different</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.560" end="00:23:25.400" style="s2">information processing and communication</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.450" end="00:23:27.740" style="s2">systems that get networked together and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.400" end="00:23:30.380" style="s2">if there are novel ways of forming</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.740" end="00:23:32.630" style="s2">computation and these are the things the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.380" end="00:23:35.800" style="s2">ingredients that give rise to a complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.630" end="00:23:38.210" style="s2">adaptive plane of behavior a new</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.210" end="00:23:43.490" style="s2">emerges I think many of us certainly any</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.780" end="00:23:45.080" style="s2">people I talk to feel like we&#39;re on the</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.090" end="00:24:00.860" style="s2">it&#39;s as though things are happening so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">quickly and so differently that our old</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.860" end="00:24:04.520" style="s2">ways of being are being stripped and</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.980" end="00:24:17.270" style="s2">how do we understand that from this</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.050" end="00:24:19.010" style="s2">perspective well if we go to the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.270" end="00:24:21.170" style="s2">century and we take the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.010" end="00:24:23.810" style="s2">knowledge seriously what you see very</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.170" end="00:24:25.820" style="s2">clearly is that you would simply ask the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.810" end="00:24:28.430" style="s2">question has there been the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:30.890" style="s2">novel systems of information processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.430" end="00:24:32.900" style="s2">have they been networked together are</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.890" end="00:24:35.100" style="s2">they interfacing both with human</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.900" end="00:24:37.830" style="s2">intelligence and each other to create</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.100" end="00:24:39.480" style="s2">artificial intelligence set and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.830" end="00:24:42.929" style="s2">sudden you have a very clear picture</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.480" end="00:24:45.990" style="s2">that before us is the emergence of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.929" end="00:24:47.580" style="s2">meta cultural digital landscape and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.990" end="00:24:50.160" style="s2">believe fundamentally this is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.580" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">problem of the fifth joint point and one</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.160" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">of the ways to characterize ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:24:55.890" style="s2">and the time that we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:59.160" style="s2">is that we are actually in the process</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.890" end="00:25:00.929" style="s2">of a transition through the dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.160" end="00:25:02.429" style="s2">culture and justification which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.929" end="00:25:04.679" style="s2">becoming networked together now with</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.429" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">artificial intelligence and internet</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.679" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">structures that are giving rise to what</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:14.460" style="s2">Oliver Reiser of 1950 philosopher called</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.039" end="00:25:18.090" style="s2">the world sensorial and so with that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.460" end="00:25:20.220" style="s2">will pause and say here this is the map</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.090" end="00:25:22.200" style="s2">ultimately this provides a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.220" end="00:25:25.590" style="s2">understanding both what psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.200" end="00:25:28.650" style="s2">and I argue now in my latest book really</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.590" end="00:25:30.210" style="s2">this is a 21st century way to understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.650" end="00:25:33.690" style="s2">the physical biological psychological</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.210" end="00:25:38.370" style="s2">and social sciences so I will stop my</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.690" end="00:25:41.490" style="s2">sharing the screen for them see Nick if</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.370" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">we if you want a riff off of that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.490" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">then we can pop into Q&amp;A yeah I mean wow</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">so I remember the first time that Greg</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:53.280" style="s2">walked me through this and just blew my</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">mind and now you just did it again</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.280" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">for a whole frickin audience so this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:03.000" style="s2">so I mean obviously as we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">fifth joint point in going down that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.000" end="00:26:06.450" style="s2">rabbit hole of what that could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:08.600" style="s2">that&#39;s that feels really alive to me but</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.450" end="00:26:12.659" style="s2">before before we need to go there I</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.600" end="00:26:14.220" style="s2">wanted to ask about something that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.659" end="00:26:16.100" style="s2">Peter talks a lot about here on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.220" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">stoah is be in a right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.100" end="00:26:24.090" style="s2">right or you talked about coherence in</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:26.510" style="s2">the beginning of this talk and so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.090" end="00:26:28.740" style="s2">like your theory provides an</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.510" end="00:26:29.640" style="s2">intellectual way of understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.740" end="00:26:32.039" style="s2">it means to be in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.640" end="00:26:33.360" style="s2">with reality or with nature and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.039" end="00:26:35.970" style="s2">and then there&#39;s an embodied way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">course of doing that which is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.970" end="00:26:40.740" style="s2">what we&#39;re making psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">practices could be getting at so do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.740" end="00:26:45.600" style="s2">think that with you know meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:46.269" style="s2">journaling or whatever it whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.600" end="00:26:47.889" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.269" end="00:26:50.589" style="s2">these methods provide that&#39;s the way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.889" end="00:26:52.869" style="s2">getting us into personal harmony and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.589" end="00:26:55.779" style="s2">then if we do that at scale collectively</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.869" end="00:26:58.899" style="s2">we get collective harmony and you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.779" end="00:27:00.940" style="s2">we&#39;re able to create what-what Zach</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.899" end="00:27:04.989" style="s2">Stein calls a unique self Symphony right</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.940" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">so is that our way to even manage to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.989" end="00:27:11.709" style="s2">to that fifth joint point by doing these</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:15.309" style="s2">sets of practices well okay so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.709" end="00:27:17.589" style="s2">great set of questions let me see you</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.309" end="00:27:18.940" style="s2">know sort of respond to them so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.589" end="00:27:20.499" style="s2">just remind everybody that I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.940" end="00:27:22.959" style="s2">clinical psychologist and have been</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.499" end="00:27:26.109" style="s2">training clinical psychologists for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.959" end="00:27:29.459" style="s2">know since 2003 here at the James</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.109" end="00:27:32.109" style="s2">Madison University and that my concern</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.459" end="00:27:35.169" style="s2">fundamentally is with well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.109" end="00:27:35.799" style="s2">dignity and in doing and living with</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.169" end="00:27:37.839" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.799" end="00:27:39.940" style="s2">so I&#39;m fundamentally concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.839" end="00:27:42.669" style="s2">wisdom and what I just shared with you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.940" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">the scientific knowledge so I will offer</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.669" end="00:27:46.479" style="s2">the idea that after what what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:49.659" style="s2">sharing with you on this piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.479" end="00:27:52.959" style="s2">equation here it&#39;s a sense making system</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.659" end="00:27:55.839" style="s2">okay so that you can apply and put on</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.959" end="00:27:58.089" style="s2">your tree of knowledge goggles to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.839" end="00:28:00.609" style="s2">understand and organize an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.089" end="00:28:02.379" style="s2">amount of science the short story</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.609" end="00:28:04.179" style="s2">basically is that the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.379" end="00:28:06.099" style="s2">Enterprise the modernist scientific</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.179" end="00:28:08.919" style="s2">enterprise set us up to have good</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.099" end="00:28:10.950" style="s2">glasses frames of reference and ways of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.919" end="00:28:14.349" style="s2">understanding the material and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.950" end="00:28:16.539" style="s2">biological dimensions of complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.349" end="00:28:19.179" style="s2">although we&#39;ve made enormous progress on</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.539" end="00:28:22.989" style="s2">the mental and social cycle as science</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.179" end="00:28:25.239" style="s2">dimensions there remains huge chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.989" end="00:28:27.909" style="s2">that chaos is contributing to our</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.239" end="00:28:30.789" style="s2">inability to distill the information</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.909" end="00:28:32.769" style="s2">that the psychological social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.789" end="00:28:35.289" style="s2">have offered us and understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.769" end="00:28:37.570" style="s2">utilize them for practical benefit now</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.289" end="00:28:39.070" style="s2">why well ultimately that&#39;s what the tree</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.570" end="00:28:41.379" style="s2">of knowledge says as well because the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.070" end="00:28:43.539" style="s2">modernist Enterprise failed to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.379" end="00:28:45.089" style="s2">matter of mind relation and in</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.539" end="00:28:47.049" style="s2">particular didn&#39;t understand social</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.089" end="00:28:49.869" style="s2">justification versus scientific</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.049" end="00:28:51.759" style="s2">justification so what we need is a sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.869" end="00:28:54.369" style="s2">making system that puts psychology</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.759" end="00:28:56.499" style="s2">effectively on top of biology and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.369" end="00:29:00.039" style="s2">puts the social sciences effectively on</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.499" end="00:29:02.019" style="s2">top of that if we have a coherence</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.039" end="00:29:04.330" style="s2">making system for science writ large</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.019" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">well that&#39;s gonna help us and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.330" end="00:29:08.109" style="s2">desperately need it as everybody talks</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:10.539" style="s2">in the rebel wisdom crowd this crowd</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.109" end="00:29:12.129" style="s2">were in a sense making crisis and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.539" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">what the tree of knowledge fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.129" end="00:29:16.299" style="s2">is about is about a set of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">architectures that allows you to see now</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.299" end="00:29:19.929" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t tell you how to live this</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:21.729" style="s2">is a knowledge system not on wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.929" end="00:29:24.489" style="s2">system the system behind me the tree</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.729" end="00:29:26.679" style="s2">behind me it really represents really</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.489" end="00:29:28.570" style="s2">what&#39;s called the unified framework now</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.679" end="00:29:31.690" style="s2">embedded in the unified framework is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.570" end="00:29:35.590" style="s2">whole set of structures that have on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.690" end="00:29:38.710" style="s2">one hand are pure reason or scientific</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.590" end="00:29:40.659" style="s2">reason maps for sense making which also</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.710" end="00:29:42.519" style="s2">on the other hand have practical reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.659" end="00:29:44.139" style="s2">in fact the right side of the tree if</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.519" end="00:29:46.570" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at it here is the side of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.139" end="00:29:48.700" style="s2">practical reason the side of practical</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.570" end="00:29:52.659" style="s2">reason brings in things like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.700" end="00:29:55.509" style="s2">what is adaptive versus maladaptive how</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.659" end="00:29:57.849" style="s2">do we foster healthy development what</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.509" end="00:29:59.979" style="s2">fundamentally is human well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.849" end="00:30:02.529" style="s2">how do we achieve human wellbeing in</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.979" end="00:30:04.809" style="s2">relationship to ourselves relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.529" end="00:30:06.820" style="s2">to others and in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.809" end="00:30:08.229" style="s2">natural environment and the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.820" end="00:30:10.590" style="s2">digital environment those are</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.229" end="00:30:12.820" style="s2">foundational questions and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.590" end="00:30:16.619" style="s2">what are the principles and processes</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.820" end="00:30:19.690" style="s2">that we enact to foster the right psycho</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.619" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">technologies okay then enable the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.690" end="00:30:26.139" style="s2">ecology of practices to foster growth</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:27.460" style="s2">toward well-being I love what John for</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.139" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">Becky is doing in his in ecology</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.460" end="00:30:32.379" style="s2">practice I love his dialogue owes us</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:35.139" style="s2">that enables us to create inner</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.379" end="00:30:35.830" style="s2">subjective context so we can be curious</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.139" end="00:30:38.830" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.830" end="00:30:41.470" style="s2">accepting lobbying and also challenging</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.830" end="00:30:43.359" style="s2">as we move towards goals in fact my</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.470" end="00:30:46.450" style="s2">approach to mindfulness is called calm</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.359" end="00:30:48.070" style="s2">Emma okay and that actually is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.450" end="00:30:50.139" style="s2">acronym that calm is an acronym for</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.070" end="00:30:52.090" style="s2">curiosity acceptance loving compassion</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.139" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">and motivated to our valued states of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.090" end="00:30:56.200" style="s2">being in other words it brings in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:57.849" style="s2">kinds of psycho technologies that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.200" end="00:31:00.340" style="s2">believe are conducive to healthy social</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.849" end="00:31:02.499" style="s2">emotional processes and fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.340" end="00:31:04.929" style="s2">then to get to your question it starts</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.499" end="00:31:08.499" style="s2">to set the stage for giving us guidance</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.929" end="00:31:10.059" style="s2">for how we ought to live now it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.499" end="00:31:12.279" style="s2">tell you what to do that anyone that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.059" end="00:31:13.570" style="s2">tell you recipe wise I think would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.279" end="00:31:15.250" style="s2">naive and you should run away</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.570" end="00:31:18.670" style="s2">but it gives you guideposts and</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.250" end="00:31:20.380" style="s2">principles and reflections on the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.670" end="00:31:22.540" style="s2">of values that we should use to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.380" end="00:31:31.870" style="s2">structure what it is that we might be</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.540" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">doing so that that was a good answer</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.870" end="00:31:37.060" style="s2">yeah to say the least</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:39.640" style="s2">so okay now now we&#39;re getting questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.060" end="00:31:42.730" style="s2">coming in but but Peter had the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.640" end="00:31:44.160" style="s2">question so I&#39;ll give it to Peter cool</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.730" end="00:31:47.610" style="s2">thanks Nick</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.160" end="00:31:50.050" style="s2">so my question is about psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.610" end="00:31:52.150" style="s2">and I know that&#39;s sort of where you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.050" end="00:31:53.830" style="s2">started in your career and I geeked out</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.150" end="00:31:56.380" style="s2">about all sorts of cyclic therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.830" end="00:31:58.290" style="s2">modalities like over hundreds acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.380" end="00:32:01.980" style="s2">commitment therapy Gestalt focusing</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.290" end="00:32:04.270" style="s2">transactional analysis whatever and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.980" end="00:32:05.800" style="s2">burst in a lot of them and I learned</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.270" end="00:32:07.860" style="s2">from a lot of them but they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.800" end="00:32:10.060" style="s2">interact with each other quite well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.860" end="00:32:11.800" style="s2">and so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.060" end="00:32:13.720" style="s2">important to have these like meta</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.800" end="00:32:16.390" style="s2">frameworks to kind of allow them to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.720" end="00:32:18.280" style="s2">hosts in but I&#39;m also curious about like</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.390" end="00:32:20.110" style="s2">a kind of a seductive way in order to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.280" end="00:32:21.250" style="s2">get them to interact and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.110" end="00:32:23.430" style="s2">thinking about having something like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.250" end="00:32:25.900" style="s2">psychotherapeutic cafe here will be like</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.430" end="00:32:27.520" style="s2">practitioners and they teach it and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.900" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">try to figure out how they can interact</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.520" end="00:32:33.310" style="s2">with each other to see what emerges when</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:34.630" style="s2">they interact so I&#39;m just curious if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.310" end="00:32:38.350" style="s2">have any thoughts on that and in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.630" end="00:32:41.410" style="s2">approach well first off I&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.350" end="00:32:43.300" style="s2">wonderful stoah approach you know the I</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.410" end="00:32:45.520" style="s2">Wilson I will say there&#39;s now a long</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.300" end="00:32:48.990" style="s2">history of exactly what you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.520" end="00:32:52.600" style="s2">suggesting that&#39;s called the formal</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.990" end="00:32:53.980" style="s2">academic home for people that have been</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.600" end="00:32:57.220" style="s2">wrestling with this which has been</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.980" end="00:32:59.350" style="s2">started since 1983 is the Society for</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.220" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">the exploration of psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.350" end="00:33:04.150" style="s2">integration set okay and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:07.240" style="s2">literally professionals coming together</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:09.280" style="s2">with notice the framing it&#39;s a Society</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.240" end="00:33:11.260" style="s2">for the exploration of psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.280" end="00:33:12.250" style="s2">integration so it is literally a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.260" end="00:33:13.870" style="s2">metaframe</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.250" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">that brings individuals together</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.870" end="00:33:19.000" style="s2">precisely along the lines where you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:20.680" style="s2">sophisticated dialogue and exchange from</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.000" end="00:33:22.570" style="s2">various perspectives and then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.680" end="00:33:23.980" style="s2">explore the processes by which you might</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.570" end="00:33:26.760" style="s2">riff off of each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.980" end="00:33:29.250" style="s2">blend them develop ways of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.760" end="00:33:30.870" style="s2">benefitting and exploring so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.250" end="00:33:32.760" style="s2">been going on for a long time in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.870" end="00:33:35.390" style="s2">was socialized to that I love that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.760" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">learned an enormous amount from it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.390" end="00:33:40.710" style="s2">and really I&#39;ve been really in addition</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:42.540" style="s2">you know half my challenge was on this</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.710" end="00:33:44.610" style="s2">what&#39;s the problem of psychology the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.540" end="00:33:48.120" style="s2">other half is what is psychotherapy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.610" end="00:33:50.490" style="s2">how do you manage this dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.120" end="00:33:51.960" style="s2">tension between unity on the one hand so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.490" end="00:33:54.600" style="s2">we actually have consensus is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.960" end="00:33:58.160" style="s2">talking about and at the same time I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.600" end="00:34:00.360" style="s2">complete anti-authoritarian I hate sorry</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.160" end="00:34:02.940" style="s2">language wise okay so it&#39;s look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.360" end="00:34:04.710" style="s2">like you know III I do not want a script</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.940" end="00:34:06.750" style="s2">and I do not want somebody tell me what</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.710" end="00:34:08.940" style="s2">to do that&#39;s gonna crush my soul all</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.750" end="00:34:11.429" style="s2">right so how do we actually get</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.940" end="00:34:13.590" style="s2">coherence with without scripting and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.429" end="00:34:15.450" style="s2">dominating and asserting that my way is</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.590" end="00:34:17.639" style="s2">better than yours allow individuals</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.450" end="00:34:20.250" style="s2">their own exploration and their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.639" end="00:34:22.980" style="s2">capacity to use John for babies term to</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.929" end="00:34:43.470" style="s2">round of conversations about what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.879" end="00:34:45.990" style="s2">mindfulness is the various elements</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.470" end="00:34:48.060" style="s2">associated with it so I could go on and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.990" end="00:34:49.859" style="s2">on about that but I&#39;ll simply I&#39;ll pause</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:05.670" style="s2">years that I directed a combined</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.670" end="00:35:10.230" style="s2">taught an integrative psychotherapy uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.350" end="00:35:13.160" style="s2">navigated this is my that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.230" end="00:35:18.840" style="s2">professional wheelhouse and life so</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.160" end="00:35:21.060" style="s2">summarize thank you yeah awesome and as</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.840" end="00:35:24.980" style="s2">a good follow-up that builds on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.060" end="00:35:24.980" style="s2">Edward did you ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:41.450" style="s2">this is something that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.260" end="00:35:47.990" style="s2">discussing a lot recently in federal</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.450" end="00:35:51.980" style="s2">circles is this tree of knowledge since</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.990" end="00:35:56.950" style="s2">making system is helpful for perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.980" end="00:36:01.550" style="s2">most practitioners trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.950" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">and contextualize the various branches</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.550" end="00:36:08.990" style="s2">of knowledge as a practicing</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:11.150" style="s2">psychotherapist you see it would seem</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.990" end="00:36:15.140" style="s2">counterproductive to just start talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.150" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">about these kinds of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.140" end="00:36:23.240" style="s2">systems to clients who are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">very personal problems so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.240" end="00:36:32.869" style="s2">translate this down into treating a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:35.510" style="s2">patient where they are to make their</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.869" end="00:36:37.660" style="s2">life happier and healthier without</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.510" end="00:36:40.040" style="s2">feeding them a bunch of theory that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.660" end="00:36:40.460" style="s2">comes over their head might turn them</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.040" end="00:36:44.810" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.460" end="00:36:48.589" style="s2">of course yes so I want to be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.810" end="00:36:49.790" style="s2">my approach to you know psychotherapy is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.589" end="00:36:52.730" style="s2">not to start with the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.790" end="00:36:54.020" style="s2">by any stretch my approach to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.730" end="00:36:56.060" style="s2">psychotherapy is to start with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.020" end="00:36:57.500" style="s2">indigenous real relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.060" end="00:36:59.630" style="s2">understand what the presenting problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.500" end="00:37:02.060" style="s2">is the person in front of me and to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.630" end="00:37:04.339" style="s2">communicate both directly and indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.060" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">to the extent that&#39;s appropriate that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.339" end="00:37:10.069" style="s2">in care and and deeply interested in who</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:12.829" style="s2">they are and convey relational value and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.069" end="00:37:15.050" style="s2">establish an opportunity perhaps where</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.829" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">if if appropriate given the presenting</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.050" end="00:37:18.770" style="s2">problem in my expertise I might be able</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:20.150" style="s2">to help them okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.770" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">so the first thing that you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.150" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">it from a psychotherapeutic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:28.339" style="s2">is you want to create a healing context</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:30.200" style="s2">now I have a systematic approach by</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.339" end="00:37:33.140" style="s2">which then I will assess psychosocial</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.200" end="00:37:36.440" style="s2">functioning we didn&#39;t talk about it that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.140" end="00:37:38.119" style="s2">much but on the first the fifth branch</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.440" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">of the tree which is actually the first</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.119" end="00:37:43.220" style="s2">one that&#39;s under psychotherapy the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.200" end="00:37:46.369" style="s2">psychotherapy side is</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.220" end="00:37:48.650" style="s2">character adaptation systems theory okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.369" end="00:37:52.190" style="s2">character adaptation systems theory then</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.650" end="00:37:56.570" style="s2">translates the theory side of the tree</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.190" end="00:37:59.000" style="s2">to an applied model of how people adapt</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.570" end="00:38:00.590" style="s2">to the environment and it argues that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.000" end="00:38:03.530" style="s2">actually there are different systems of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.590" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">mental adaptation I&#39;ll just list the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.530" end="00:38:09.380" style="s2">standard meaning words that we use</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:10.849" style="s2">there&#39;s a habit system okay it&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.380" end="00:38:12.859" style="s2">base level you for where you form</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.849" end="00:38:14.210" style="s2">procedural habits that are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.859" end="00:38:15.740" style="s2">operate automatically outside</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.210" end="00:38:18.290" style="s2">consciousness they&#39;re triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.740" end="00:38:21.050" style="s2">stimuli they have contingency codes</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.290" end="00:38:23.150" style="s2">essentially that you enact then you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.050" end="00:38:24.590" style="s2">an experiential system this is what Carl</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.150" end="00:38:27.260" style="s2">Rogers was deeply concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.590" end="00:38:29.780" style="s2">organized by your core emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.260" end="00:38:32.630" style="s2">perception but really sits in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.780" end="00:38:36.290" style="s2">and tracks your sense of relational your</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.630" end="00:38:38.450" style="s2">values effectively you also have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.290" end="00:38:40.970" style="s2">relationship system your real attachment</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.450" end="00:38:43.670" style="s2">system which is how you place yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.970" end="00:38:45.619" style="s2">in relationship to others intuitively in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.670" end="00:38:47.180" style="s2">terms of your working models relative to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.619" end="00:38:50.300" style="s2">your history like your attachment system</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.180" end="00:38:51.619" style="s2">do you have a clear strong robust secure</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.300" end="00:38:53.720" style="s2">attachment system or do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.619" end="00:38:56.920" style="s2">disorganized and vulnerable attachment</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.720" end="00:38:59.690" style="s2">system this this creates basically your</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.920" end="00:39:01.820" style="s2">phenomenological architecture okay on</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.690" end="00:39:04.460" style="s2">top of that you have your self conscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.820" end="00:39:05.960" style="s2">justifying system all right so if I ask</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.460" end="00:39:08.030" style="s2">somebody hey what brings you in today</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.960" end="00:39:10.490" style="s2">what I am getting is their public</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.030" end="00:39:12.619" style="s2">narrative that describes what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.490" end="00:39:13.940" style="s2">they are that how they justify who they</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.619" end="00:39:17.240" style="s2">are what&#39;s happened to them and what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.940" end="00:39:19.460" style="s2">problem is okay and then between their</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.240" end="00:39:20.690" style="s2">self conscious justifier and all what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.460" end="00:39:23.869" style="s2">talked about from an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.690" end="00:39:25.190" style="s2">experience in relational position okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.869" end="00:39:26.839" style="s2">what you have are all the defenses</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.190" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">because they&#39;re trying to regulate how</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.839" end="00:39:29.810" style="s2">they actually feel how they think they</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">ought to feel and how they should feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.810" end="00:39:35.300" style="s2">to meet so what I do is I then take an</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:38.150" style="s2">opportunity I listen to their story I</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.300" end="00:39:40.280" style="s2">convey relational value and I listen to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.150" end="00:39:42.290" style="s2">the various themes about apt ation</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.280" end="00:39:43.940" style="s2">across their habits across their</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.290" end="00:39:46.220" style="s2">emotions across their relationships</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.940" end="00:39:48.109" style="s2">across their justifications to me into</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.220" end="00:39:49.730" style="s2">themselves and how they describe their</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.109" end="00:39:52.940" style="s2">interpersonal and developmental world</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.730" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s through that then that I enable an</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.940" end="00:39:56.410" style="s2">opportunity for that both of us to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:59.530" style="s2">perhaps to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.410" end="00:40:01.810" style="s2">a sense of awareness set the stage for</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.530" end="00:40:04.210" style="s2">accepting what we can&#39;t change and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.810" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">identifying possible adapted pathways</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.210" end="00:40:09.000" style="s2">that we could work on in therapy room</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:09.000" style="s2">that would enhance their well-being</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.770" end="00:40:14.770" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.760" end="00:40:18.130" style="s2">wow there&#39;s a lot of good questions in</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.770" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">the chat but key are on did you ask your</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.130" end="00:40:26.530" style="s2">question oh yeah don&#39;t know which or</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:27.940" style="s2">let&#39;s go this was the top one the idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.530" end="00:40:30.580" style="s2">of honestly taking the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.940" end="00:40:33.160" style="s2">perspectives and full emergence onto the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.580" end="00:40:35.980" style="s2">other side to what extent are ideas like</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.160" end="00:40:37.810" style="s2">a soul or a daemon merely analogies to</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.980" end="00:40:40.750" style="s2">guide us on the bleeding edge of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.810" end="00:40:44.020" style="s2">emerging complexity because of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.750" end="00:40:46.300" style="s2">for a sort of existed prior it suggests</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.020" end="00:40:48.850" style="s2">there was something prior but of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.300" end="00:40:50.860" style="s2">here emergence suggests things have been</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.850" end="00:40:52.780" style="s2">created as we go so I&#39;m just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.860" end="00:40:55.270" style="s2">what your opinion as opposed to pers</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.780" end="00:40:59.470" style="s2">yeah yeah so this is a great question</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.270" end="00:41:02.200" style="s2">and I&#39;ll tell you my primary focus is</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.470" end="00:41:05.260" style="s2">what I call on my metaphysical empirical</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.200" end="00:41:06.670" style="s2">system and what I mean by that is I the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.260" end="00:41:08.620" style="s2">Tree of Knowledge what I just show you I</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.670" end="00:41:11.530" style="s2">now characterize it as a descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.620" end="00:41:13.930" style="s2">metaphysical system for our naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.530" end="00:41:17.080" style="s2">scientific knowledge and that&#39;s where my</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.930" end="00:41:19.390" style="s2">focus is so so I am a naturalist in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.080" end="00:41:21.640" style="s2">regard and my focus is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.390" end="00:41:25.420" style="s2">understand the world through naturalism</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.640" end="00:41:27.640" style="s2">and I and and I start with energy in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.420" end="00:41:28.750" style="s2">physics concept of the word basically in</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.640" end="00:41:30.250" style="s2">the emergence of matter and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.750" end="00:41:32.430" style="s2">emergence of life the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.250" end="00:41:34.270" style="s2">nervous system mind and gotten</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.430" end="00:41:36.250" style="s2">phenomenological consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.270" end="00:41:37.960" style="s2">the emergence of self-awareness into</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.250" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">where we are here okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.960" end="00:41:43.720" style="s2">when I use the word soul I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:46.600" style="s2">using it although I am appreciating and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.720" end="00:41:48.370" style="s2">embracing that term because I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.600" end="00:41:50.980" style="s2">make a lot of jumps to at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.370" end="00:41:52.210" style="s2">metaphorical religious constructs but</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.980" end="00:41:55.060" style="s2">actually I can use it also in</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.210" end="00:41:56.590" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s meaning of the term which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.060" end="00:41:59.220" style="s2">actually the functional form of an</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.590" end="00:42:01.510" style="s2">individual&#39;s life you know starting with</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.220" end="00:42:04.390" style="s2">vegetative and then into animal and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.510" end="00:42:06.370" style="s2">into living a human rational life okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.390" end="00:42:08.920" style="s2">so my the functional form of my life</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.370" end="00:42:09.450" style="s2">especially from my perspective is a good</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.920" end="00:42:13.560" style="s2">word for</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.450" end="00:42:17.490" style="s2">psyche or soul all right now I am a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.560" end="00:42:20.130" style="s2">believer okay at multiple levels okay of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.490" end="00:42:23.609" style="s2">sort of our ultimate concern that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.130" end="00:42:25.470" style="s2">resides I offered a letter an open</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.609" end="00:42:27.150" style="s2">letter to humanity where I frame what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.470" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">called the elephant son God</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.150" end="00:42:32.910" style="s2">okay the elephant son God is my metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:35.670" style="s2">for our ultimate good concern okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.910" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">whether it&#39;s Aristotle&#39;s notion of you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.670" end="00:42:40.260" style="s2">die a monic the ultimate you die a monic</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:44.099" style="s2">endpoint or whether we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.260" end="00:42:47.430" style="s2">an Omega whether we&#39;re talking about ROI</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.430" end="00:42:52.920" style="s2">spiritual concepts that orient me toward</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:55.079" style="s2">the ultimate good so I definitely it</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.920" end="00:42:57.270" style="s2">would to say that yes I have a soul</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.079" end="00:42:59.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the function of my life and a key</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.270" end="00:43:01.170" style="s2">aspect of my soul is my ultimate concern</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.640" end="00:43:01.829" style="s2">that&#39;s my fundamental concerns with</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.170" end="00:43:04.619" style="s2">morality</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.829" end="00:43:07.320" style="s2">I love thing money like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.619" end="00:43:08.940" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s analysis okay of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.320" end="00:43:10.500" style="s2">and the idea that well we could think</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.940" end="00:43:12.210" style="s2">about heaven and hell in Supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.500" end="00:43:14.849" style="s2">terms or we can think about it actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.210" end="00:43:17.220" style="s2">on here and now terms okay so the Gulag</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.849" end="00:43:20.190" style="s2">Archipelago is the story about hell on</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.220" end="00:43:20.940" style="s2">earth right and and when you&#39;re in good</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.190" end="00:43:22.829" style="s2">shape</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.940" end="00:43:24.450" style="s2">and your well-being is being met and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.829" end="00:43:28.410" style="s2">that can be a story of heaven on earth</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.450" end="00:43:31.260" style="s2">alright so so how do i cultivate my soul</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.410" end="00:43:33.750" style="s2">toward my spirit and not become a demon</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.260" end="00:43:36.420" style="s2">here on earth so that&#39;s that&#39;s the way I</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.750" end="00:43:38.300" style="s2">would frame that and I am agnostic about</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.420" end="00:43:40.920" style="s2">what&#39;s outside of the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.300" end="00:43:43.710" style="s2">empirical edge that I am focused on and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.920" end="00:43:45.240" style="s2">you know God as I like to say god only</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.710" end="00:43:48.359" style="s2">knows what&#39;s on the other side of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.240" end="00:43:56.900" style="s2">and and embrace it if that&#39;s where your</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.359" end="00:44:01.910" style="s2">faith takes awesome and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.900" end="00:44:01.910" style="s2">Alex good oh did you ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.540" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">okay hey guys um I may have to break off</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.260" end="00:44:15.650" style="s2">because I have to give up my computer</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:18.330" style="s2">but I&#39;ll try and get it in um so I I</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.650" end="00:44:19.650" style="s2">came across the old knowledge earlier</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.330" end="00:44:23.250" style="s2">but this is really explained it</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.650" end="00:44:26.070" style="s2">beautifully I thank you so much um the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.250" end="00:44:28.350" style="s2">my I reacted though when he was starting</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.070" end="00:44:30.690" style="s2">to talk about the force you know the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.350" end="00:44:34.080" style="s2">next level of complexity at being based</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.690" end="00:44:38.070" style="s2">on AI so I got some sort of background</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.080" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">in AI and I&#39;m a bit of a skeptic for it</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.070" end="00:44:45.210" style="s2">being taken too far so where I was going</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:51.290" style="s2">is that the the the the first two levels</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.210" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">of complexity required some new physical</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.290" end="00:44:56.430" style="s2">so the first level come yes first units</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:58.920" style="s2">connect to cut some physical artifact in</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.430" end="00:45:04.290" style="s2">first case to sell the second case the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.920" end="00:45:06.270" style="s2">brain okay next one didn&#39;t require a new</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.290" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">artifact but a reconfiguration of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.270" end="00:45:13.980" style="s2">brain in more complex ways so my my</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:17.880" style="s2">question is should we not be looking for</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.980" end="00:45:20.940" style="s2">further complex we configurations of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.880" end="00:45:23.820" style="s2">brain to take us to the next level as</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.940" end="00:45:27.090" style="s2">opposed to some new physical silicon</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.820" end="00:45:28.830" style="s2">based artifact right okay so I need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.090" end="00:45:31.590" style="s2">clarify what I meant</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.830" end="00:45:34.260" style="s2">so what I am saying is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.590" end="00:45:35.940" style="s2">digital landscape that is emerging okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.260" end="00:45:37.860" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s all going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.940" end="00:45:40.230" style="s2">be located in an artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.860" end="00:45:41.700" style="s2">all right I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.230" end="00:45:43.560" style="s2">know I don&#39;t think people know what that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.700" end="00:45:46.320" style="s2">is I&#39;m simply saying that the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.560" end="00:45:48.540" style="s2">is being laid down for and the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.320" end="00:45:51.390" style="s2">century is being set for it to see it</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.540" end="00:45:53.790" style="s2">emerge okay and whether that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.390" end="00:45:56.370" style="s2">based on a genuine full-fledged</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.790" end="00:45:58.350" style="s2">artificial intelligence singularity okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.370" end="00:45:59.930" style="s2">or whether it fundamentally emerges</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.350" end="00:46:02.550" style="s2">through collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.930" end="00:46:06.630" style="s2">experiences and a social technical</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.550" end="00:46:08.430" style="s2">psychic web of connection all great</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.630" end="00:46:10.560" style="s2">questions I don&#39;t think we have any idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.430" end="00:46:11.940" style="s2">how artificial intelligence and human</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:15.300" style="s2">intelligence and collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.940" end="00:46:17.430" style="s2">are going to be fused and interface and</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.300" end="00:46:20.460" style="s2">interact to create what</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.430" end="00:46:24.030" style="s2">okay but to me that&#39;s um that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.460" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">unprecedented of the second half of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.030" end="00:46:28.380" style="s2">21st century I don&#39;t know okay but I do</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:30.270" style="s2">know he what the tree of knowledge says</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.380" end="00:46:33.480" style="s2">is that the ingredients are there and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.270" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">something is happening okay to get to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.480" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">your other point I&#39;m I&#39;m a be what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:39.720" style="s2">called a behaviorist rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:42.060" style="s2">physical base oh why I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.720" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">very much clearly what what science</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.060" end="00:46:48.800" style="s2">fundamentally to me about behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:51.060" style="s2">and I&#39;m also very keen on semiotic</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.800" end="00:46:52.620" style="s2">cybernetics information processing</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.060" end="00:46:55.380" style="s2">complex adaptive system kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.620" end="00:46:56.940" style="s2">behavior so you say yes it is true of</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.380" end="00:47:00.390" style="s2">course we didn&#39;t build a whole new brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.940" end="00:47:01.950" style="s2">but I would say actually the brain human</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.390" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">brain built a language acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.950" end="00:47:07.290" style="s2">device information processing system</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:10.140" style="s2">that is very much what I in fact call</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.290" end="00:47:10.680" style="s2">mine three is actually a mind within a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.140" end="00:47:14.340" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.680" end="00:47:15.780" style="s2">okay and functionally the linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.340" end="00:47:19.860" style="s2">system and the language acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.780" end="00:47:21.480" style="s2">device as you explicitly yoked together</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.860" end="00:47:24.360" style="s2">our minds and an inner subjective</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.480" end="00:47:26.870" style="s2">Highway essentially did then enable us</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.360" end="00:47:29.430" style="s2">to create a meta animal consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.870" end="00:47:31.620" style="s2">that allows our self consciousness to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.430" end="00:47:34.950" style="s2">connect with each other so you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.620" end="00:47:37.110" style="s2">if there&#39;s definitely not a physical</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.950" end="00:47:39.840" style="s2">differentiation like the others but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.110" end="00:47:41.910" style="s2">functional form difference of linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.840" end="00:47:43.860" style="s2">language information processing as</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:24.190" style="s2">you for explaining the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.279" end="00:51:27.160" style="s2">in such detail and it was my first time</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.190" end="00:51:30.339" style="s2">learning that so I really appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.160" end="00:51:33.039" style="s2">way that it was articulated my question</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.339" end="00:51:37.269" style="s2">is you mentioned seeing ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.039" end="00:51:39.009" style="s2">narration as well as so and you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.269" end="00:51:42.730" style="s2">talking about the emergence of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.009" end="00:51:46.029" style="s2">cultural digital landscape at the very</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.730" end="00:51:48.420" style="s2">end I did want to ask you about what</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.029" end="00:51:54.069" style="s2">that was called the Oliver Reiser world</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.420" end="00:51:56.950" style="s2">sensorium but okay so um how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.069" end="00:51:59.079" style="s2">internet structures it within the tree</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.950" end="00:52:03.569" style="s2">of knowledge and more specifically</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.079" end="00:52:06.839" style="s2">because you&#39;re coming from a behavior</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.569" end="00:52:09.789" style="s2">perspective it seems like how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.839" end="00:52:13.180" style="s2">psychology playing a role in dealing</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.789" end="00:52:15.460" style="s2">with the maladaptive behaviors in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.180" end="00:52:18.009" style="s2">emerging landscape in the internet</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.460" end="00:52:20.309" style="s2">structures and I have to say I again</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.009" end="00:52:22.930" style="s2">like super appreciate this top because</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.309" end="00:52:25.089" style="s2">my background has been in psychology as</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.930" end="00:52:27.279" style="s2">you can see I&#39;m not putting up my face I</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.089" end="00:52:31.210" style="s2">just would not like to be recorded but</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.279" end="00:52:35.410" style="s2">there&#39;s an icon of the psychology symbol</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.210" end="00:52:37.210" style="s2">upside down so mostly because it also</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.410" end="00:52:40.089" style="s2">looks like the wait symbol I mean it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.210" end="00:52:41.769" style="s2">the wave symbol for I love it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.089" end="00:52:44.019" style="s2">thanks and then when it&#39;s upside down it</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.769" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">also looks like a mathematical symbol</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.019" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">for transverse allottee so I say all</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:54.190" style="s2">that um only because I&#39;m so interested</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:55.809" style="s2">in this part of the the fifth way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.190" end="00:52:57.110" style="s2">looking at things and love to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.809" end="00:53:01.650" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.110" end="00:53:03.060" style="s2">okay so a lot let me break it up into at</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.650" end="00:53:04.950" style="s2">least two parts of the question I heard</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.060" end="00:53:06.900" style="s2">so one was about well what rare is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.950" end="00:53:09.510" style="s2">internet on the tree of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.900" end="00:53:11.250" style="s2">how do you understand that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.510" end="00:53:13.740" style="s2">great question and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.250" end="00:53:15.510" style="s2">know what to have a real P for what the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.740" end="00:53:17.670" style="s2">tree of knowledge is so the key the tree</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.510" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">of knowledge is a map of the unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.670" end="00:53:23.460" style="s2">wave of behavioral complexity okay and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:25.740" style="s2">and I should say it&#39;s a map of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.460" end="00:53:28.350" style="s2">Natural Sciences so what is not on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.740" end="00:53:31.320" style="s2">tree of knowledge are material cultural</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.350" end="00:53:33.590" style="s2">tools which then grow into things like</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.320" end="00:53:36.180" style="s2">the internet so it does not represent</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.590" end="00:53:38.610" style="s2">everything it represents the dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.180" end="00:53:39.930" style="s2">of behavioral complexity so putting a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.610" end="00:53:41.490" style="s2">building on the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.930" end="00:53:43.950" style="s2">actually a building I would characterize</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.490" end="00:53:45.480" style="s2">this material culture and I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.950" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">actually work on a chapter right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.480" end="00:53:50.220" style="s2">that it clarifies the taxonomy of</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:51.420" style="s2">actually how to apply the system okay so</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.220" end="00:53:54.000" style="s2">it does take some practice</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.420" end="00:53:55.680" style="s2">you raised a great question and we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.000" end="00:53:58.320" style="s2">wait a minute where exactly is this</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.680" end="00:54:00.240" style="s2">digital internet thing the form of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.320" end="00:54:02.070" style="s2">behavior that is coalescing around it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:03.330" style="s2">beginning to emerge and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.070" end="00:54:05.850" style="s2">digital landscape will be in</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.330" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">relationship to the concrete artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.850" end="00:54:09.540" style="s2">that give right that are met material</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:11.340" style="s2">culture that&#39;s actually they&#39;re a hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.540" end="00:54:14.460" style="s2">between the material dimension and what</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.340" end="00:54:16.140" style="s2">we humans build human tools at least so</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.460" end="00:54:18.060" style="s2">there&#39;s that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.140" end="00:54:20.070" style="s2">conceptual taxonomy question great</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.060" end="00:54:22.380" style="s2">question and actually something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.070" end="00:54:23.940" style="s2">wrestled with quite a bit and then the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.380" end="00:54:25.320" style="s2">finally the other issue is a totally</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.940" end="00:54:27.840" style="s2">separate question about well what about</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.320" end="00:54:30.750" style="s2">these maladaptive patterns okay and this</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.840" end="00:54:32.940" style="s2">is one of the reasons that I was so keen</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.750" end="00:54:34.500" style="s2">on trying to build a system is that this</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.940" end="00:54:37.170" style="s2">is such an unbelievably complicated</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.500" end="00:54:39.570" style="s2">question that it&#39;s that it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.170" end="00:54:42.090" style="s2">summarize hey I&#39;m gonna summarize it in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.570" end="00:54:43.290" style="s2">the reef first and what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.090" end="00:54:49.530" style="s2">is then whoa because we&#39;re gonna run out</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.290" end="00:54:50.640" style="s2">of time here in 1980 1968 Martin Luther</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.530" end="00:54:52.830" style="s2">King came to the American Psychological</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.640" end="00:54:55.350" style="s2">Association and he opened with such a</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.830" end="00:54:57.270" style="s2">profound and interesting thing that it</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.350" end="00:54:59.670" style="s2">sticks with me when I read the the quote</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.270" end="00:55:01.880" style="s2">he said psychologists you you have given</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.670" end="00:55:04.680" style="s2">us a great word and that word is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.880" end="00:55:06.920" style="s2">maladjusted and he said and there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.680" end="00:55:10.099" style="s2">some things to which we should always be</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.920" end="00:55:11.420" style="s2">maladjusted all right</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.099" end="00:55:12.589" style="s2">so if you&#39;re sitting in the audience in</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.420" end="00:55:15.220" style="s2">your psychologist you&#39;re like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.589" end="00:55:18.170" style="s2">maladjusted IO that&#39;s what I treat</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.220" end="00:55:19.489" style="s2">maladaptive maladjustment and Martin</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.170" end="00:55:20.809" style="s2">Luther King flips it around this ago</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.489" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">actually well what if the person is</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.809" end="00:55:26.119" style="s2">miserable precisely because the society</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:29.150" style="s2">is sick and they&#39;re maladjustment is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.119" end="00:55:31.099" style="s2">sign of health relative to that sickness</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.150" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">if anybody watches you want to put it in</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.099" end="00:55:35.359" style="s2">a family context anybody watches the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:37.970" style="s2">film ordinary people it&#39;s a great 1980</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.359" end="00:55:40.099" style="s2">film won best picture and it shows a kid</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.970" end="00:55:41.839" style="s2">who&#39;s bought his older brother died and</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.099" end="00:55:44.299" style="s2">he&#39;s managing it and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:45.799" style="s2">pathology that manifests in him anybody</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.299" end="00:55:47.839" style="s2">that takes a family system to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.799" end="00:55:49.160" style="s2">instantaneously can say that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.839" end="00:55:51.529" style="s2">director Robert Redford you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.160" end="00:55:55.460" style="s2">maybe the pathology is not in him but</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.529" end="00:55:58.130" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s in what&#39;s around him okay so</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.460" end="00:55:59.930" style="s2">my basic retort to you is the calm the</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.130" end="00:56:02.720" style="s2">idea about what it is that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.930" end="00:56:04.220" style="s2">adapting to how we should adapt how we</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.720" end="00:56:06.200" style="s2">should adapt in a completely novel</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.220" end="00:56:08.029" style="s2">environment and what we should decide to</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.200" end="00:56:10.869" style="s2">be the problems or symptoms of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.029" end="00:56:12.710" style="s2">problems turns out to be a profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.869" end="00:56:15.349" style="s2">complicated set of questions that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.710" end="00:56:17.989" style="s2">pertain to philosophy values your</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.349" end="00:56:19.579" style="s2">overall worldview and the scientific way</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.989" end="00:56:21.380" style="s2">in which you define and that&#39;s why by</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.579" end="00:56:24.229" style="s2">the way the problem of psychotherapy is</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.380" end="00:56:26.329" style="s2">so unbelievably contentious and why</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.229" end="00:56:27.739" style="s2">actually I had to simplify it and jumped</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.329" end="00:56:30.019" style="s2">over to the problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.739" end="00:56:32.779" style="s2">because that nested question of values</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.019" end="00:56:37.789" style="s2">and how you actually then respond well</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.779" end="00:56:41.229" style="s2">that&#39;s a dialogue for a lifetime or</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.789" end="00:56:44.779" style="s2">that&#39;s an invitation back to this Noah</p>
