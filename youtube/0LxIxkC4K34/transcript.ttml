<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">figure out how we&#39;re gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">kind of thing right this was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">things you said in that talk which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">quite a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:13.360" style="s2">where you basically said that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.360" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">and like you have to start with the why</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">why you do things and and but i also</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">love the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">you tell the story of of you walking</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">into your classes with your</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">um thermos cannon and you&#39;re good and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">and people being completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">like culturally not used to that and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">thinking you were</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">kept asking and and i think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">beauty of of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">is that it is a really social ritual um</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">an invitation to sit together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">converse and</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">um a ritual that is ancient</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">yeah it is it is ancient it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">the guaranise you know and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">they they really you know would start</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">the day</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">you know with this ritual of of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">preparing first a sacred fire so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">fire</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">it&#39;s really speaking to to the community</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">that&#39;s why they call it the sacred fire</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">they usually you know would put the wood</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">in a in with with facing north south</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">east and west and then heating the water</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">in the fire</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">and then the water being the female</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">aspect and the board being the male</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">aspect and combining those two and um</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">and allowing each person to drink one</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:50.800" style="s2">gourd in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">and share their dreams what were their</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">he would do he would just interpret the</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">is what we should do today</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">or go on farm and to the chakras</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">the guarani culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">it&#39;s a place where they actually would</p>

<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">daily mantras of sharing the gourd and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">sharing the dreams you know so</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very community oriented and um and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">then at the end of the day they would do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">and just say hey how was the day how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">what did we learn imagine what a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">like that would do to a community</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">imagine how how much</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">trust mutual understanding how how much</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">conflict avoidance like because</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">you didn&#39;t directly hear where most</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">people are coming from in that day</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.600" style="s2">and and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit like i</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">remember at um</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.600" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">living at finton every kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">was always started with an attunement</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">which was a sort of very short</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">check-in but which for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">initially feels like well we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">lot of work to do whether you spend half</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">an hour attuning to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">before we get going but by doing that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">makes the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">the flow afterwards so much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">powerful because you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">um run into frictions because you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">if somebody had a bad dream or a bad</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">morning and and and you much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">attuned to the common goal and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating yeah yes over the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">they&#39;ve been rituals like that but we</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">we all now live in kind of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">or too many of us live in nuclear family</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">situations where that&#39;s completely lost</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">yeah and you know one more thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s you know that we started a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">conversation talking about time</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">and um you know it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">because time is is it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">you can bend time we can bend time</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">we time is something that it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">lineal</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">um some mindset that we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">inherited but for the guaranise</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">time can be bended and how did they bend</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">well for them there was no concept of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">ownership you know it was stewardship</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">yes so it was it was brought by</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">by the first conquistadores coming you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">know to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:05.200" style="s2">to the americas that you know this land</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">is mine and you know and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">that they were surprised</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">with this mindset of of ownership</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">that they they did not practice they</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">in fact um did not believe that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">owned</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">their own life right but</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">that they were not in control of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:32.399" style="s2">and especially of of material</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">you know um ownerships of of they would</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.399" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">burn</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">everything that they would accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">that was the time to to move on and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">migrate</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">and that you during those migrations</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:45.519" style="s2">obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">the weak or the elders or the sick would</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">die</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">and in fact the legend of the yeromati</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">is about you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">a young girl you know in an act of love</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">staying with an elder during these</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">migrations</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">and um and and and deciding to stay with</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">and and in as a gift the</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">um they were free of time</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:18.800" style="s2">because i&#39;ve always for the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.560" style="s2">years i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.800" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">always felt that at the core of</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">into believing that we&#39;re separate</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">um is somewhat a misperception of time</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">or it&#39;s the other way around that this</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:37.440" style="s2">perception of separateness from um</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">the flow that actually brings us forth</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.440" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">makes us feel like</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">there is time um it&#39;s it&#39;s like like</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">what einstein called the illusion of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">of of the separate self um</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">i i sense that so many like even when</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:57.519" style="s2">you were saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">you see yourself more like a channel</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.519" end="00:14:00.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a much more flowing image of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">something flowing through you and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.800" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">manifesting as whatever you do that day</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">um it&#39;s very different from thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">oneself</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">as a being that has to do things in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">and um and i think so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">the real shift to coming home to place</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">and and relationship with plays in each</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:23.519" style="s2">other is about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">that shift of um</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.519" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">yeah being more aware that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because you&#39;re saying they</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">they didn&#39;t think that they could</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.920" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">control their lives the very fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:34.880" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:35.519" style="s2">think we have much control about</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:38.639" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.519" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">is is is actually a huge illusion um</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">and letting go of that makes you so much</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:46.240" style="s2">creative in how you respond to what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">front of you rather than what</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">what you think there should be because</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">of the story you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve been absorbing or told yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">for far too long</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">but but i&#39;d like to come</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">with david that you got together while</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:17.920" style="s2">and do it through running a company</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">together</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">sell computers this is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">interesting because it i think he felt</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">the spirit of the plan you know and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">started drinking you know mate</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">david was the first one to really</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">you know um see it you know and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">understood that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">that this was an enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">you know a for-profit project</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">you know that would would have uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">simply the premises switch so where the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">goal was to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">well we called it at that time you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">market-driven conservation</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">right so it was about conservation then</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">we we changed it to restoration and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">now we&#39;re talking about regeneration but</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">at that time in 1986 when we started</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">together um we we really</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">were coming from from the same paradigm</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">really was very powerful um i think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">by by david really understanding his</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">culture his american</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">it feels like so much what the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">outset of how</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">guayaquil has worked in in argentina</p>

<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">like in in one of the videos which is i</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">think seven years ago you you speak</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">a vision 2020 and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">interesting because we&#39;re talking in</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">um it was back then you said we want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">reforest 200 000 acres of rainforest</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">um through shade ground here</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">but in combination with working with</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">indigenous communities and actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">enable them to protect their forest and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">have a livelihood</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">so that the second the social side of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">that regenerative mission</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">was um giving a livelihood through that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:50.799" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">to a thousand families how close</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.799" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">did you get to that mission</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">well you know we surpassed that mission</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">already um you know we&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">2 000 families um we were working with</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">over 200</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">000 acres and at that time you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:10.799" style="s2">we were just you know using some</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">indicators and you know having</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.799" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">dashboards and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">you know measuring on the impact which</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">is is it it is important</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">to do right and um</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:27.039" style="s2">but um now things have also changed</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">because um now there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.039" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">you you can&#39;t do it anymore by yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:33.840" style="s2">you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">when we started with this mission we</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.840" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">were like okay we&#39;re gonna do this</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">you know our farm suppliers and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">indigenous communities</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:47.280" style="s2">but during these 10 years what has</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">changed is that now we have a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.280" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">many more partners we have national</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">parks</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">we have biosphere reserves</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">you know declared by the united nations</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">or you know from</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">in in these last five years because</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:22.159" style="s2">they they also figured out that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">model of conservation is just like</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">putting a fence</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">around you know national park or or</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">private biosphere</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">was was not enough you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">with all the social actors with all the</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">because otherwise you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">impossible to protect</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">um and the same thing happens in africa</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s highly expensive to put these</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">high huge electric fences to to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">you know to protect the elephants and</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">the most um dangerous species that if</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">they go outside these electric fences</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">they will destroy crops and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">communities right so they have these</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">problems that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">well we can&#39;t have these enormous</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">extensions with electro fences just</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">ridiculous you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make any sense but they</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">figured it out like</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">pinda in south africa figured out that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">they needed to work with the communities</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:27.919" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">and and start working with with the zulu</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">and they became you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.720" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">stewardships of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">of these private reserves of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">national parks and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">the same thing we started doing so</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">we have now you know expanded this</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">this mission of 200 000 acres and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">and 1 000 families and we have surpassed</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">that and now we</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">even working with the amazon ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">and and also paying for the service</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">that the amazon ecosystem is generating</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">through the sky rivers</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:05.840" style="s2">and you know we get to that story like i</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">want to ask you about that because we</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.840" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">had a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">um collaboration in the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">with martin ildebrandt</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">around that project but briefly back to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">this working with the communities</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">um the are you aware that there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">project around</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">the masamara game reserve in kenya that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">is basically it&#39;s a model which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">called land conservancies</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">where um you you work with the local</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">and actually pay them to help conserve</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">the land through more regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">farming um</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">have you looked into that model yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:47.919" style="s2">yeah and and i think you know that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">that is stewardship that&#39;s the concept</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.919" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">of stewardship</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">really and uh by bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">the local communities and bringing in</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">much more resilient than if it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">like you have team there so it&#39;s not not</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">an entire economic transaction it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.000" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a shared mission it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">shared mission so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">you know that&#39;s why we have i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">higher resilience in in these types of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">um and and then at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">not that we control</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">anything it&#39;s we in guayaquil</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">i would say that we work it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">of a pathway</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">that we are you know in</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">going towards uncertainty really and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">in uncertainty is not something that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">are afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">yeah sorry but something that we find</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">that it&#39;s in those areas where things</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">are not controlled</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.399" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">that the answers you know to the</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">precisely yeah this is strongly related</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">like i find that one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">aspects of your new collaboration with</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">all the time and um it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">enough then</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">guayaquil why did we choose that name</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">that&#39;s so hard to pronounce and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">does it</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">mean why a key you know it&#39;s the name of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:36.159" style="s2">our indigenous tribe in paraguay</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">now hunters and nomads that lived in the</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">and at the same time it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">pronounce so</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">with david we we sort of like why a key</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">imagine a door and why do you need a key</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">so and in a way and in a way this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:33:57.519" style="s2">what we do you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it sounds very hippy and sounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.519" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">very you know maybe very artistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s we i think waiakee</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">is an opportunity for for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">that&#39;s part of kaiaki</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">to open doors of perception right</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">to just discover that there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">doors that we can open and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">there and we&#39;re free</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">to open them or not but the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">why we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">is because there&#39;s uncertainty what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">behind the door</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">we&#39;re afraid many times to open them</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:35.280" style="s2">but once you open them it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.280" end="00:34:39.520" style="s2">like love it comes with pain and it</p>

<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the ying and youngs and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">have to allow ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">to enter into that universal</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:58.640" style="s2">perception of life that there is always</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.720" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">measured by all these indicators and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">have our</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:48.480" style="s2">annual impact reports that we you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">are measuring</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">all the aluminum and packaging and you</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.440" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">realized</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">that we were not measuring the water</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">so i was like oh my god you know but</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">might be doing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:23.680" style="s2">or we&#39;re not measuring yet that we will</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">we will measure and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.680" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">as a as a business to do it and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">and i think that with the sky rivers in</p>

<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">it grows in the forest well</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">that ecosystem depends on another</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">huge</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s an area that that it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:20.880" style="s2">it was all public land</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">until martin helped through</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">the colombian congress</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:27.599" style="s2">to to make it indigenous lands and also</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.599" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">but you know protect the all the natural</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">resources below the the soil</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">and and created national parks right</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">that are managed</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">and stored by the indigenous knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">so is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:45.359" style="s2">that because that was one of my my</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">worries um with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.359" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">in so many countries you can be given</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:52.800" style="s2">land ownership but you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t have the ownership for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:55.920" style="s2">underneath the land and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">it&#39;s always the back door for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.920" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">national government to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">um relocate people and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">disown people because they say well</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve discovered a mine underneath your</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">um jurisdiction so so martin actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">protected help to protect that as well</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">exactly by the developing uh you know</p>

<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:25.119" style="s2">national parks and if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">the amazon is a garden has been</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.119" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">really uh managed by the indigenous</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">also like if you spin that cycle even</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">further</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">then so much of the fertility of the</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">is also the the whole sahara desert</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">um like like i shared you know we</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">started with the market driven</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">conservation</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">concept right and then we went to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">market driven restoration</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">and now we&#39;re talking about market</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">driven regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">and where we hold that the regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">we love your definition of regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:28.960" style="s2">you know this capacity of change and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">to to maintain life systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.960" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">and as as we go into into</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">learning more about regeneration we find</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">that the real regenerators</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">in the forest uh the flora and fauna</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.560" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">are the the biggest the mammals that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:49.440" style="s2">trees that you know these are the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">real regenerators and so so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.440" end="00:45:53.119" style="s2">some some you know some are calling it</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">rewilding and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.119" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">you know bringing you know back the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:59.200" style="s2">species that have been extinct</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:00.640" style="s2">and sort of like the the wolf in</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:03.839" style="s2">yellowstone right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.640" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">that has through the cascading effect of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.839" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">the trophic effect</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">has regenerated all the ecosystem back</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">in yellowstone how</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">you know and uh and balanced it right</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">this this is something that&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">in in argentina through the tompkins</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">foundation and um now it&#39;s called rewi</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">is that this is such a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">that the only like bill reid from the</p>

<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">is um he</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:15.760" style="s2">always says that and now i&#39;ve not lost</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">save the world but we can save places</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">but because places are always fractal</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">they&#39;re always that local place that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">local community that</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">specific ecosystem but they&#39;re also the</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">earth they&#39;re everything</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">and so the only way to get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:46.559" style="s2">close to healing the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">through that also healing her people is</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.559" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">to engage</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">people in healing place um</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:54.800" style="s2">local place and and then the ripple</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">effects can be so much</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.800" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">higher than than you could ever imagine</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">because these these people</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">probably were proud to be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">project that over 30 years did that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:08.319" style="s2">amazing work in um south africa but</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been made aware of the fact that</p>

<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">spun off a project that is is vastly</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">larger</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">um in south america it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just beautiful example of of we all</p>

<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">and and that then inspires others</p>

<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:11.839" style="s2">lesson from</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">indigenous people that&#39;s why they</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.839" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">managed to live within bioregional</p>

<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:40.960" style="s2">thinking about um you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">a project in in peru that was</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.960" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">trying to clone some</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.480" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">towers you know and and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.680" end="00:58:51.920" style="s2">in order to to make this process a</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:55.680" style="s2">little bit you know more</p>

<p begin="00:58:59.920" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">shamans from from a local tribe you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">and he said</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">if the jower is gonna disappear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.280" end="00:59:15.040" style="s2">because</p>

<p begin="00:59:26.240" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s it goes beyond what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.920" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">and what we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:38.400" style="s2">you know and and i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:42.799" style="s2">the message there to me is</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.400" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">that if we tap into</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.799" end="00:59:49.760" style="s2">the knowledge that nature has</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">you know glaciers</p>

<p begin="00:59:57.760" end="01:00:03.680" style="s2">millions of years old and we tap into</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.680" end="01:00:07.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:09.440" style="s2">then it&#39;s you know we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:11.200" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna destroy ourselves you</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">know we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.200" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">all of a sudden tap into the knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:21.280" style="s2">the universal knowledge of life</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">yes and we will find our role and</p>

<p begin="01:03:22.240" end="01:03:26.160" style="s2">to address some of the damage that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.400" end="01:03:28.960" style="s2">done over the last few thousand years</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.160" end="01:03:31.280" style="s2">um and to fully reach our potential of</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.960" end="01:03:33.359" style="s2">of being</p>

<p begin="01:06:41.359" end="01:06:45.039" style="s2">living entity</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">and um i&#39;m not only looking at the yerba</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.039" end="01:06:48.559" style="s2">mate which is the main ingredient and</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">the beverages that we make but</p>

<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:56.720" style="s2">sugar you know working together with you</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">know regenerative project in</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.720" end="01:07:01.599" style="s2">brazil of organic for trade sugar and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:03.200" style="s2">um paying attention they&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.599" end="01:07:05.760" style="s2">attention with</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.200" end="01:07:06.400" style="s2">with uh the extract of yerba mate that</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.760" end="01:07:09.680" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.400" end="01:07:10.000" style="s2">done in in brazil and now that company</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:13.359" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.000" end="01:07:16.720" style="s2">is becoming a v corp um so</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.359" end="01:07:20.559" style="s2">we we&#39;re seeing you know that</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.720" end="01:07:24.240" style="s2">an emergence of of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.559" end="01:07:27.359" style="s2">or purpose all along our supply chain</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.240" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2">and around the life cycle of the product</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:31.359" style="s2">and um i think one of the differences</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:32.480" style="s2">that people feel when they drink the</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.359" end="01:07:34.559" style="s2">mate</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.480" end="01:07:36.400" style="s2">in the can even even if it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.559" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">traditional way</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.400" end="01:07:39.839" style="s2">which you know you have all the stems</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">and leaves of the pen</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.839" end="01:07:43.599" style="s2">in here with the 196 active ingredients</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:47.200" style="s2">like you said</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.599" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">i actually say that 197 we&#39;re we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.200" end="01:07:54.160" style="s2">yeah right we&#39;re the other ingredient um</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">it&#39;s when when you</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.160" end="01:07:58.079" style="s2">when you look at the plant at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:07:59.920" style="s2">yavamata plant</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.079" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">and its environment where it grows</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.920" end="01:08:04.480" style="s2">naturally it&#39;s in the forest</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.079" end="01:08:06.880" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s considered a sacred</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.480" end="01:08:10.160" style="s2">plant it&#39;s considered a mother plant</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:12.640" style="s2">because one of those plants that has</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.160" end="01:08:13.599" style="s2">certainly so many active ingredients</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.640" end="01:08:17.679" style="s2">most plants have</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.599" end="01:08:20.560" style="s2">20 40 active ingredients</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.679" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">there&#39;s few plants that have you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.560" end="01:08:24.960" style="s2">200 or above 200</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.799" end="01:08:26.400" style="s2">like the coca leaf or the yamamoto</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.960" end="01:08:28.319" style="s2">marijuana</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.400" end="01:08:31.359" style="s2">you know there is these particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.319" end="01:08:34.239" style="s2">plants have so many active ingredients</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.359" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">because they they are a representation</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.239" end="01:08:40.880" style="s2">of their ecosystem as well</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">right and the yellow mate i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.880" end="01:08:44.239" style="s2">one when we produce the yellow mater</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:47.759" style="s2">drinks we</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.239" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">we create an infusion we put</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.759" end="01:08:51.520" style="s2">infusion like you would you know like</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">you would do it at home with</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.520" end="01:08:54.560" style="s2">hot water and you just put all the herbs</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.839" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">in there</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:57.920" style="s2">and we create an infusion and we heat it</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:08:59.920" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.920" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we pour into our drinks</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.920" end="01:09:02.239" style="s2">together with some of the yerba latte</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:05.520" style="s2">extract</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.239" end="01:09:08.880" style="s2">as well um and this</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.520" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">and ginger and grapefruit and</p>

<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">trade 100 of our sources are fair trade</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:18.239" style="s2">and organic</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:21.359" style="s2">right um and we recently</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.239" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">have also sort of like gone down the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.359" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">path of</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.159" end="01:09:26.159" style="s2">well if there is a if there is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:28.239" style="s2">regenerative certification</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.159" end="01:09:29.839" style="s2">and there is a movement to do it and</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.239" end="01:09:32.319" style="s2">well let&#39;s be part of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.839" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">rock certification so we were part of</p>

<p begin="01:09:36.480" end="01:09:40.640" style="s2">regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.520" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">products called rock right tell me</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.640" end="01:09:44.799" style="s2">tell me a bit more about that because i</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.880" end="01:09:48.080" style="s2">i know that there&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.799" end="01:09:49.839" style="s2">regenerative agricultural that that has</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.080" end="01:09:52.880" style="s2">been developed and i think you were also</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.839" end="01:09:55.440" style="s2">somehow involved in that team</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.880" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">is that right we were involved together</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.440" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">with you know with patagonia dr</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">bronner&#39;s just to mention a few</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:05.840" style="s2">but um to develop this</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">this certification that that goes beyond</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.840" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">organic right that</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:14.400" style="s2">that is trying to to regenerate also</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">you know the the life back into the soil</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:20.000" style="s2">and not just sustain it right um</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">but to increase it and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.000" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">difficult to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.360" end="01:10:24.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something that is completely</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.679" end="01:10:28.080" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.800" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">changing in our practices our you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.080" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">going back to unsavory how do we</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:34.480" style="s2">holistic manage you know don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:36.080" style="s2">blame the resource don&#39;t blame the cow</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.480" end="01:10:39.440" style="s2">don&#39;t play in</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.080" end="01:10:42.560" style="s2">fossil fuel it&#39;s that&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.440" end="01:10:44.480" style="s2">why we have climate change here the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:46.320" style="s2">reason why we have it is because of how</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.480" end="01:10:49.760" style="s2">we manage</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.320" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">right these life supporting systems</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.760" end="01:10:57.920" style="s2">so rock is putting attention to that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:11:00.400" style="s2">looking at the farm as a living system</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.920" end="01:11:04.000" style="s2">and not as a resource</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.400" end="01:11:06.719" style="s2">that you can farm without any</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.000" end="01:11:08.880" style="s2">agrochemicals right but that you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.719" end="01:11:12.159" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.880" end="01:11:15.199" style="s2">regenerate that ecosystem back to</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.159" end="01:11:18.719" style="s2">to its life with the mycociliums and</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.199" end="01:11:21.280" style="s2">um the life below the soil</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.719" end="01:11:22.560" style="s2">above the soil into relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.280" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">interdependences that</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.560" end="01:11:29.840" style="s2">exist among not only the</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:32.800" style="s2">crop that you&#39;re actually farming</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.840" end="01:11:35.199" style="s2">but the crop depends of of all that</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">ecosystem depends on the birds</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.199" end="01:11:38.560" style="s2">it depends on those seeds that the birds</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:41.600" style="s2">bring and that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.560" end="01:11:43.520" style="s2">you know brick trees and that at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.600" end="01:11:47.520" style="s2">same time are retaining the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.520" end="01:11:50.080" style="s2">right amount of shade and humidity</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.520" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">that that soil needs and that all those</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.080" end="01:11:54.400" style="s2">microorganisms</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:57.440" style="s2">need to sustain</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.400" end="01:11:59.199" style="s2">and regenerate life and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.440" end="01:12:01.920" style="s2">more birds to come and there&#39;s then the</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.199" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">tapirs and then the jaguars that eat</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.920" end="01:12:05.040" style="s2">that appears that also need to be there</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">because otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.040" end="01:12:12.480" style="s2">the tapis would just eat everything</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.640" end="01:12:17.840" style="s2">so it&#39;s that looking at at what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.480" end="01:12:21.840" style="s2">farming as a living entity is the key</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.840" end="01:12:24.640" style="s2">you know and when we go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.840" end="01:12:27.920" style="s2">yavamata we put it in a beverage</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.640" end="01:12:28.880" style="s2">this year mate has it&#39;s grown in the</p>

<p begin="01:12:43.360" end="01:12:48.320" style="s2">all the difference it would be really</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.239" end="01:12:51.120" style="s2">interesting in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.320" end="01:12:52.560" style="s2">food science way to analyze the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.120" end="01:12:56.159" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.560" end="01:12:57.120" style="s2">um sun-grown conventional hiramate</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.159" end="01:13:00.640" style="s2">plantations</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.120" end="01:13:02.640" style="s2">um that i mean you you kind of invented</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.640" end="01:13:05.040" style="s2">that the shade grown here ramada process</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.640" end="01:13:05.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.120" end="01:13:14.239" style="s2">to grow commercially in the shade</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.719" end="01:13:15.679" style="s2">because at that time most</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.239" end="01:13:17.600" style="s2">most of the plantations were</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.679" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">monocultures in the sun</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.600" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">or yes we just paid attention to how</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.120" end="01:13:25.600" style="s2">how was it occurring in nature we just</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:28.239" style="s2">paid attention to nature</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.600" end="01:13:29.679" style="s2">you know and just made up like they say</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.239" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">a good farmer is one that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.679" end="01:13:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a good observer</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:38.159" style="s2">you have to observe and</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.760" end="01:13:39.920" style="s2">are there any studies of comparing the</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:42.960" style="s2">the kind of monocultural growth</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.920" end="01:13:46.400" style="s2">here and its ingredients with</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.960" end="01:13:49.440" style="s2">shade grown and how they differ</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.400" end="01:13:51.040" style="s2">yes yes there we have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.440" end="01:13:53.600" style="s2">different studies i mean i wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.040" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">lots of studies there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.600" end="01:13:56.960" style="s2">um but we have one of carbon you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:00.239" style="s2">the carbon</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.960" end="01:14:02.960" style="s2">stock um it goes from 30</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.239" end="01:14:03.840" style="s2">tons a hectare in a sun-grown</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.960" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">conventional</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.840" end="01:14:08.320" style="s2">you know roundup run yerba mate</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:10.560" style="s2">plantation which is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.320" end="01:14:11.600" style="s2">ninety percent of how yellow markets</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.560" end="01:14:15.920" style="s2">grown</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.600" end="01:14:19.120" style="s2">um to 120 when it&#39;s grown in the forest</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.920" end="01:14:20.719" style="s2">so 120 tons that&#39;s one indicator</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.120" end="01:14:22.719" style="s2">the other one that we did measure that</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.719" end="01:14:26.000" style="s2">was really interesting too</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.719" end="01:14:29.040" style="s2">is um the active ingredients</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.000" end="01:14:33.199" style="s2">the the level of each</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.040" end="01:14:36.239" style="s2">active ingredient no um on the aromatase</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.199" end="01:14:39.520" style="s2">shake grown cultivation is higher so</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.239" end="01:14:43.360" style="s2">take potassium iron magnesium</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.520" end="01:14:46.640" style="s2">just imagine through chlorophyll um</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:48.960" style="s2">caffeine um theobromine</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.640" end="01:14:50.320" style="s2">some of these active ingredients are</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.960" end="01:14:53.600" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.320" end="01:14:55.760" style="s2">in the shade grown the versus the</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.600" end="01:14:58.960" style="s2">sunburn it makes sense right</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.760" end="01:15:01.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the the sun grown is stressed</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.960" end="01:15:02.080" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s a stressed plant that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.120" end="01:15:05.600" style="s2">under</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.080" end="01:15:08.800" style="s2">with lack of nutrition yeah where</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.600" end="01:15:12.000" style="s2">the shade grown it&#39;s thriving</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.800" end="01:15:14.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s in its environment no</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.000" end="01:15:16.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s all the active but another</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.400" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">interesting one</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.320" end="01:15:22.159" style="s2">is that when it comes down to airborne</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:25.520" style="s2">contamination</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.159" end="01:15:28.880" style="s2">yes why because the actual shade</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.520" end="01:15:30.800" style="s2">protects the plant</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.880" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">from the yellow material from the</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.800" end="01:15:35.600" style="s2">airborne contaminants</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:38.080" style="s2">they come from you know from china</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.600" end="01:15:39.280" style="s2">they cross in seven to ten days the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.080" end="01:15:42.719" style="s2">pacific</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.280" end="01:15:44.880" style="s2">and they land in all our crops</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.719" end="01:15:46.400" style="s2">in in the americas all around the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.880" end="01:15:49.280" style="s2">now right</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.400" end="01:15:50.880" style="s2">there is a lot of airborne contamination</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.280" end="01:15:53.840" style="s2">in all of our crops</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.880" end="01:15:54.960" style="s2">because of the pollution not only local</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.840" end="01:15:57.600" style="s2">not in the region</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.960" end="01:15:58.480" style="s2">but even the one that&#39;s crossing the</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.600" end="01:16:00.960" style="s2">atlantic</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.480" end="01:16:02.640" style="s2">even micro even micro plastics i mean if</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.960" end="01:16:04.239" style="s2">they find micro plastics at the north</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.640" end="01:16:05.280" style="s2">pole then the micro plastics are also</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.239" end="01:16:08.480" style="s2">raining down on</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.280" end="01:16:10.719" style="s2">the match atlantica for sure so we did</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.480" end="01:16:11.600" style="s2">you know uh what&#39;s called an organic</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.600" end="01:16:15.840" style="s2">test that measures you know hundreds of</p>

<p begin="01:16:19.280" end="01:16:23.199" style="s2">um it&#39;s a very sensitive test very</p>

<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:44.880" style="s2">instrument maker um in the university in</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.159" end="01:16:47.520" style="s2">london</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.880" end="01:16:48.560" style="s2">when they they challenged him to to make</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.520" end="01:16:52.719" style="s2">this thing called the</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.560" end="01:16:55.280" style="s2">electron capture detector and it</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.719" end="01:16:56.239" style="s2">is able to measure such minute</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.280" end="01:16:59.760" style="s2">concentrations</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.239" end="01:17:02.000" style="s2">in air that with without</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.760" end="01:17:03.120" style="s2">that instrument none of the data would</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.000" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">have been generated</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.120" end="01:17:06.719" style="s2">that was the basis of rachel carson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:10.480" style="s2">silent spring</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.719" end="01:17:12.320" style="s2">oh wow i mean just talking in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.480" end="01:17:17.840" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.320" end="01:17:17.840" style="s2">oh man</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.640" end="01:17:23.440" style="s2">so sorry i interrupted you um you you</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.520" end="01:17:27.040" style="s2">would you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.440" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">so we did all these you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.040" end="01:17:30.080" style="s2">samples and you know with our team we</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:33.199" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.080" end="01:17:35.360" style="s2">ethnobotanist teams and and um so</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.199" end="01:17:37.040" style="s2">so we&#39;re looking at different patterns</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.360" end="01:17:40.400" style="s2">and relationships</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.040" end="01:17:42.159" style="s2">that um that would you know all these</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.400" end="01:17:42.480" style="s2">farewells that would determine you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.159" end="01:17:45.360" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.480" end="01:17:47.040" style="s2">what influences all these contaminants</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:50.239" style="s2">or active ingredients</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.040" end="01:17:53.520" style="s2">well when we went to the contaminants we</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.239" end="01:17:56.840" style="s2">we clearly saw that as you would go</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.520" end="01:17:58.000" style="s2">further into the shade grown yaro mate</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.840" end="01:18:01.199" style="s2">plantations</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.000" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">there will be no contaminants as you</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.199" end="01:18:06.480" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:09.360" style="s2">towards the sun grow higher contaminants</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.480" end="01:18:10.719" style="s2">right yeah kind of makes sense because</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.360" end="01:18:13.679" style="s2">they rain down on things</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.719" end="01:18:15.920" style="s2">and if you have a lost canopy above you</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.679" end="01:18:17.679" style="s2">it rains down on the plants above</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.920" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">and what happens with climate change you</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.679" end="01:18:22.800" style="s2">know now so</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">now you have the the conventional</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.800" end="01:18:30.159" style="s2">crops declining in yields</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">year after year obviously there is</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.159" end="01:18:35.280" style="s2">droughts when it rains it pours with</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:36.800" style="s2">rain and it&#39;s like like 300 millimeters</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.280" end="01:18:39.679" style="s2">in 24 hours and</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.800" end="01:18:40.000" style="s2">you know it just kills all the flowers</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.679" end="01:18:43.199" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.000" end="01:18:45.679" style="s2">leaves and it&#39;s a disaster right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.199" end="01:18:46.480" style="s2">the the actual yields of conventional</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.679" end="01:18:49.440" style="s2">crops uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.480" end="01:18:50.640" style="s2">not only of yerba mate are declining</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.440" end="01:18:54.800" style="s2">they&#39;re going down</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.640" end="01:18:57.920" style="s2">what happens this in the shade ground</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.800" end="01:19:00.239" style="s2">they don&#39;t decline they stay</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.920" end="01:19:01.440" style="s2">they stay why because they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.239" end="01:19:04.719" style="s2">resilient</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.440" end="01:19:08.719" style="s2">there&#39;s more humidity in the soil</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.719" end="01:19:11.920" style="s2">if it rains or hail comes it&#39;s protected</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.719" end="01:19:14.239" style="s2">there&#39;s higher resilience there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.920" end="01:19:16.719" style="s2">there&#39;s less contaminants even even that</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.239" end="01:19:18.880" style="s2">even even you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.719" end="01:19:20.960" style="s2">john elkington with violence at that</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.880" end="01:19:23.440" style="s2">time there was also</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.960" end="01:19:24.719" style="s2">a really good friend of mine from school</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.440" end="01:19:28.080" style="s2">working together with him</p>

<p begin="01:19:37.440" end="01:19:41.679" style="s2">at the time yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.640" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">yes and you know alejandro now</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.679" end="01:19:47.679" style="s2">has the the um earth security</p>

<p begin="01:19:52.080" end="01:19:56.000" style="s2">that investments have all around the</p>

<p begin="01:19:56.000" end="01:20:00.480" style="s2">due to climate change right and one of</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.320" end="01:20:03.760" style="s2">the reports he shared with me</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.480" end="01:20:07.040" style="s2">about coffee was</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.760" end="01:20:07.920" style="s2">there is going to be a lack of supply</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.040" end="01:20:10.000" style="s2">and coffee</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.920" end="01:20:11.360" style="s2">in the years to come due to climate</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.000" end="01:20:15.600" style="s2">change because</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.360" end="01:20:18.960" style="s2">coffee depends on a very small window</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.600" end="01:20:22.000" style="s2">of 10 to 15 days of flowering</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.960" end="01:20:24.800" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s it if that</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.000" end="01:20:25.280" style="s2">flower doesn&#39;t get pollenized in those</p>

<p begin="01:20:30.800" end="01:20:34.320" style="s2">and due to climate change you know</p>

<p begin="01:20:34.320" end="01:20:39.840" style="s2">pouring in those days throws all the</p>

<p begin="01:20:39.840" end="01:20:46.560" style="s2">no more crop right or changes in</p>

<p begin="01:20:46.560" end="01:20:51.199" style="s2">community that the coffee plant needs so</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.440" end="01:20:53.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a reduction</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.199" end="01:20:55.600" style="s2">on the yields of coffee and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.679" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">things he proposed as a solution</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.600" end="01:21:02.560" style="s2">is where does how does coffee grow</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">it just let&#39;s go and look at</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.560" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">nature there&#39;s the answers are there</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.760" end="01:21:10.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not rocket science so much of what</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.320" end="01:21:13.199" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.960" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">what we harvest we could plant in</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.199" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">agroforestry systems together with</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:20.000" style="s2">trees that we also selectively</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:23.440" style="s2">regeneratively harvest for</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.000" end="01:21:25.199" style="s2">for biomass or for for by materials for</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.440" end="01:21:27.760" style="s2">other ingredients that aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.199" end="01:21:28.800" style="s2">food plants um and i mean this is this</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.760" end="01:21:31.840" style="s2">is starting to happen</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.800" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">in more and more places um but</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.840" end="01:21:35.280" style="s2">is it happening fast enough i mean i one</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:37.840" style="s2">thing that struck me when i was</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.280" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">looking at some of the past videos is</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.840" end="01:21:40.960" style="s2">that the figures around</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.360" end="01:21:42.800" style="s2">how much of the mata atlantica is</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.960" end="01:21:45.600" style="s2">actually still left of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.800" end="01:21:47.199" style="s2">of the atlantic forest um there were</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.600" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">different figures from five to seven</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.199" end="01:21:52.080" style="s2">percent and i was</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:55.360" style="s2">wondering that that made me wonder um</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.080" end="01:21:56.560" style="s2">is it beginning to grow again or is it</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.360" end="01:21:59.600" style="s2">still declining</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.560" end="01:22:02.800" style="s2">the percentage that is still left</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.600" end="01:22:03.920" style="s2">it it it is still it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.800" end="01:22:06.639" style="s2">stagnant</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.920" end="01:22:07.600" style="s2">right there because it&#39;s those remnants</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.639" end="01:22:10.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.600" end="01:22:12.880" style="s2">in indigenous communities small</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.400" end="01:22:15.360" style="s2">agricultural farmers</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.880" end="01:22:16.159" style="s2">national parks state parks and municipal</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.360" end="01:22:21.199" style="s2">parks that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.159" end="01:22:24.239" style="s2">it yes if you look at that five percent</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.199" end="01:22:27.440" style="s2">those are the stakeholders</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.239" end="01:22:30.400" style="s2">that are living in this remnants</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.440" end="01:22:31.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re holding that five percent</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.400" end="01:22:34.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.520" end="01:22:36.800" style="s2">there&#39;s another issue right</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.560" end="01:22:38.080" style="s2">if that ecosystem depends on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.800" end="01:22:40.800" style="s2">rainfall produced</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.080" end="01:22:41.679" style="s2">by the amazon and the amazon has been</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.800" end="01:22:44.960" style="s2">cut</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.679" end="01:22:45.360" style="s2">then this is going to all be converted</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.960" end="01:22:49.280" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.360" end="01:22:52.080" style="s2">deforestation won&#39;t happen um</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.280" end="01:22:52.719" style="s2">yes the plants start changing you you</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.080" end="01:22:55.760" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.719" end="01:22:58.239" style="s2">to have more you know um</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.760" end="01:22:59.199" style="s2">drought resistant plants that then</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.239" end="01:23:02.400" style="s2">overtake that</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.199" end="01:23:05.840" style="s2">that ecosystem so</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.400" end="01:23:09.360" style="s2">the that&#39;s what carlos nobody</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.840" end="01:23:11.520" style="s2">to is if we if we kill the amazon</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.360" end="01:23:13.600" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a complete change in</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.520" end="01:23:15.920" style="s2">all ecosystems</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.600" end="01:23:33.920" style="s2">one striking thing which is that even</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.960" end="01:23:34.880" style="s2">now we can already see that that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.920" end="01:23:37.199" style="s2">having less</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.880" end="01:23:38.719" style="s2">impact because we slowed down because of</p>

<p begin="01:23:38.719" end="01:23:45.360" style="s2">um same as as um i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:32.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s because of the the pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.840" end="01:24:33.440" style="s2">but what what the report on the negative</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.080" end="01:24:36.960" style="s2">side shows is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.440" end="01:24:40.800" style="s2">that species loss is</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.960" end="01:24:42.400" style="s2">increasing everywhere</p>

<p begin="01:24:44.320" end="01:24:47.840" style="s2">is losing species even faster than</p>

<p begin="01:24:47.840" end="01:24:52.960" style="s2">um but of course along with that and</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.440" end="01:24:55.199" style="s2">along with climate change</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.960" end="01:24:56.000" style="s2">you have a cascade of ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.199" end="01:24:59.120" style="s2">collapses</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.000" end="01:25:00.400" style="s2">and changes of vegetation patterns of of</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.120" end="01:25:02.480" style="s2">things like we use</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.400" end="01:25:03.440" style="s2">alluding to with the coffee of the</p>

<p begin="01:25:03.440" end="01:25:06.880" style="s2">and the pollinated not meeting each</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.280" end="01:25:10.400" style="s2">other anymore because</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.880" end="01:25:11.040" style="s2">the climate zones change in local areas</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.400" end="01:25:12.800" style="s2">even just</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.040" end="01:25:14.400" style="s2">you know and i was talking to edward</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.800" end="01:25:16.560" style="s2">miller and this is in</p>

<p begin="01:25:17.920" end="01:25:21.040" style="s2">on the same mountain you can see how</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.760" end="01:25:23.120" style="s2">things are changing</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.040" end="01:25:24.639" style="s2">because the moisture doesn&#39;t come up the</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.120" end="01:25:25.520" style="s2">mountain as far anymore because because</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.639" end="01:25:28.320" style="s2">of climate</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.520" end="01:25:29.920" style="s2">patterns and so on and that means that</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.320" end="01:25:33.679" style="s2">ultimately we</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.920" end="01:25:37.280" style="s2">more than ever we&#39;re as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.679" end="01:25:39.040" style="s2">learning to be custodians</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.280" end="01:25:41.280" style="s2">and stewards of nature and healing</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.040" end="01:25:42.480" style="s2">influences in the natural ecosystems we</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.280" end="01:25:45.040" style="s2">participate in</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.480" end="01:25:47.120" style="s2">we&#39;re so moving like working with moving</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.040" end="01:25:49.760" style="s2">targets because they&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.120" end="01:25:50.560" style="s2">changing and unfortunately right now</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.760" end="01:25:54.400" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.560" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">um changing in the wrong direction so so</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.400" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.600" end="01:26:02.639" style="s2">how do we actually decide what to plant</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.639" end="01:26:05.280" style="s2">and how in one area</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.639" end="01:26:06.960" style="s2">when we know that in 10 years time that</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.280" end="01:26:08.000" style="s2">area will have a very different climate</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.960" end="01:26:11.440" style="s2">pattern and</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.000" end="01:26:13.199" style="s2">um so so it&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.440" end="01:26:15.360" style="s2">temporal dimension of adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.199" end="01:26:18.080" style="s2">agriculture and anticipatory</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.360" end="01:26:19.120" style="s2">um regenerative agriculture to to know</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.080" end="01:26:21.600" style="s2">what will come</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.120" end="01:26:23.360" style="s2">in 10 years time with climate change and</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.600" end="01:26:26.639" style="s2">anticipate</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.360" end="01:26:29.760" style="s2">by what you planned yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.639" end="01:26:33.199" style="s2">i think um it&#39;s you know and</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.760" end="01:26:35.520" style="s2">add in the fires right so</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.199" end="01:26:36.400" style="s2">into it into the equation and you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.520" end="01:26:38.159" style="s2">all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.400" end="01:26:40.400" style="s2">you know you have tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.159" end="01:26:43.199" style="s2">fires and appearing as well</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.400" end="01:26:44.159" style="s2">in close areas where we&#39;re you know have</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.199" end="01:26:45.760" style="s2">the shade grown</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.159" end="01:26:48.000" style="s2">near a mountain i mean the fires are</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.760" end="01:26:50.960" style="s2">very close so you know we</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.000" end="01:26:53.360" style="s2">we actually train we have a training</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.960" end="01:26:56.719" style="s2">program for all our communities</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.360" end="01:26:58.880" style="s2">to with the fire departments</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.719" end="01:27:00.560" style="s2">and and you know making these barriers</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.880" end="01:27:04.480" style="s2">you know to to</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.560" end="01:27:06.960" style="s2">to sustain from the fire from</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.480" end="01:27:08.000" style="s2">you know moving into these these last</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.960" end="01:27:11.679" style="s2">remnants of</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.000" end="01:27:15.199" style="s2">atlantic forests if you may right so</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.679" end="01:27:17.760" style="s2">um i i mean</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.199" end="01:27:19.520" style="s2">there is a lot of uncertainties right</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.760" end="01:27:22.239" style="s2">and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.520" end="01:27:23.040" style="s2">um we don&#39;t have all the answers and i</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.239" end="01:27:26.560" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.040" end="01:27:29.360" style="s2">answer either um i think</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.560" end="01:27:30.400" style="s2">uh interesting enough even even when you</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.360" end="01:27:33.520" style="s2">grow</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.400" end="01:27:36.560" style="s2">in a permaculture plot crops</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.520" end="01:27:37.600" style="s2">um you can you can imitate the forest in</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.560" end="01:27:41.840" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.600" end="01:27:45.040" style="s2">lettuce and and and um eggplants</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.840" end="01:27:45.520" style="s2">and bananas and you can you can create</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.040" end="01:27:48.400" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.520" end="01:27:49.600" style="s2">the same succession the same dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.400" end="01:27:51.520" style="s2">succession</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.600" end="01:27:53.199" style="s2">that occurs in the forest you can</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.520" end="01:27:56.719" style="s2">imitate in a garden</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.199" end="01:28:00.159" style="s2">and you can create a a micro ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.719" end="01:28:03.520" style="s2">there right that that brings</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.159" end="01:28:05.199" style="s2">back you know the different crops a</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.520" end="01:28:09.360" style="s2">different timing</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.199" end="01:28:12.639" style="s2">and producing it at different seasons</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.360" end="01:28:16.480" style="s2">that allow for the life cycle</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.639" end="01:28:18.880" style="s2">of life to sustain when</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.480" end="01:28:19.760" style="s2">as he said in the beginning diversity is</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.880" end="01:28:23.440" style="s2">the currency</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.760" end="01:28:24.639" style="s2">and the the the here in mallorca for</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.440" end="01:28:28.000" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.639" end="01:28:29.760" style="s2">um traditionally there were 47 or 48</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.000" end="01:28:32.080" style="s2">different types of almond trees that</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.760" end="01:28:33.440" style="s2">people grew around the island because</p>

<p begin="01:28:33.440" end="01:28:37.360" style="s2">um flowers at slightly different times</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.400" end="01:28:39.120" style="s2">of the year and as</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.360" end="01:28:40.960" style="s2">you said like weather is unpredictable</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.120" end="01:28:42.800" style="s2">so sometimes if</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.960" end="01:28:44.320" style="s2">the early flowering ones sometimes get</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.800" end="01:28:46.560" style="s2">lucky because it&#39;s a sunny</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.320" end="01:28:48.080" style="s2">sunny period and the bees are out</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.560" end="01:28:49.600" style="s2">sometimes they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.080" end="01:28:51.120" style="s2">lucky at all because the bees are still</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.600" end="01:28:53.360" style="s2">asleep because the temperature is too</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.120" end="01:28:55.040" style="s2">low and the and the bees come out</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.360" end="01:28:56.719" style="s2">the week after the early flowering</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.040" end="01:29:00.880" style="s2">almonds have basically not been</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.719" end="01:29:03.280" style="s2">been um pollinated and it so so it is</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.880" end="01:29:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the the tendency to towards</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.280" end="01:29:08.480" style="s2">monoculture that made the</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.800" end="01:29:10.639" style="s2">um system so brittle and if we</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.480" end="01:29:11.840" style="s2">have more diversity like luckily we have</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.639" end="01:29:15.360" style="s2">a few years</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.840" end="01:29:16.960" style="s2">we have a few um kind of passionate</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.360" end="01:29:18.880" style="s2">people that like there&#39;s one guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.960" end="01:29:21.760" style="s2">got 200 and some</p>

<p begin="01:31:24.960" end="01:31:30.800" style="s2">and really looking at what</p>

<p begin="01:32:12.800" end="01:32:18.080" style="s2">and he wants to guess what he wants to</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.679" end="01:32:23.040" style="s2">go to california and study food science</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.080" end="01:32:26.880" style="s2">that&#39;s sweet which is great but i want</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.040" end="01:32:29.920" style="s2">i want did i did food science</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.880" end="01:32:33.760" style="s2">but i had to like go around the block</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.920" end="01:32:36.080" style="s2">to to come to the to the essence of</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.760" end="01:32:39.360" style="s2">preparing food again</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.080" end="01:32:42.719" style="s2">how it was done you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.360" end="01:32:43.440" style="s2">thousands of years ago fermented foods</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.719" end="01:32:46.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.440" end="01:32:49.920" style="s2">you know not industrializing</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.800" end="01:32:53.520" style="s2">food as a commodity and</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.920" end="01:32:56.639" style="s2">preserving it for wartimes</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.520" end="01:33:00.480" style="s2">in cans and it&#39;s ridiculous for us to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.639" end="01:33:02.960" style="s2">buying uh tomatoes in a can</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.480" end="01:33:04.159" style="s2">that was that was the food industry the</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.960" end="01:33:06.239" style="s2">food science</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.159" end="01:33:07.440" style="s2">that developed that in order to consume</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.239" end="01:33:10.560" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.440" end="01:33:10.560" style="s2">in wartime</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.400" end="01:33:20.080" style="s2">if if you go to a supermarket</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.639" end="01:33:23.120" style="s2">most of the products they&#39;re filled with</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.080" end="01:33:24.800" style="s2">with packaging and are industrialized in</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.120" end="01:33:27.199" style="s2">in a way to</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.800" end="01:33:28.400" style="s2">look at the expiration date the last two</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.199" end="01:33:32.159" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.400" end="01:33:36.400" style="s2">but we actually by the yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.159" end="01:33:39.920" style="s2">yeah brilliant it&#39;s my bible for</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.400" end="01:33:43.360" style="s2">for so</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.920" end="01:33:46.400" style="s2">so i said i said to my son i said look</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.360" end="01:33:47.440" style="s2">you&#39;re you can go and study food science</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.400" end="01:33:49.920" style="s2">if you want</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.440" end="01:33:50.800" style="s2">and and the whole industrialization of</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.920" end="01:33:53.920" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.800" end="01:33:54.800" style="s2">but here you know you&#39;re already a food</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.920" end="01:33:57.199" style="s2">scientist</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.800" end="01:33:59.440" style="s2">at home he prepares the kefir together</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.199" end="01:34:01.679" style="s2">with his brother seferino</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.440" end="01:34:02.880" style="s2">and they do it every three days and</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.679" end="01:34:06.239" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones in charge</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.880" end="01:34:10.719" style="s2">of doing the kefir which is a fermented</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.239" end="01:34:13.679" style="s2">beverage that feeds our gut</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.719" end="01:34:15.120" style="s2">with the with the i call it the flour</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.679" end="01:34:18.800" style="s2">and fountain it&#39;s not the flour</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.120" end="01:34:22.159" style="s2">but with all the microorganisms that</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.800" end="01:34:25.199" style="s2">build our immune system and that help us</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.159" end="01:34:28.239" style="s2">from getting diseases and um</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.199" end="01:34:31.520" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s that&#39;s the way to go</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.239" end="01:34:35.120" style="s2">really that&#39;s you know if we all do this</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.520" end="01:34:38.560" style="s2">uber you know farming</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.120" end="01:34:41.199" style="s2">in our communities with the crops that</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.560" end="01:34:44.080" style="s2">we have with the figs and mallorca</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.199" end="01:34:44.480" style="s2">with the potatoes in chile chile that</p>

<p begin="01:34:48.159" end="01:34:51.360" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing the forest or in</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.600" end="01:34:55.840" style="s2">california</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.360" end="01:34:57.679" style="s2">we can there there is enough for man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.840" end="01:34:58.960" style="s2">needs but not enough for man&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.679" end="01:35:00.719" style="s2">like like gandhi</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.960" end="01:35:02.639" style="s2">right i mean that was one of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.719" end="01:35:05.840" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.639" end="01:35:08.960" style="s2">that made me in school in food science</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.840" end="01:35:12.159" style="s2">changed my my paradigm as well</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.960" end="01:35:13.119" style="s2">right it was like you know it was a food</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.159" end="01:35:16.400" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.119" end="01:35:19.040" style="s2">course that i took taught by this</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.400" end="01:35:20.159" style="s2">kokumo by this nigerian professor that</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.040" end="01:35:21.920" style="s2">had malaria</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.159" end="01:35:23.600" style="s2">he was a wonderful teacher like we</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.920" end="01:35:24.159" style="s2">always have these teachers that change</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.600" end="01:35:27.280" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.159" end="01:35:30.639" style="s2">our perspectives in in in college</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.280" end="01:35:34.000" style="s2">and this this wonderful professor said</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.639" end="01:35:37.119" style="s2">it was it was why is there hunger</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.000" end="01:35:38.719" style="s2">in the world and there was a question</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.119" end="01:35:41.840" style="s2">that he never answered</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.719" end="01:35:44.320" style="s2">but gave us all the tools</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.840" end="01:35:44.960" style="s2">just just continue asking ourselves that</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.320" end="01:35:48.880" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.960" end="01:35:52.239" style="s2">yeah why is there food</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.880" end="01:35:55.600" style="s2">when we have enough food to grow</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.239" end="01:35:56.239" style="s2">everywhere and supply ourselves with now</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.600" end="01:35:59.600" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.239" end="01:36:04.560" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough for man&#39;s greed</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.600" end="01:36:08.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s where gandhi&#39;s coined that</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.560" end="01:36:11.679" style="s2">statement by saying with greed</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.400" end="01:36:13.600" style="s2">we&#39;re done that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:36:36.000" end="01:36:40.239" style="s2">expert on</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.880" end="01:36:41.840" style="s2">on growing diverse ecosystems he&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.239" end="01:36:44.480" style="s2">a lot of work on chocolate</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.840" end="01:36:46.480" style="s2">with with um kind of green and blacks</p>

<p begin="01:36:51.520" end="01:36:56.159" style="s2">and know more about it i know belize is</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.159" end="01:36:58.880" style="s2">one of the pioneers in</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.159" end="01:37:00.000" style="s2">in regenerating the the coral reefs as</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.880" end="01:37:01.920" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.000" end="01:37:03.840" style="s2">yeah i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s another whole</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.920" end="01:37:06.880" style="s2">story did tom guerrero you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.840" end="01:37:09.679" style="s2">in his work on coral reefs</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.880" end="01:37:10.560" style="s2">otherwise i had a conversation with him</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.679" end="01:37:12.960" style="s2">a while ago</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.560" end="01:37:13.679" style="s2">tom guerrero is this um born in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.960" end="01:37:17.040" style="s2">caribbean</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.679" end="01:37:19.119" style="s2">to both parents marine scientists</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.040" end="01:37:20.560" style="s2">um he&#39;s an atmospheric scientist marine</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.119" end="01:37:23.119" style="s2">scientist whatever</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.560" end="01:37:24.159" style="s2">and and he&#39;s developed to like he worked</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.119" end="01:37:25.920" style="s2">with a guy</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.159" end="01:37:27.600" style="s2">who was doing this for other reasons but</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.920" end="01:37:30.320" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.600" end="01:37:32.080" style="s2">improved the the technology basically</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.320" end="01:37:35.600" style="s2">he&#39;s shown that if you</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.080" end="01:37:37.679" style="s2">um put a small metal grid</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.600" end="01:37:38.800" style="s2">into the ocean like anchored on the</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.679" end="01:37:42.400" style="s2">ocean floor</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.800" end="01:37:45.920" style="s2">and you replant corals in in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.400" end="01:37:47.199" style="s2">in an area where there&#39;s a microcurrent</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.920" end="01:37:48.960" style="s2">of electricity</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.199" end="01:37:50.639" style="s2">that you put onto that metal grid</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.960" end="01:37:54.320" style="s2">underwater then</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.639" end="01:37:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s that micro current that enables</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.320" end="01:38:01.199" style="s2">the coral to take</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.440" end="01:38:03.440" style="s2">energy from that that is used to</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.199" end="01:38:05.199" style="s2">for the basic physiological processes of</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.440" end="01:38:08.000" style="s2">keeping the coral in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.199" end="01:38:09.520" style="s2">but that energy then is freed up for the</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.000" end="01:38:11.840" style="s2">coral to grow quicker</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.520" end="01:38:12.800" style="s2">so he&#39;s demonstrated that by using this</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.840" end="01:38:15.119" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.800" end="01:38:16.000" style="s2">low invasive technique of just putting</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.119" end="01:38:19.040" style="s2">this metal grid which</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.000" end="01:38:22.639" style="s2">eventually dissolves in the ocean</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.040" end="01:38:25.440" style="s2">um you can regrow coral</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.639" end="01:38:26.880" style="s2">at four or five times the rate and more</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.440" end="01:38:29.840" style="s2">then they naturally</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.880" end="01:38:31.840" style="s2">re regenerate and it and he&#39;s recently</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.840" end="01:38:32.960" style="s2">done more studies on sea grass matters</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.840" end="01:38:35.199" style="s2">which are also</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.960" end="01:38:36.239" style="s2">carbon sequesters from from the ocean</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.199" end="01:38:38.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.239" end="01:38:40.480" style="s2">like critically important for ocean</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.000" end="01:38:42.560" style="s2">health and and you can also regrow</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.480" end="01:38:44.400" style="s2">sea grass much faster when you do this</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.560" end="01:38:45.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll send you the link it&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.400" end="01:38:48.560" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.280" end="01:38:51.360" style="s2">but unfortunately i have to um</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.560" end="01:38:51.360" style="s2">finish because</p>

<p begin="01:39:21.520" end="01:39:26.080" style="s2">i think it was it was money nasiru</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.639" end="01:39:28.320" style="s2">there was a couple of speakers that were</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.080" end="01:39:29.920" style="s2">wonderful and talking about the pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.320" end="01:39:31.600" style="s2">and everything and we started off with</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.920" end="01:39:32.880" style="s2">all of the team in guayaquil in south</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.600" end="01:39:35.679" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.880" end="01:39:37.360" style="s2">um watching that and then each one just</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.679" end="01:39:40.239" style="s2">sort of like pointing out</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.360" end="01:39:41.440" style="s2">you know what what was you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.239" end="01:39:44.800" style="s2">identified by</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.440" end="01:39:46.080" style="s2">each individual of these great speakers</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.800" end="01:39:48.800" style="s2">that we&#39;re sharing and</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.080" end="01:39:49.360" style="s2">but anyway from there just went into</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.800" end="01:39:52.480" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.360" end="01:39:55.040" style="s2">your book and we we applied</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.480" end="01:39:55.920" style="s2">sort of your principle of you know of</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.040" end="01:39:58.719" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.920" end="01:39:59.280" style="s2">of the symbol of infinite symbol with</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.719" end="01:40:02.800" style="s2">the four</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.280" end="01:40:06.480" style="s2">elements yeah with with the</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.800" end="01:40:09.840" style="s2">with the that curve that life cycle</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.480" end="01:40:10.719" style="s2">curve of where you know we&#39;re faced with</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.840" end="01:40:13.840" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.719" end="01:40:16.880" style="s2">and rebirth and reorganization</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.840" end="01:40:20.960" style="s2">and regrowth and we we used</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.880" end="01:40:24.480" style="s2">we have used that as our principle</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.960" end="01:40:27.920" style="s2">now in guayaquil in in south america</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.480" end="01:40:28.239" style="s2">to recognize and even in north america</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.920" end="01:40:31.199" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.239" end="01:40:32.480" style="s2">to recognize that we need to allow this</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.199" end="01:40:35.679" style="s2">cycle</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.480" end="01:40:37.920" style="s2">this dynamic cycle to flow</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.679" end="01:40:40.239" style="s2">so i just want to know that i have a</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.920" end="01:40:42.719" style="s2">presentation that it&#39;s documented</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.239" end="01:40:44.639" style="s2">very nicely and in english that i would</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.719" end="01:40:47.920" style="s2">love to share with you because</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.639" end="01:40:51.600" style="s2">it is something that you can also share</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.920" end="01:40:53.360" style="s2">of how your theories and your</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.600" end="01:40:55.040" style="s2">experience in your book and everything</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.360" end="01:40:57.119" style="s2">is being applied also in the in</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.040" end="01:40:58.560" style="s2">in the business wow thanks for that i</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.119" end="01:41:01.679" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.560" end="01:41:03.840" style="s2">the adaptive cycle is kind of distilled</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.679" end="01:41:06.000" style="s2">wisdom of 40 years of the people and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.840" end="01:41:07.840" style="s2">resilience alliance which are ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.000" end="01:41:09.520" style="s2">resilience people buzz hauling and those</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.840" end="01:41:12.639" style="s2">kind of gunderson and so on</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.520" end="01:41:15.360" style="s2">those ecosystem scientists looking at</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.639" end="01:41:16.159" style="s2">change patterns and evolution patterns</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.360" end="01:41:19.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.159" end="01:41:20.800" style="s2">ecosystems and what what basically how</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.280" end="01:41:23.119" style="s2">ecosystems function</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.800" end="01:41:24.560" style="s2">and and that&#39;s what when they distilled</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.119" end="01:41:26.639" style="s2">that they they came to</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.560" end="01:41:28.880" style="s2">the adaptive cycle and the monarchy that</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.639" end="01:41:32.159" style="s2">these adaptive cycles are nested</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.880" end="01:41:34.800" style="s2">through spatial temporal scale linking</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.159" end="01:41:35.440" style="s2">and and so basically it just perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.800" end="01:41:37.520" style="s2">fits</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.440" end="01:41:38.560" style="s2">for a company that that is aligned with</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.520" end="01:41:41.360" style="s2">natural patterns</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.560" end="01:41:42.719" style="s2">and driven as nature for nature to to</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.360" end="01:41:45.280" style="s2">align with those patterns really</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.719" end="01:41:48.560" style="s2">exciting it was perfect it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.280" end="01:41:50.880" style="s2">fantastic it was wonderful so thank you</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.560" end="01:41:53.360" style="s2">and let&#39;s catch up again soon on off</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.880" end="01:41:53.360" style="s2">recording</p>
