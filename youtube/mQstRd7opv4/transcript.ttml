<p begin="00:00:11.630" end="00:00:16.590" style="s2">Jamie we recently put out a film with</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">Daniel called war on sense-making that</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.590" end="00:00:19.980" style="s2">did really really well kind of slightly</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:21.600" style="s2">unexpectedly it sort of really seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.980" end="00:00:23.100" style="s2">catch the zeitgeist and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:25.380" style="s2">you&#39;ve been thinking a lot about some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.100" end="00:00:27.150" style="s2">the same topics in that film what were</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:28.590" style="s2">you struck by and what did you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.150" end="00:00:30.840" style="s2">you wanted to add to that particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.590" end="00:00:33.110" style="s2">conversation I think the first thing it</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">was just amazed at Daniel&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.110" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">fluid flawlessly structured stream of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">consciousness laying that out for</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:42.570" style="s2">whatever it was an hour and 40 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">just thinking holy Daniel you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">like that that is that is some</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">exquisitely articulated and presented</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">I know thesis points and and kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:57.660" style="s2">ecology of the information space he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">describing and I found myself at the end</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.660" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">you know Daniel I have rift on those</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:06.690" style="s2">topics before weren&#39;t hanging out and on</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">two occasions priority I&#39;d even told my</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.690" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">wife Julie I was like yeah I think we</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">got to the point in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">where he almost told me the answer you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">know because he was introducing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">that brilliant metaphor of hey what does</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:21.060" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve talked about rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:23.010" style="s2">games and how that buggers up the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.060" end="00:01:25.770" style="s2">information ecology and you end up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.010" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">win-lose dynamics and you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.770" end="00:01:29.250" style="s2">all of the things that pollute the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">information ecology the the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">signaling the MIS signaling that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">distinctions between truth and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">truthfulness right the the weaponization</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:39.060" style="s2">of content and misinformation and all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:43.250" style="s2">those things and then he was saying well</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.060" end="00:01:45.900" style="s2">hey there are examples of antivirus</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.250" end="00:01:47.940" style="s2">cooperation and introduced the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.900" end="00:01:49.260" style="s2">our organs all doing the thing the liver</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.940" end="00:01:50.610" style="s2">does the thing that kidney does the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.260" end="00:01:53.700" style="s2">thing but together somehow</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.610" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">they boot up into us the idea that one</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.700" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">eye sees without depth perception you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:01:59.790" style="s2">know or peripheral vision you put two</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">together and you get parallax binocular</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:03.870" style="s2">vision you know fantastic and I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:05.640" style="s2">looking and I thought oh fantastic he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.870" end="00:02:08.099" style="s2">actually gonna finish the story and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.640" end="00:02:10.709" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly where it ended that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:12.269" style="s2">your guys interview as well and and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.709" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">I think he just hinted at it at the end</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.269" end="00:02:18.650" style="s2">which was you know the reason that our</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:20.220" style="s2">organs can do that wonderful antipholus</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.650" end="00:02:22.380" style="s2">cooperation into</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.220" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">something more than they are as separate</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.380" end="00:02:27.390" style="s2">parts is because they don&#39;t have egos</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:30.870" style="s2">and agency and the moment we introduce</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.390" end="00:02:33.950" style="s2">egos an agency into the game we&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.870" end="00:02:37.530" style="s2">to the bottom of the slide of game a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.950" end="00:02:41.070" style="s2">rivalries competition and game theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.530" end="00:02:43.830" style="s2">dynamics and that is you know between</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.070" end="00:02:46.830" style="s2">Brett Weinstein&#39;s arguments on</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.830" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">evolutionary biology and Jordan Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.830" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">Daniels discussions of game theory you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">can sort of feel like man that those are</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">incredibly dense forces you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:02:59.100" style="s2">create castles made of sand on top of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">those based on what we&#39;d like the well</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:04.860" style="s2">to be but millions of years of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:08.280" style="s2">evolutionary selection and encoding plus</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.860" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">our cognitive biases and heuristics or</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.280" end="00:03:11.520" style="s2">sort of rules of thumb and shortcuts for</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:14.130" style="s2">the way we do things and think things</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.520" end="00:03:18.209" style="s2">that sort of equals game theory in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:22.470" style="s2">nutshell and I&#39;ve been increasingly sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.209" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">of in grim aw and respect and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.470" end="00:03:28.230" style="s2">appreciation for game theory dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">and largely full hat tip to Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.230" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">Daniel for articulating and expressing</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:35.340" style="s2">that so well so for me the question is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:39.110" style="s2">is how do we break out of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.340" end="00:03:41.940" style="s2">centrifugal force of that rock bottom</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.110" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">denominator and and so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.940" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the kind of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:48.030" style="s2">got me thinking having having seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:50.010" style="s2">Daniels brilliant kickoff to this and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.030" end="00:03:55.620" style="s2">sort of really interested in exploring</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.010" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">well how do we do better than that in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.620" end="00:04:00.450" style="s2">simple way because obviously in game a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:02.610" style="s2">game be as nomenclature is probably new</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.450" end="00:04:05.580" style="s2">to folks I think that was Jim rut and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.610" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">Jordans articulation from several years</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.580" end="00:04:10.230" style="s2">back that is now kind of coming back</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:12.330" style="s2">into the conversation but just to render</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:15.030" style="s2">it in terms that maybe people might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.330" end="00:04:16.440" style="s2">more familiar with is and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.030" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">analogy not necessarily a direct</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.440" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">one-to-one but in many respects game a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:24.090" style="s2">kind of the way we have always done</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:27.000" style="s2">things as humans can be seen as playing</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.090" end="00:04:29.169" style="s2">the finite game right versus game B</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.000" end="00:04:31.870" style="s2">which is arguably the infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.169" end="00:04:33.909" style="s2">James Casas book finite and infinite</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.870" end="00:04:35.409" style="s2">games which introduced and socialized</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.909" end="00:04:37.150" style="s2">the concepts and actually I think simon</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.409" end="00:04:39.129" style="s2">Sinek is just about to come out with</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.150" end="00:04:41.069" style="s2">another book by that title a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.129" end="00:04:44.289" style="s2">different emphasis but yeah the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.069" end="00:04:47.979" style="s2">if a finite game is basically win lose</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.289" end="00:04:50.860" style="s2">and and it&#39;s an arguably might makes</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.979" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">right then the infinite game is is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.860" end="00:04:57.430" style="s2">anti reverse version potentially win-win</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:05:00.610" style="s2">the aim is is right you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.430" end="00:05:01.569" style="s2">just power mix might and the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.610" end="00:05:03.639" style="s2">the infinite game is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.569" end="00:05:05.620" style="s2">winner-takes-all the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.639" end="00:05:08.500" style="s2">infinite game is to create conditions by</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.620" end="00:05:10.270" style="s2">which we all get to keep playing it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.500" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">so in some simple sense if that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.270" end="00:05:13.870" style="s2">analogy that maybe people are familiar</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:16.900" style="s2">with you know we can think of game a to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.870" end="00:05:18.430" style="s2">game be in in those terms and so as we</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.900" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">look around for examples we think I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.430" end="00:05:22.689" style="s2">bloody hell you know like evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:26.979" style="s2">biology that&#39;s a big weight game theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.689" end="00:05:28.839" style="s2">that&#39;s really hard to beat and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.979" end="00:05:30.939" style="s2">got to have something if this is going</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.839" end="00:05:34.180" style="s2">to persist if this is going to work we</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.939" end="00:05:35.560" style="s2">have to have a mode of coherence or you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.180" end="00:05:37.330" style="s2">know what again Daniel and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.560" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">they&#39;ve got so many great neologisms</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.330" end="00:05:42.909" style="s2">what they might call a strong attractor</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:45.460" style="s2">right has to be stronger than ego and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.909" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">ethnocentrism because that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.460" end="00:05:51.129" style="s2">encoded to do so again to and if anybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:53.080" style="s2">hasn&#39;t seen brett weinstein and his wife</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.129" end="00:05:55.330" style="s2">heather hang who&#39;s also an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.080" end="00:05:57.279" style="s2">biologist they did a brilliant interview</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.330" end="00:05:58.389" style="s2">with joe rogan where they discuss gender</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.279" end="00:05:59.620" style="s2">and they discuss all these things but</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.389" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">they wind it all the way back to like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.620" end="00:06:02.649" style="s2">mating habits and birds and all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:06.159" style="s2">kind of things and they say hey look</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.649" end="00:06:08.860" style="s2">before we get into socio-political you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.159" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">know tirades against each other let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.860" end="00:06:12.909" style="s2">just look back at what are the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">foundational substrates that have always</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.909" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">been and let&#39;s take a look at that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">say what are deep structures this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.889" style="s2">what shallower social structures which</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:22.539" style="s2">is something that brett and eric have</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.889" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">said that our evolutionary toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.539" end="00:06:25.810" style="s2">that&#39;s what we have to build with we we</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:28.360" style="s2">can&#39;t start from anywhere other than</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.810" end="00:06:30.550" style="s2">what&#39;s hardwired into us yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.360" end="00:06:31.990" style="s2">anybody that&#39;s holding out solutions for</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.550" end="00:06:34.449" style="s2">us in this day and age that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.990" end="00:06:36.099" style="s2">aspirational right that are very much</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.449" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">relying on the better angels of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.099" end="00:06:41.080" style="s2">nature as it were that is fragile as</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2"> you know the moment you know mike</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.080" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">tyson&#39;s 101 everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:45.669" style="s2">plan till you get hit all right</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.080" end="00:06:48.250" style="s2">everybody&#39;s got a better angel too they</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.669" end="00:06:51.009" style="s2">get bitch-slapped and so the trick is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.250" end="00:06:52.570" style="s2">how do we create conditions to play the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.009" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">infinite game together when things</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.570" end="00:06:57.490" style="s2">aren&#39;t optimal and you know the good</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:07:00.220" style="s2">news is that I think we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.490" end="00:07:02.169" style="s2">have to start from scratch and many of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.220" end="00:07:03.639" style="s2">the building blocks are sort of staring</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.169" end="00:07:06.850" style="s2">us in the face and weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.639" end="00:07:10.660" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of if we can go in go into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.850" end="00:07:14.139" style="s2">burning house fire that are the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.660" end="00:07:16.389" style="s2">culture wars right now and realize that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.139" end="00:07:18.699" style="s2">in fact we have been inching our way</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.389" end="00:07:22.139" style="s2">towards the infinite game for some time</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.699" end="00:07:24.370" style="s2">and it is arguably the Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.139" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">microwave I guess my question at this</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.370" end="00:07:27.610" style="s2">point is how is this related to the war</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:30.220" style="s2">on sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.610" end="00:07:32.680" style="s2">why is sense-making infinite in because</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.220" end="00:07:33.820" style="s2">it was in in daniel&#39;s explanation as</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.680" end="00:07:35.889" style="s2">well we get wind up in the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.820" end="00:07:37.810" style="s2">territory but we got there through sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.889" end="00:07:40.150" style="s2">making why are those two things linked</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.810" end="00:07:43.479" style="s2">well I mean my sense is is that the only</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.150" end="00:07:47.050" style="s2">way we share information is electively</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.479" end="00:07:49.990" style="s2">or with a gender so the question is is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.050" end="00:07:54.340" style="s2">what would inspire or motivate us to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.990" end="00:07:56.410" style="s2">both truthful and true to be open book</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.340" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">and transparent with each other and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.410" end="00:08:00.460" style="s2">fundamentally requires trust and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:03.220" style="s2">fundamentally requires an alignment of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.460" end="00:08:05.740" style="s2">motive and at some sense of shared</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.220" end="00:08:08.260" style="s2">outcomes as long as there&#39;s an ask them</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.740" end="00:08:10.690" style="s2">as long as there&#39;s a win-lose as long as</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.260" end="00:08:13.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a rivalry as dynamic we will</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.690" end="00:08:15.490" style="s2">continue peeing in the pool of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.060" end="00:08:17.470" style="s2">information ecosystem unintentionally</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.490" end="00:08:20.020" style="s2">and intentionally and so we will never</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.470" end="00:08:22.120" style="s2">clean that up the only way we can say</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.020" end="00:08:25.930" style="s2">don&#39;t file our own nest and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.120" end="00:08:28.510" style="s2">all sleep together and so that that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.930" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">sense my sense is that at you know this</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.510" end="00:08:34.300" style="s2">basically the linkage is Daniel got to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:36.610" style="s2">the metaphor of the symbiotic bodily</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.300" end="00:08:39.419" style="s2">system so the question is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.610" end="00:08:39.419" style="s2">learn to play well together</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.360" end="00:08:44.300" style="s2">bottom line is sent you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.740" end="00:08:46.370" style="s2">obstruct it to the level of the war on</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.300" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">sense-making is simply about data and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.370" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">information but it&#39;s really about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:53.270" style="s2">do we as humans and you individually and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:55.630" style="s2">collectively consider salient or</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.270" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">relevant advantageous or disadvantageous</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.630" end="00:09:01.850" style="s2">to our very human agenda and so how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:05.690" style="s2">we add Rao do we address those things</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.850" end="00:09:08.660" style="s2">and agree to open source a thriving and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.690" end="00:09:11.390" style="s2">vibrant information ecology on behalf of</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.390" end="00:09:17.029" style="s2">sentient beings that would be the jam so</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.020" end="00:09:19.670" style="s2">so the idea that we don&#39;t have to start</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.029" end="00:09:22.700" style="s2">from scratch and the fact that you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.670" end="00:09:23.959" style="s2">really and this is right smack dab in</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.700" end="00:09:25.970" style="s2">the middle of the culture wars because</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.959" end="00:09:28.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of critique these days</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.970" end="00:09:29.570" style="s2">particularly in universities as to why</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.339" end="00:09:31.910" style="s2">are we teaching old dead white guys</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.570" end="00:09:33.890" style="s2">right and and we need to have better</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:14.779" style="s2">think there is actually something really</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.390" end="00:10:21.380" style="s2">you really think about the articulation</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.310" end="00:10:24.110" style="s2">of the West why do we and you know</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.500" end="00:24:31.730" style="s2">damn so the only reason the only way we</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.810" end="00:24:34.790" style="s2">get too egocentric is to realize there</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.730" end="00:24:37.070" style="s2">is someone that&#39;s not me the only way we</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.950" end="00:25:58.430" style="s2">I mean humans had never seen our home</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.820" end="00:26:12.620" style="s2">Galactic and go get our shot of that but</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.429" end="00:26:14.990" style="s2">rather than being astronauts you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.620" end="00:26:17.809" style="s2">can we instead perhaps become</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.529" end="00:26:43.549" style="s2">question then is is how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.210" end="00:26:48.169" style="s2">because it&#39;s one thing I mean bottom</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.549" end="00:26:49.220" style="s2">line is we can be anti rivalries right</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.169" end="00:26:52.330" style="s2">when there&#39;s enough to go around</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.220" end="00:26:55.070" style="s2">and and if we&#39;re thinking about</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.380" end="00:27:04.370" style="s2">if it only works when everybody&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.750" end="00:27:07.460" style="s2">enough that is fine but temporary and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.370" end="00:27:13.640" style="s2">and not actually likely to closely match</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.460" end="00:27:14.929" style="s2">our conditions going forward so now</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.640" end="00:27:16.399" style="s2">let&#39;s boil this down to actually like</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.929" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">people because we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.399" end="00:27:19.940" style="s2">systems and history and culture and all</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:22.340" style="s2">that kind of stuff but this really comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.940" end="00:27:26.029" style="s2">down to people it comes down to you in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.340" end="00:27:28.850" style="s2">moment of choice do I open the</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.360" end="00:27:50.600" style="s2">play better together is there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:52.460" style="s2">consistent and sort of I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.600" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">you&#39;d call it sad frustrating concerning</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.460" end="00:27:57.070" style="s2">but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a pattern and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:28:00.169" style="s2">to come up which is that folks are</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.070" end="00:28:04.070" style="s2">discussing these ideas and concepts they</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.169" end="00:28:06.289" style="s2">are realizing yes game a ooh game B yay</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.070" end="00:28:08.419" style="s2">you you think the same things we say</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.289" end="00:28:10.909" style="s2">we&#39;re believing the same beliefs let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.419" end="00:28:13.730" style="s2">get together in play and there is often</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.909" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">an initial spike of enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.730" end="00:28:18.700" style="s2">excitement feeling met and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:21.010" style="s2">holy maybe this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.700" end="00:28:24.190" style="s2">this done right collaboration many of us</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.010" end="00:28:26.740" style="s2">have been carrying the burden solo you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.190" end="00:28:30.370" style="s2">know and a lot of our pause to get to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.740" end="00:28:32.260" style="s2">this conversation have been by exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.370" end="00:28:35.500" style="s2">and exception you know we have found</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.260" end="00:28:37.450" style="s2">ourselves persistently misfit toys you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.500" end="00:28:39.690" style="s2">know persistently cost out of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.450" end="00:28:43.270" style="s2">socially defined norms persistently</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.690" end="00:28:45.190" style="s2">losing at game a not because we are</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.270" end="00:28:48.040" style="s2">necessarily bad at it we might have even</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.190" end="00:28:51.280" style="s2">been able to win at it we&#39;ve just found</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.040" end="00:28:54.190" style="s2">it distasteful or not satisfying or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.280" end="00:28:56.710" style="s2">congruent so there&#39;s a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.190" end="00:28:58.840" style="s2">bumps and scrapes we&#39;ve accumulated</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.710" end="00:29:01.990" style="s2">along the way and then we get to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.840" end="00:29:05.470" style="s2">place where we find our nominal allies</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.990" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">our nominal conspirators those who</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.470" end="00:29:10.870" style="s2">breathe together and there&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:13.500" style="s2">spike of optimism euphoria possibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.870" end="00:29:16.150" style="s2">and then we get to this stutter step</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.500" end="00:29:18.310" style="s2">where I say wait a second if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.150" end="00:29:20.290" style="s2">really gonna do this post egoic thing if</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.310" end="00:29:21.610" style="s2">we&#39;re really going to dump all of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.290" end="00:29:24.670" style="s2">puzzle pieces out that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.610" end="00:29:26.260" style="s2">carrying so carefully right and mix them</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.670" end="00:29:27.880" style="s2">all in together and holy maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.260" end="00:29:30.190" style="s2">there&#39;s even a bigger picture that none</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.880" end="00:29:34.420" style="s2">of us had but our puzzle pieces fit</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.190" end="00:29:37.690" style="s2">together beautifully wait wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.420" end="00:29:40.630" style="s2">am I sure because I&#39;ve taken a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.690" end="00:29:42.790" style="s2">hits to get here and this means giving</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.630" end="00:29:45.310" style="s2">up all control this means giving up all</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.790" end="00:29:48.760" style="s2">safety this giving means that giving all</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.310" end="00:29:52.450" style="s2">guarantees and even my cherished vision</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.760" end="00:29:55.210" style="s2">of the version of the future right that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.450" end="00:29:57.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve been living and dying for and as we</p>

<p begin="00:29:57.100" end="00:30:00.610" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay well I&#39;m self-aware</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.080" end="00:30:03.310" style="s2">enough I think this is actually this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.610" end="00:30:06.010" style="s2">good pain this is productive distress I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.310" end="00:30:08.740" style="s2">think I do need to open and relax into</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.010" end="00:30:10.690" style="s2">this but then something happens</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.740" end="00:30:13.270" style="s2">and there&#39;s a conversation there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.690" end="00:30:15.310" style="s2">decision we start seeing our humanity</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.270" end="00:30:17.350" style="s2">poke back through through all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.310" end="00:30:18.490" style="s2">idealism and we see somebody do</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.350" end="00:30:19.750" style="s2">something that we&#39;re like I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.490" end="00:30:22.540" style="s2">thousand percent sure that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.750" end="00:30:24.700" style="s2">right we see money power influence</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.960" end="00:32:28.780" style="s2">end up more distant from them than we</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.990" end="00:32:31.640" style="s2">are even from the quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.780" end="00:32:35.710" style="s2">opposition and my sense is is okay so</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:38.520" style="s2">how given all that can we recommit to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.710" end="00:32:40.830" style="s2">seeing each other&#39;s light from</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.520" end="00:32:42.570" style="s2">oh there&#39;s light right and my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.830" end="00:32:45.930" style="s2">if you do that like if somebody&#39;s burned</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.570" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">you a few times you&#39;re naive</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.830" end="00:33:01.740" style="s2">don&#39;t remember who gave him that if</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.940" end="00:33:03.900" style="s2">isolate just don&#39;t ever go to King&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.740" end="00:33:04.950" style="s2">Landing in fact I think was Jordan said</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.900" end="00:33:07.170" style="s2">that we were riffing on this he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.950" end="00:33:10.200" style="s2">the rule is if you&#39;re Ned stud don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.170" end="00:33:13.590" style="s2">to King&#39;s Landing so how do we hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.200" end="00:33:16.520" style="s2">honor and courage and you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.590" end="00:33:18.900" style="s2">decency and hold up that infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.520" end="00:33:22.650" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s just not just</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.900" end="00:33:25.980" style="s2">leaving us exposed to get slaughtered by</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.650" end="00:33:28.350" style="s2">those folks still playing game a and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.980" end="00:33:31.410" style="s2">and manipulating the finite game so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.350" end="00:33:34.590" style="s2">can&#39;t be naive right and and and yet on</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.410" end="00:33:37.170" style="s2">the other hand we have to trust we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.590" end="00:33:39.510" style="s2">to trust and in fact there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.170" end="00:33:41.640" style="s2">great book called the trusted advisor it</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.510" end="00:33:42.990" style="s2">comes out of Duke Business School but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.640" end="00:33:43.770" style="s2">highly recommend folks checking out if</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.990" end="00:33:47.160" style="s2">they&#39;re interested but they&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.770" end="00:33:50.280" style="s2">boiled trust into an actual equation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.160" end="00:33:52.020" style="s2">they said that trust is credibility like</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.280" end="00:33:54.900" style="s2">I actually have the capacity to do the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.020" end="00:33:58.200" style="s2">things you think I can reliability</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.900" end="00:33:59.100" style="s2">I do what I say I&#39;m going to plus</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.200" end="00:34:01.740" style="s2">intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.100" end="00:34:04.350" style="s2">I actually feel connected to you and new</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.740" end="00:34:05.730" style="s2">to me I feel that you get my world right</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.350" end="00:34:08.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s a part of your thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.730" end="00:34:11.970" style="s2">process and decisions all divided by</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.360" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">self orientation and so because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.970" end="00:34:16.290" style="s2">the self orientation as the denominator</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:18.690" style="s2">you can destroy a very high schooler</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.290" end="00:34:21.840" style="s2">across the top if somebody is saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.690" end="00:34:23.970" style="s2">not convinced we&#39;re in it for the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.840" end="00:34:27.480" style="s2">reasons I&#39;m not convinced that person</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.970" end="00:34:29.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t covertly playing game a dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.480" end="00:34:33.690" style="s2">rival risk dynamics with game be</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.820" end="00:34:38.490" style="s2">lip-service effectively the the covert</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.690" end="00:34:40.470" style="s2">sociopath right and so Jordan and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.490" end="00:34:42.300" style="s2">have articulated the idea of rule Omega</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.470" end="00:34:44.730" style="s2">and we actually rift on that on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.300" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">last talk together and the idea of rule</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.730" end="00:34:50.770" style="s2">Omega is basically you know and back to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">information ecology is to say I commit</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.770" end="00:34:56.980" style="s2">- presuming that there is signal in your</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:35:00.100" style="s2">noise and then I am going to inquire</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.980" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">until I find the truth that you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.100" end="00:35:04.780" style="s2">holding no matter how messy or noisy it</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:07.560" style="s2">is or as you&#39;re presenting it right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.780" end="00:35:10.150" style="s2">and they actually made an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.560" end="00:35:13.560" style="s2">clarification after that talk we had</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.150" end="00:35:17.560" style="s2">which is that rule Omega cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.560" end="00:35:20.380" style="s2">demanded by another it can only be</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.560" end="00:35:23.619" style="s2">extended based on mutual agreement based</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.380" end="00:35:26.310" style="s2">on that intimacy right but my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.619" end="00:35:30.300" style="s2">is that for us to be able to after</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.310" end="00:35:32.500" style="s2">seeing each other shadow go back to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.300" end="00:35:34.060" style="s2">encouraging each other&#39;s light right I</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.500" end="00:35:37.330" style="s2">mean Goethe it has that great quote he</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.060" end="00:35:39.880" style="s2">says CMN as he is and he will only and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.330" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">always be as he is but see him as he</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.880" end="00:35:45.670" style="s2">could be and should be and he will</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">become what he could be and should be so</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.670" end="00:35:50.200" style="s2">how do we do that right without leaving</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:52.330" style="s2">ourselves exposed right at a time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.200" end="00:35:54.730" style="s2">mission-critical and we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.330" end="00:35:56.650" style="s2">this far let&#39;s not the bed right at</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.730" end="00:35:59.080" style="s2">the end by being overly naive don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.650" end="00:36:03.340" style="s2">the NED stock and so my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.080" end="00:36:06.790" style="s2">rule Omega works best we can create that</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.340" end="00:36:11.350" style="s2">trust right based on that equation if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.790" end="00:36:14.950" style="s2">balance rule Omega with code Omega which</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.350" end="00:36:17.320" style="s2">is that I can commit to not ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.950" end="00:36:19.330" style="s2">your shadow not ignoring those error</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.320" end="00:36:21.430" style="s2">messages but continuing to see you as</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.330" end="00:36:24.970" style="s2">you could be and should be if and only</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.430" end="00:36:29.050" style="s2">if I have the confidence that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.970" end="00:36:32.350" style="s2">priori ahead of the conflict right agree</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.050" end="00:36:34.750" style="s2">- and commit it to a code that is higher</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.350" end="00:36:37.240" style="s2">than ourselves and our own personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.750" end="00:36:38.770" style="s2">preferences because particularly in back</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.240" end="00:36:41.980" style="s2">to the notion of sociopaths right</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.770" end="00:36:46.119" style="s2">particularly in the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.980" end="00:36:49.240" style="s2">culturally relativistic social justice</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.119" end="00:36:51.880" style="s2">world there is a cult of sensitivity and</p>

<p begin="00:36:51.880" end="00:36:55.210" style="s2">weaponized nonviolent communication I</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.920" end="00:36:57.620" style="s2">hear what you&#39;re saying but what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.210" end="00:36:59.540" style="s2">for me is and all that</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.620" end="00:37:01.880" style="s2">right what typically happens if we try</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.540" end="00:37:03.890" style="s2">and clear those issues we get lost in</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.880" end="00:37:05.930" style="s2">that space and I&#39;m like you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.930" end="00:37:09.950" style="s2"> word of it right and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.060" end="00:37:11.600" style="s2">actually just gonna back away from you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.950" end="00:37:13.610" style="s2">now and rather than us having this</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.600" end="00:37:15.890" style="s2">expanded global centric sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.610" end="00:37:18.140" style="s2">concern we end up shrinking our circles</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.890" end="00:37:20.090" style="s2">to the people who we actually still do</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.140" end="00:37:22.130" style="s2">trust and there&#39;s just no way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.090" end="00:37:23.870" style="s2">scales there&#39;s no way if every time we</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.130" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">bump up against another potential ally</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.870" end="00:37:27.350" style="s2">we get the error messages we attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:29.690" style="s2">resolve it seems to be squishy or</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.350" end="00:37:31.910" style="s2">weaponized and our efforts to deepen</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.690" end="00:37:36.650" style="s2">trust actually divide us and create more</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.910" end="00:37:39.500" style="s2">suspicion that&#39;s the wrong vectors so my</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.650" end="00:37:41.720" style="s2">sense is is what could code Omega look</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.500" end="00:37:44.030" style="s2">like and again the same argument about</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.720" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">saying hey we don&#39;t need to build or</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.030" end="00:37:48.410" style="s2">theorize game B from scratch already the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:52.370" style="s2">seeds of the infinite game are actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.410" end="00:37:53.930" style="s2">in our living tradition yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.370" end="00:37:57.020" style="s2">and specifically I mean just you know to</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.930" end="00:37:59.930" style="s2">go back to colonial expansion I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.020" end="00:38:01.610" style="s2">was God awfully brutal but also look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.930" end="00:38:02.870" style="s2">the tribalism look at the factionalism</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.610" end="00:38:04.850" style="s2">look at all the places in the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.870" end="00:38:06.650" style="s2">where there where there are far more</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.850" end="00:38:08.890" style="s2">regressive and in fact we&#39;re seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.650" end="00:38:12.500" style="s2">in the u.s. these days which is takeout</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.890" end="00:38:14.090" style="s2">career professionals install cronies</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.500" end="00:38:16.670" style="s2">this is no different than Salaam Hussein</p>

<p begin="00:38:16.670" end="00:38:20.180" style="s2">populating the Iraqi government we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.290" end="00:38:22.040" style="s2">seeing the resurgence of that that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.180" end="00:38:25.310" style="s2">not an improvement that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.040" end="00:38:27.020" style="s2">advantage so what code can we install so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.310" end="00:38:28.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the infinite game over the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.020" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">last three four or five hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:32.930" style="s2">depending how far back you want to trace</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:34.910" style="s2">it we&#39;ve also got the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.930" end="00:38:38.630" style="s2">right I mean rabbi Hillel who was one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.910" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">the prime inspirations for Jesus of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.630" end="00:38:42.350" style="s2">Nazareth teaching and he basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">cribbed a lot from hello there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.350" end="00:38:47.360" style="s2">story where Hillel was cornered by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:48.440" style="s2">Pharisees and they were basically in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.360" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">showdown because he was a bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.440" end="00:38:52.040" style="s2">iconoclast and shit-stirrer</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.660" style="s2">and and they were like okay you need to</p>

<p begin="00:42:00.910" end="00:42:07.510" style="s2">that we can self police so that each</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.650" end="00:43:24.060" style="s2">great job laying out in the first half</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.290" end="00:43:26.280" style="s2">of this this conversation and he was</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.060" end="00:43:27.840" style="s2">predominantly focusing on the systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.280" end="00:43:28.830" style="s2">and the structures literally the kinda</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.830" end="00:43:33.840" style="s2">exterior quadrants right of system</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.410" end="00:43:36.570" style="s2">society technology and talked a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.840" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">bit about the interior of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.570" end="00:43:39.600" style="s2">making sense of that polluted</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:41.130" style="s2">information ecology and are people</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.600" end="00:43:42.360" style="s2">holding things back I was sharing</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.130" end="00:43:44.550" style="s2">clearly is there a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.360" end="00:43:46.770" style="s2">truth and truthfulness that signal all</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.550" end="00:43:48.690" style="s2">those kinds of important points and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.770" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">we&#39;re all getting to yes yes yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.690" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">now the next crux is how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:58.530" style="s2">collective coherent sense making</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:44:01.080" style="s2">together how do we drop in to what</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.530" end="00:44:03.570" style="s2">Victor Turner the anthropologist called</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.080" end="00:44:04.800" style="s2">communitas right you could also Keith</p>

<p begin="00:44:04.800" end="00:44:07.710" style="s2">Carolina</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.340" end="00:44:09.240" style="s2">you know describes it as group flow and</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.710" end="00:44:11.370" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.240" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">pretty pretty damn near analogous right</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.370" end="00:44:16.050" style="s2">it&#39;s basically the idea of what happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:17.730" style="s2">when we all get together and something</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.050" end="00:44:19.800" style="s2">more than what us each could have come</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.730" end="00:44:23.060" style="s2">up with individually emerges from that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.800" end="00:44:24.900" style="s2">thing right and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.060" end="00:44:27.300" style="s2">wandering and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.900" end="00:44:30.450" style="s2">theorizing there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.300" end="00:44:32.760" style="s2">demonstrable practice yeah and even Otto</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.760" end="00:44:37.950" style="s2">his at MIT he popularized theory you</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.200" end="00:44:44.580" style="s2">modalities around this most of them are</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.750" end="00:44:46.560" style="s2">all about just talking better</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.580" end="00:44:48.780" style="s2">with each other which I don&#39;t find super</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.560" end="00:44:51.570" style="s2">compelling I think that pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.780" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">weak sauce when it comes to overriding</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.570" end="00:44:54.930" style="s2">all of evolutionary biology the</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.790" end="00:45:00.540" style="s2">really adequate they&#39;re aspirational and</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.620" end="00:45:02.010" style="s2">you get a bunch of tightly self-selected</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.540" end="00:45:03.900" style="s2">people in a group like that and they can</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.010" end="00:45:05.370" style="s2">sometimes with a lot of time and effort</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.900" end="00:45:08.760" style="s2">and often not a lot with not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.370" end="00:45:10.290" style="s2">practical outcomes so my sense is if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.760" end="00:45:13.650" style="s2">look at it and you look to see well</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.290" end="00:45:15.960" style="s2">where do people get into communitas</p>

<p begin="00:47:44.200" end="00:47:48.099" style="s2">we&#39;ve done so and we end up in and</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.950" end="00:48:06.309" style="s2">in that light from light shadow from</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.779" end="00:48:07.960" style="s2">shadow experience that we were</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.309" end="00:48:10.539" style="s2">describing earlier I think that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.960" end="00:48:12.190" style="s2">of what happens so you might find a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.539" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">of people that are paying lip service to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.190" end="00:48:16.059" style="s2">shared espoused ideals we get together</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:18.010" style="s2">we say we&#39;re gonna try and do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.059" end="00:48:20.200" style="s2">and whether that&#39;s the early stages of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.010" end="00:48:21.880" style="s2">game be you know you know five ten years</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.200" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">ago you know whether it&#39;s any of the</p>

<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:28.150" style="s2">proofing the world you get a large group</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:29.710" style="s2">of people together they all think</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.150" end="00:48:31.180" style="s2">they&#39;re on a shared mission you start</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.710" end="00:48:32.890" style="s2">getting the error messages you start</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.180" end="00:48:35.230" style="s2">seeing shadow from shadow you start</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.890" end="00:48:36.490" style="s2">increasing doubt and decreasing trust</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.230" end="00:48:37.750" style="s2">and what do people do they typically</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.490" end="00:48:39.609" style="s2">just shrink their sphere of concern</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.750" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">they&#39;re late they create break offs</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.609" end="00:48:42.460" style="s2">right and actually Daniel I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:43.900" style="s2">mentions that in some of his other</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.460" end="00:48:46.270" style="s2">description descriptions of group</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.900" end="00:48:47.789" style="s2">information ecology you create factions</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.270" end="00:48:49.960" style="s2">and defections</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.789" end="00:48:53.020" style="s2">splintering withholding of information</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.960" end="00:48:55.630" style="s2">and basically intuitively while it feels</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.020" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">shitty and it feels like backstab you</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.630" end="00:48:58.930" style="s2">tribal politics quite often once we live</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:01.119" style="s2">through those things it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.930" end="00:49:03.970" style="s2">rational movement which is oh if we</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.119" end="00:49:06.099" style="s2">can&#39;t get there with all of us because</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.970" end="00:49:08.619" style="s2">we can&#39;t trust all of us to know how</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.099" end="00:49:10.539" style="s2">right into play well then the very</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.619" end="00:49:12.460" style="s2">natural thing for me to do is shrink my</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.539" end="00:49:14.859" style="s2">sphere to the people I do still have</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.460" end="00:49:16.210" style="s2">trust with and do think we can cohere</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.859" end="00:49:19.510" style="s2">with until you get smaller and smaller</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.210" end="00:49:21.910" style="s2">but obviously that&#39;s antithetical to any</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.510" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">of our hopes and sense of urgency about</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.910" end="00:49:27.250" style="s2">scaling this thing so step one is just</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:30.339" style="s2">to identify are we right valuing</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.250" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">exclusivity right whatever it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.339" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">get the high hard gold done or do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:39.339" style="s2">privilege inclusivity right and then in</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:42.190" style="s2">the polarities mapping model there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.339" end="00:49:43.900" style="s2">basically saying identify the upsides a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.190" end="00:49:46.870" style="s2">what can happen if we do get it right</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.900" end="00:49:49.420" style="s2">but also identify the downsides what</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.870" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">happens if we over index to this pole</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.420" end="00:49:54.490" style="s2">and we start seeing the negatives right</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:57.130" style="s2">so for exclusivity right it would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.490" end="00:49:58.750" style="s2">that it&#39;s a small agile group of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.130" end="00:50:00.100" style="s2">they&#39;re deeply skilled there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.750" end="00:50:01.060" style="s2">little clutter or distraction and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.100" end="00:50:02.980" style="s2">actually get there</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.060" end="00:50:04.750" style="s2">we get to coherence and we get to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.980" end="00:50:08.050" style="s2">coherence and a high trust low friction</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.750" end="00:50:10.630" style="s2">framework fantastic but the downside of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.050" end="00:50:12.610" style="s2">exclusivity is you leave a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.630" end="00:50:14.830" style="s2">on the sidelines right it can create</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.610" end="00:50:16.330" style="s2">resentment it can create blowback very</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.830" end="00:50:18.580" style="s2">difficult to scale and often turns up</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.330" end="00:50:20.380" style="s2">being sort of tops down dissemination</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.580" end="00:50:23.110" style="s2">right which is you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.380" end="00:50:25.240" style="s2">potentially overly hierarchical or</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.110" end="00:50:26.800" style="s2">exclusive got it all right well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.240" end="00:50:29.500" style="s2">take a look at what happens what are the</p>

<p begin="00:50:29.500" end="00:50:34.450" style="s2">a seat at the table there&#39;s a diversity</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.020" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">of voices there&#39;s an inclusion of former</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.450" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">out groups right there&#39;s a heterodox</p>

<p begin="00:51:31.840" end="00:51:35.410" style="s2">communication and all those things is</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.250" end="00:51:37.960" style="s2">abundant and when you have narcissist or</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.410" end="00:51:40.390" style="s2">sociopaths or just you know chatty</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.960" end="00:51:42.520" style="s2">Cathie&#39;s and needy Ned&#39;s infiltrate</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.390" end="00:51:43.900" style="s2">those scenes and they often do then it</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.520" end="00:51:45.850" style="s2">never gets off the ground so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.900" end="00:51:46.900" style="s2">question is how do we steer between</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.850" end="00:51:50.560" style="s2">those and I think that that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.900" end="00:51:53.390" style="s2">so a couple of examples of that my sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.560" end="00:51:54.849" style="s2">is obviously is there a both/and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.390" end="00:51:58.160" style="s2">is there a way that we can acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.849" end="00:51:59.779" style="s2">this is hard it&#39;s subtle and nuanced and</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.160" end="00:52:01.549" style="s2">it actually requires a surprising amount</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.779" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">of skill and facility and even the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.549" end="00:52:05.509" style="s2">ability to drop ego right now but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:07.849" style="s2">think you knows you&#39;ve explored the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.509" end="00:52:10.009" style="s2">difference between the IDW the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.849" end="00:52:12.230" style="s2">intellectual dark web and what with what</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.009" end="00:52:14.390" style="s2">with the tenor and flavours of some of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.230" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">those conversations versus more of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.390" end="00:52:19.249" style="s2">kind of emerging conversations I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:23.450" style="s2">sense I mean one of them is rational</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.249" end="00:52:27.410" style="s2">separate egos slinging great thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.450" end="00:52:30.499" style="s2">constructs at each other versus people</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.410" end="00:52:31.789" style="s2">looking and listening to play jazz all</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.499" end="00:52:33.739" style="s2">right and so you can make a kid there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.789" end="00:52:35.660" style="s2">almost that watershed moment so how</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.739" end="00:52:37.999" style="s2">might we have the best of both of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.660" end="00:52:39.319" style="s2">things high and hard rare for now and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.999" end="00:52:41.539" style="s2">we&#39;re going to need some we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.319" end="00:52:44.150" style="s2">need a vanguard and on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.539" end="00:52:46.789" style="s2">all of us are none of us we it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.150" end="00:52:53.299" style="s2">critical that we find ways to help this</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.789" end="00:52:55.430" style="s2">propagate so you sketched out the ego to</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.299" end="00:52:57.559" style="s2">ethno to kind of global centric</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.430" end="00:52:59.660" style="s2">perspective which a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.559" end="00:53:01.069" style="s2">probably familiar from ken Wilbur&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.660" end="00:53:02.930" style="s2">for example the idea that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.069" end="00:53:04.640" style="s2">kind of go from one to the other in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.930" end="00:53:06.769" style="s2">society today especially kind of on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:08.989" style="s2">left there&#39;s a real ambivalence or</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.769" end="00:53:11.779" style="s2">outright rejection of nationalism for</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.989" end="00:53:12.890" style="s2">example and ethnocentrism is your sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.779" end="00:53:15.559" style="s2">that that&#39;s something you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.890" end="00:53:17.839" style="s2">through to get to world centric because</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.559" end="00:53:20.269" style="s2">for me certainly I feel like unless</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.839" end="00:53:22.549" style="s2">we&#39;re stable in our individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.269" end="00:53:24.619" style="s2">identities and probably proud of proud</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.549" end="00:53:26.239" style="s2">of our own history it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.619" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">then to bypass straight to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.239" end="00:53:31.400" style="s2">global centric consciousness yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:34.249" style="s2">may think a general premise of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.400" end="00:53:38.779" style="s2">development is that skipping steps leads</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.249" end="00:53:40.700" style="s2">to dissociation and pathology and so the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.779" end="00:53:44.239" style="s2">question of a have we securely enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.700" end="00:53:46.039" style="s2">annexed our ethnic centric awareness I</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.239" end="00:53:48.049" style="s2">think it&#39;s fair to say that the last</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.039" end="00:53:50.420" style="s2">century has been increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.049" end="00:53:51.799" style="s2">dissociative people lived in villages</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.420" end="00:53:52.999" style="s2">that were their parents and their</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.799" end="00:53:54.769" style="s2">grandparents had grown up there was the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.999" end="00:53:56.509" style="s2">migrations to urban areas you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.769" end="00:53:58.279" style="s2">situation that average and American</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.509" end="00:54:00.259" style="s2">families move seven times in their adult</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.279" end="00:54:02.299" style="s2">lives a majority of people live in</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.259" end="00:54:03.859" style="s2">different states than their parents</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.299" end="00:54:05.310" style="s2">their children don&#39;t grow up knowing</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.859" end="00:54:06.840" style="s2">multiple generation</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.310" end="00:54:07.860" style="s2">of their family there&#39;s this absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.840" end="00:54:10.770" style="s2">they&#39;d often don&#39;t even know their</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.860" end="00:54:13.500" style="s2">neighbors Geographic right next doors</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.770" end="00:54:15.960" style="s2">let alone generations of who they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.500" end="00:54:17.700" style="s2">and where they&#39;ve come from so I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.960" end="00:54:20.760" style="s2">you can make a case that we&#39;re in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.700" end="00:54:23.240" style="s2">of aberrant condition developmentally</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.760" end="00:54:26.850" style="s2">we&#39;ve become atomized fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.240" end="00:54:29.100" style="s2">hypermobile non-local consumer</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.850" end="00:54:30.810" style="s2">identities right and so that is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.100" end="00:54:33.360" style="s2">problem and they&#39;ve been some</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.810" end="00:54:35.220" style="s2">fascinating research on kids that do</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.360" end="00:54:37.710" style="s2">know their grandparents on both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.220" end="00:54:39.780" style="s2">the family and just just those extra you</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.710" end="00:54:42.090" style="s2">know just three generations being aware</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.780" end="00:54:44.250" style="s2">of each other being you know decreases</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.090" end="00:54:46.260" style="s2">likelihood of anxiety depression suicide</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.250" end="00:54:47.850" style="s2">whose test scores boost college</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.260" end="00:54:50.670" style="s2">attendance it&#39;s it&#39;s literally that one</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.850" end="00:54:52.560" style="s2">of the most healthy inoculations for a</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.670" end="00:54:55.020" style="s2">kid you know adverse childhood events</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.560" end="00:54:57.240" style="s2">abuse bad things that happening they can</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.020" end="00:54:58.920" style="s2">they are more resilient so it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.240" end="00:55:00.660" style="s2">bit like extending the wheel base on a</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.920" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">car when you have a long limousine and</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.660" end="00:55:03.450" style="s2">it goes down the road it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:05.430" style="s2">smooth when you have a short little</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.450" end="00:55:07.470" style="s2">electric car it&#39;s bumping up and down</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.430" end="00:55:10.920" style="s2">all the way and so when our only</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.470" end="00:55:13.170" style="s2">perspective is our life fractured from</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.920" end="00:55:16.110" style="s2">everything around us the world every hit</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.170" end="00:55:17.550" style="s2">all right sends us spinning so I have</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.110" end="00:55:21.090" style="s2">wondered I thought okay take every</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.550" end="00:55:24.300" style="s2">alt-right neo Nazi Aryan Nation whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.090" end="00:55:28.110" style="s2">give them the 23andme test should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.300" end="00:55:31.470" style="s2">like hey clearly you are yearning for an</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.110" end="00:55:32.130" style="s2">identity right let&#39;s actually steer into</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.470" end="00:55:34.890" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.130" end="00:55:36.510" style="s2">go and study yourself understand where</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.890" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">you are dollars did don&#39;t notice you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.510" end="00:55:40.770" style="s2">not biking I&#39;ll tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:42.990" style="s2">much right and then you get to wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.770" end="00:55:44.730" style="s2">with and incorporate that so I think it</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.990" end="00:55:46.680" style="s2">there is a bit of it go back to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.730" end="00:55:48.720" style="s2">forwards and it&#39;s almost like the houses</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.680" end="00:55:50.490" style="s2">and Hogwarts right you know during the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.720" end="00:55:52.530" style="s2">Quidditch matches we&#39;re tooth and nail</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.490" end="00:55:54.750" style="s2">but at the end of the day against the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.530" end="00:55:56.700" style="s2">Death Eaters were Hogwarts and I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.750" end="00:55:58.980" style="s2">there has to be some element of yes</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.700" end="00:56:02.120" style="s2">let&#39;s go back and truly NX where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.980" end="00:56:05.510" style="s2">from so that we can opt into</p>
