<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:13.620" style="s2">happen with that it goes up on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.210" end="00:00:16.049" style="s2">my channel where all the other solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.620" end="00:00:17.699" style="s2">reasons go but if it&#39;s ever decided that</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.049" end="00:00:20.420" style="s2">something horrific was said and you</p>

<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">down at some point but it goes up on</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:31.349" style="s2">YouTube or or that the idea of also</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:33.600" style="s2">having a split group eventually is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.349" end="00:00:35.370" style="s2">one of them will hopefully recorded the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">one I&#39;m in and then the other one can</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.370" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">choose whether or not they record it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:40.860" style="s2">put it out somewhere there on my channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:43.170" style="s2">or their own but a solution raising is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">structured hour-long conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.170" end="00:00:46.410" style="s2">spend 15 minutes talking about what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:48.390" style="s2">currently do in this space today we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.410" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">talking about hobbies and then 15</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.390" end="00:00:51.420" style="s2">minutes talking about what our ideal</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:53.070" style="s2">future would look like in the in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">realm and then 30 minutes talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.070" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">what we could do to enhance that area of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">our lives or the world with 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">people and $100,000 this is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">most frivolous one that we&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">yet I&#39;m interested in what we what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">come up with because it&#39;s important I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">mean having things that we we enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">doing as I promised Carrie I brought my</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:15.330" style="s2">cross station just to show one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">things that I&#39;ll be stuffed to show you</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:21.470" style="s2">as well wasn&#39;t so if anyone would like</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">to start we spend roughly 15 minutes on</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.470" end="00:01:27.570" style="s2">I&#39;ll let you go first you play I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">necessarily going to go first but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.570" end="00:01:31.890" style="s2">don&#39;t really have hobbies like all</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">throughout my life there&#39;s not like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.890" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">don&#39;t play sports I don&#39;t have a musical</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">instrument I&#39;ve tried to learn guitar</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:39.659" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to learn certain things I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">like following instructions not in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.659" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">world but in crafts and so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:47.070" style="s2">I currently working on it&#39;s cross</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">stitching so it&#39;s so pretty um I guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">I&#39;m following instructions like put this</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:53.899" style="s2">color here and I enjoy doing it I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">enjoyed doing a paint-by-numbers kit</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.899" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">years ago and so I bought canvas and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">paints and then realized I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">actually like painting I like following</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">the guideline and so that is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">little things that I really like doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">though I love going for walks in nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:11.849" style="s2">and I love swinging on swings and so and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:13.750" style="s2">singing with people around campfire and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.849" end="00:02:15.310" style="s2">so those are the end play more games</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.750" end="00:02:17.020" style="s2">so I have some things that I do enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.310" end="00:02:18.490" style="s2">doing with other people kind of only be</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.020" end="00:02:20.110" style="s2">done with other people and then a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.490" end="00:02:22.420" style="s2">things that I that bring me joy that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.110" end="00:02:24.070" style="s2">do I do myself but I guess I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.420" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">consider them hobbies because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.070" end="00:02:30.940" style="s2">not big enough or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">but who else what else what hobbies do</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.940" end="00:02:41.260" style="s2">you guys do how let you go at it on just</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:43.600" style="s2">what&#39;s going around in my head is the is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.260" end="00:02:45.370" style="s2">the size whether that&#39;s relevant to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.600" end="00:02:47.950" style="s2">notion of hobby like how much time you</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.370" end="00:02:50.650" style="s2">spend on it and I&#39;m sort of snod up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.950" end="00:02:52.360" style="s2">there I mean just speaking personally my</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.650" end="00:02:54.580" style="s2">main hobbies I guess in my life have</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.360" end="00:02:56.320" style="s2">been golf but I never really play</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.580" end="00:02:57.550" style="s2">anymore where I am it&#39;s kind of hard to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.320" end="00:02:59.910" style="s2">play especially as I don&#39;t have a car</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.550" end="00:03:03.610" style="s2">but yeah I like cooking I cook every day</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.910" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">like the life I lead now kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.610" end="00:03:06.670" style="s2">hobbies is what I just do every day</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:08.050" style="s2">tinkering around the house and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.670" end="00:03:09.820" style="s2">garden and stuff like that I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.050" end="00:03:11.170" style="s2">not work in the sense that you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.820" end="00:03:13.510" style="s2">on a clock I have to do it and I get</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.170" end="00:03:14.980" style="s2">paid for it and I&#39;ve got a boss and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.510" end="00:03:17.650" style="s2">know what I mean is it so it&#39;s so in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.980" end="00:03:19.720" style="s2">sense everything I do now is hobby like</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.650" end="00:03:22.410" style="s2">so yeah I mean as is so often the case</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.720" end="00:03:26.620" style="s2">with me I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of curious as to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.410" end="00:03:28.780" style="s2">the meaning of the word right I mean can</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.620" end="00:03:30.580" style="s2">you have five your if people are no</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.780" end="00:03:32.739" style="s2">longer required to work for a living</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.580" end="00:03:35.260" style="s2">does the notion of hobby disappear</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.739" end="00:03:37.810" style="s2">entirely or you know do you just have</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.260" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">more time for your hobbies and so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.810" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">is a hobby is a hobby just something</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:42.430" style="s2">that you&#39;d like to do is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:44.230" style="s2">all it is something you do reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:45.910" style="s2">habitually and that gives you pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.230" end="00:03:48.420" style="s2">in some way I think that&#39;s about all</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.910" end="00:03:50.470" style="s2">there is to it to be honest and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.420" end="00:03:54.070" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting one for a solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.470" end="00:03:55.600" style="s2">raising because I it&#39;s not something you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.070" end="00:03:57.549" style="s2">would immediately think would change</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.600" end="00:04:01.269" style="s2">dramatically you know what I mean but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.549" end="00:04:04.890" style="s2">but but maybe maybe yeah so anyway I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.269" end="00:04:08.950" style="s2">stop there okay Rolf do you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.890" end="00:04:12.370" style="s2">well poppies I mean I also have a sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.950" end="00:04:14.590" style="s2">of very or not a very clear dividing</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.370" end="00:04:18.609" style="s2">line between work and and and free time</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.590" end="00:04:22.210" style="s2">because I I work from home i I run a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.609" end="00:04:25.660" style="s2">venue and so I mean I play ice hockey in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.210" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">the winter I really enjoy that so so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.660" end="00:04:31.449" style="s2">sports very kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:32.620" style="s2">would probably be a sort of hobby if I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.449" end="00:04:35.110" style="s2">were to imagine what I would be doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.620" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">when I have some spare time and and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.110" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">really any kind of commitments I will</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:43.599" style="s2">often tinker with technical stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">right now I&#39;m learning to play</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.599" end="00:04:46.690" style="s2">synthesizers and I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:48.610" style="s2">technology behind it is really</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.690" end="00:04:50.740" style="s2">interesting so the sound technology and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.610" end="00:04:55.569" style="s2">the different sound scapes that you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.740" end="00:04:57.909" style="s2">sculpt with it and and we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.569" end="00:05:00.520" style="s2">tinkering a little bit with tunes of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.909" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">music together a few people and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.520" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of hobby and I also like</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:11.009" style="s2">to write I have written some books and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:15.909" style="s2">also write some nonfiction things about</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.009" end="00:05:18.430" style="s2">the visionary stuff and analyzing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.909" end="00:05:21.270" style="s2">world situation and blog posts are</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.430" end="00:05:24.129" style="s2">various kinds that just have been being</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.270" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">caught by some idea and want to get it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.129" end="00:05:29.530" style="s2">out there so it&#39;s all a bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:33.310" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s in the domain of things I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.530" end="00:05:38.889" style="s2">think it&#39;s fun to do and I don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.310" end="00:05:42.130" style="s2">because I get paid but yeah okay well</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.889" end="00:05:44.740" style="s2">there to thousands of nineteen I learned</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.529" end="00:06:24.669" style="s2">got loads of art stuff because when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:27.819" style="s2">went to do creative arts in college and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.669" end="00:06:31.000" style="s2">we did sculpture animation script write</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.819" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">in and all sorts of other things and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.000" end="00:06:34.840" style="s2">was brilliant and I was just like yeah</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.030" end="00:06:46.660" style="s2">things and it turned into an idea for</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.400" end="00:06:50.580" style="s2">something else has gone on but I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.660" end="00:06:52.630" style="s2">about that later right so that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.580" end="00:06:54.040" style="s2">really interests me up a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.630" end="00:06:56.590" style="s2">time left to talk about this section</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.040" end="00:06:58.210" style="s2">because I just picked this as a topic it</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.590" end="00:06:59.830" style="s2">wasn&#39;t you know what I mean something</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.210" end="00:07:02.230" style="s2">burning my carpet what Eric shared and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.830" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">what role it shared like what I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.230" end="00:07:07.480" style="s2">to do is help people create their life</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:10.480" style="s2">so they don&#39;t have that separation hobby</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.480" end="00:07:11.860" style="s2">isn&#39;t work right like find the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.480" end="00:07:13.810" style="s2">that you want to do that you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.860" end="00:07:16.120" style="s2">to get paid for because that is payment</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.810" end="00:07:19.450" style="s2">in and of itself yet we do need our we</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.120" end="00:07:21.100" style="s2">need our needs met and meeting those two</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.450" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">together that that is possibly what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.100" end="00:07:25.780" style="s2">mean when I say I don&#39;t have hobbies is</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.960" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">that I mean game B is my hobby creating</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.780" end="00:07:30.820" style="s2">a better world is my hobby it&#39;s been my</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:32.919" style="s2">hobby since I was a teenager but I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.820" end="00:07:34.390" style="s2">so focused on it that I didn&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.919" end="00:07:35.760" style="s2">other things that brought me joy it</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.390" end="00:07:38.710" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily the sweet sweet</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.760" end="00:07:39.970" style="s2">relaxing nature and now my whole life is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.710" end="00:07:42.430" style="s2">that like I&#39;m like how would I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.970" end="00:07:45.610" style="s2">distinguish between hobby I do what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.430" end="00:07:48.930" style="s2">want to do and it is creating something</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.610" end="00:07:50.979" style="s2">in the world that is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.930" end="00:07:52.360" style="s2">what do they consider a holiday and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.979" end="00:07:54.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be considered something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.360" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">that anyone&#39;s willing to pay me for yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.220" end="00:08:07.210" style="s2">anyway so interesting I like to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:10.120" style="s2">prescribe that&#39;s fun I liked I liked</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.210" end="00:08:12.490" style="s2">playing that as well ironically it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.120" end="00:08:13.870" style="s2">UM the logo kind of for solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.490" end="00:08:15.310" style="s2">because it was a game it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.870" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">board games actually don&#39;t like because</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.310" end="00:08:20.200" style="s2">I don&#39;t do very well and like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:21.550" style="s2">anagrams and mixing them up it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.200" end="00:08:26.169" style="s2">bringing out Scrabble I&#39;m always like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.550" end="00:08:27.820" style="s2">I&#39;m gone but anyway it&#39;s somewhat ironic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.169" end="00:08:29.770" style="s2">that Scrabble is the picture for this</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.820" end="00:08:30.280" style="s2">yeah I just noticed that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.770" end="00:08:34.210" style="s2">noticed</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.280" end="00:08:35.560" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right funny because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.210" end="00:08:43.659" style="s2">so many combinations you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.560" end="00:08:46.089" style="s2">need to think just to the word itself</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.659" end="00:08:47.470" style="s2">again before we move on because actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.089" end="00:08:49.650" style="s2">this notion of playing games with your</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.470" end="00:08:52.300" style="s2">family whatever I think is quite a good</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.650" end="00:08:54.010" style="s2">it&#39;s made though it&#39;s made the dividing</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.300" end="00:08:54.460" style="s2">line clarify because a hobby is more</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.010" end="00:08:55.930" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.460" end="00:08:57.700" style="s2">our hobby is more than just something</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.930" end="00:08:59.140" style="s2">that you do because I used to play card</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.700" end="00:09:00.520" style="s2">games with my family all the time right</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.140" end="00:09:02.110" style="s2">when I was kid but I wouldn&#39;t describe</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.520" end="00:09:05.500" style="s2">that as a hobby a hobby is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.110" end="00:09:07.780" style="s2">that you that you&#39;re looking to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.500" end="00:09:09.280" style="s2">better at right you&#39;re looking to move</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.780" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">in the direction of mastery of I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.280" end="00:09:13.030" style="s2">you may never take it that seriously</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">that you&#39;re seriously after mastery but</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.030" end="00:09:18.100" style="s2">but it is it is something you take it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:20.110" style="s2">more serious than just a pastime right</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.100" end="00:09:23.260" style="s2">it is it is something you dedicate a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.110" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">more of your resources to than just just</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.260" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">a pastime so I think it is it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.090" style="s2">think it is worth exploring because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">think it is actually more important than</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.090" end="00:09:33.910" style="s2">just you like to do it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a part of your personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.910" end="00:09:36.760" style="s2">right as part of your personal growth in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.200" end="00:09:38.340" style="s2">your development is the pursuing of your</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.760" end="00:09:40.360" style="s2">hobbies and getting better at them</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.340" end="00:09:41.710" style="s2">challenging yourself through them I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.360" end="00:09:43.810" style="s2">think there&#39;s an element of challenge</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.710" end="00:09:46.540" style="s2">involved in hobbies which net not</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.810" end="00:09:50.350" style="s2">necessarily in just playing games or</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.540" end="00:09:52.870" style="s2">whatever this is a sprint meters to I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.350" end="00:09:54.280" style="s2">mean that I do painting sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.870" end="00:09:58.660" style="s2">know for instance this thing that behind</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.280" end="00:10:01.030" style="s2">me here this is a painting I made and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.660" end="00:10:02.770" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t really call that a hobby</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.030" end="00:10:04.300" style="s2">because it&#39;s very infrequent then I do</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.770" end="00:10:05.560" style="s2">it when I really have an inspiration so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.300" end="00:10:08.110" style="s2">I mean the more sometimes I find it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.560" end="00:10:11.350" style="s2">difficult to to find the energy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.110" end="00:10:14.710" style="s2">really do it but but when the paints</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.350" end="00:10:17.230" style="s2">they the arts pieces that I have done I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.710" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">have really I really enjoy having them I</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.230" end="00:10:22.570" style="s2">have all of them in my house a few I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:24.400" style="s2">given away but I wouldn&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.570" end="00:10:25.930" style="s2">would call that a hobby because it can</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.400" end="00:10:30.760" style="s2">be really challenging to do something</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.930" end="00:10:33.670" style="s2">which is worthwhile a to realize an</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.760" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">artistic idea that somehow matters to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.670" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">you I have a pain when I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:39.250" style="s2">frequency is not important to the notion</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:41.230" style="s2">of hobby</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.250" end="00:10:44.470" style="s2">actually well less less important than</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.230" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">the notion of doing it with you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.470" end="00:10:48.400" style="s2">your heart and soul kind of thing but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:50.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know what do you guys think this</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.400" end="00:10:54.400" style="s2">frequency important you have to indulge</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.980" end="00:10:56.410" style="s2">in regular assassination it&#39;s like never</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.400" end="00:10:58.180" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve picked up a guitar once I</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.410" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">wanted not to be a hobby but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.180" end="00:11:02.110" style="s2">into my guitar left so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:03.280" style="s2">where it is like frequency has something</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.110" end="00:11:05.340" style="s2">to do with it right if you do something</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.280" end="00:11:07.340" style="s2">once and never again however if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.340" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">frequency like every</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.340" end="00:11:11.000" style="s2">every few years I pick this up and do</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:12.920" style="s2">something with it and that does feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.000" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">like and the idea that it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.920" end="00:11:17.720" style="s2">that you are endeavoring to get better</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:20.990" style="s2">at for me that&#39;s not a requirement but</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.720" end="00:11:22.900" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely I can see how people</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.990" end="00:11:25.550" style="s2">would have that as a requirement like</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.900" end="00:11:26.930" style="s2">that is a beautiful part of the hobby to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.550" end="00:11:30.220" style="s2">try and get better to try and find</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.930" end="00:11:34.970" style="s2">people or maybe more into it and in situ</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.220" end="00:11:36.650" style="s2">that is is a piece of it for sure also</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.970" end="00:11:38.690" style="s2">pathway to community right because if</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.650" end="00:11:41.240" style="s2">you if you are into it then other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.690" end="00:11:43.460" style="s2">who are into it are gonna be you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.240" end="00:11:45.350" style="s2">potential kindred spirits close friends</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.460" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">so there is that also there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.350" end="00:11:49.610" style="s2">community to map through damage some not</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:51.320" style="s2">maybe not all I mean golf for ease hope</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.610" end="00:11:51.650" style="s2">you can play golf on your own well take</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.320" end="00:11:54.950" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.650" end="00:11:58.010" style="s2">no problem as I know and that golf in</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.950" end="00:12:00.680" style="s2">particular I think Golf is a sport that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.010" end="00:12:02.300" style="s2">people enjoy or they don&#39;t and because</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.680" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s so focused on in society is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.300" end="00:12:06.110" style="s2">business hobby right like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:08.270" style="s2">something you have to do around the team</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.110" end="00:12:10.490" style="s2">bring your business partners and do it</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.270" end="00:12:11.780" style="s2">the people are like forced to do it when</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.490" end="00:12:13.010" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.780" end="00:12:14.420" style="s2">lot of people who can&#39;t even though they</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.010" end="00:12:17.740" style="s2">would love to do it can&#39;t afford to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.420" end="00:12:22.010" style="s2">it and so there is a bigger piece in the</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.110" end="00:12:30.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because is it something</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:31.970" style="s2">that just brings you joy right like I</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.740" end="00:12:34.370" style="s2">don&#39;t think we should not have calls</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.970" end="00:12:37.810" style="s2">because it&#39;s not but it should be for</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.370" end="00:12:41.530" style="s2">people who want to do it it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.810" end="00:12:41.530" style="s2">land that we use</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.980" end="00:12:46.130" style="s2">yeah listen no this is relevant in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.690" end="00:12:51.080" style="s2">defense of God it&#39;s not actually as</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.130" end="00:12:52.460" style="s2">expensive very much an elite thing you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.080" end="00:12:54.410" style="s2">had to be very wealthy to play and be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.460" end="00:12:55.820" style="s2">member of a club but that is that is no</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.410" end="00:12:57.860" style="s2">longer the case last twenty years or so</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.820" end="00:12:59.720" style="s2">it&#39;s really become a lot more financial</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.860" end="00:13:01.730" style="s2">like I go for a walk around a golf</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.720" end="00:13:03.320" style="s2">course every day and I weld the cove it</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.730" end="00:13:05.930" style="s2">was on and they weren&#39;t open I walked on</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.320" end="00:13:07.280" style="s2">the golf course their feet like this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.930" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">the golf course it should be but I get</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.280" end="00:13:12.500" style="s2">why they&#39;re not but and that is a public</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:15.020" style="s2">one and it&#39;s still 60 70 bucks to play</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.500" end="00:13:16.520" style="s2">around like it&#39;s still not cheap it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.020" end="00:13:18.920" style="s2">not you don&#39;t have to be a millionaire</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.520" end="00:13:20.810" style="s2">but you can&#39;t do it on minimum wage</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.920" end="00:13:24.290" style="s2">either without it being completely</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.810" end="00:13:26.930" style="s2">like like the frisbee golf III just</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.290" end="00:13:29.840" style="s2">looked up hoppy on the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.930" end="00:13:31.940" style="s2">the King axis that it is an activity</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.840" end="00:13:34.460" style="s2">that someone does for pleasure when they</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.940" end="00:13:38.300" style="s2">are not working and another definition</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.460" end="00:13:43.339" style="s2">here was an activity done regularly in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.300" end="00:13:45.260" style="s2">one&#39;s leisure time for pleasure and but</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.339" end="00:13:48.140" style="s2">I think that there&#39;s so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.260" end="00:13:50.930" style="s2">hobby and there&#39;s also an adjacent thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.140" end="00:13:52.760" style="s2">which is creative self-expression which</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.930" end="00:13:56.170" style="s2">which I sort of related</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.760" end="00:14:01.580" style="s2">they sort of criss cross somehow and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.170" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">that creative self-expression can be at</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.580" end="00:14:04.400" style="s2">times it can be painful</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">like I&#39;ve written some books that it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.400" end="00:14:09.500" style="s2">really you know it was hard to birth</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:11.930" style="s2">because I had to dive into things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.500" end="00:14:13.670" style="s2">were definitely not pleasurable but</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.930" end="00:14:17.650" style="s2">afterwards it was very big satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.670" end="00:14:20.960" style="s2">to have done it and so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.650" end="00:14:23.390" style="s2">there&#39;s some gray hairs here and if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.960" end="00:14:25.490" style="s2">are going to discuss what we would do if</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.390" end="00:14:30.470" style="s2">we had 10,000 people and 100,000 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.490" end="00:14:32.150" style="s2">in this domain I think that it might be</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.470" end="00:14:34.820" style="s2">worthwhile just to get a little yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.150" end="00:14:36.860" style="s2">because if if it&#39;s more in the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.820" end="00:14:38.630" style="s2">artistic expression self expression</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.860" end="00:14:41.330" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing and if it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.630" end="00:14:43.460" style="s2">leisure activities it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.330" end="00:14:45.290" style="s2">different I&#39;ve just looked up the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.460" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">etiology of it which can sometimes be</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.290" end="00:14:49.940" style="s2">very interesting and this it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:52.490" style="s2">quite funny so hobby is a small active</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.940" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">horse short for haben probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.490" end="00:14:56.390" style="s2">originally a proper name for a horse the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:59.060" style="s2">modern sense of a favorite pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.390" end="00:15:01.670" style="s2">object or topic is from 1816 a</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.670" end="00:15:04.550" style="s2">blah blah blah earlier it meant a wooden</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.570" end="00:15:16.710" style="s2">anywhere I&#39;m always thinking like a</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.330" end="00:15:29.810" style="s2">trivial right it&#39;s just something you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.190" end="00:15:31.760" style="s2">for pleasure and it&#39;s not it has no</p>

<p begin="00:16:11.510" end="00:16:18.080" style="s2">thing that&#39;s I&#39;d like to create more</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.740" end="00:16:26.900" style="s2">haven&#39;t got the space or the room to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.960" end="00:16:29.450" style="s2">anything like that and and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.900" end="00:16:31.100" style="s2">with up cycled stuff like stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.450" end="00:16:33.290" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get sold to charity shops</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.100" end="00:16:35.540" style="s2">upcycle that and turn that into</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.290" end="00:16:37.130" style="s2">something and you know and do do</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.540" end="00:16:41.180" style="s2">projects and things like that so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.130" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">love and of them my idea will to be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.180" end="00:16:45.080" style="s2">big room that you could just go and play</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:47.090" style="s2">out in with whatever stuff was there and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.080" end="00:16:49.160" style="s2">people would just let you and there be</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.090" end="00:16:51.710" style="s2">other people and be like an after-school</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.160" end="00:16:53.480" style="s2">Club for adults that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.710" end="00:16:54.920" style="s2">see because everything&#39;s geared toward</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.480" end="00:16:56.300" style="s2">kids but what about when you get to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.920" end="00:17:01.940" style="s2">certain age and you want to play out</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.300" end="00:17:04.459" style="s2">there&#39;s nowhere to go that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.940" end="00:17:06.339" style="s2">I&#39;d like right thanks Kari never else</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.459" end="00:17:10.520" style="s2">want to share their vision of a future</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.339" end="00:17:12.290" style="s2">hobby endeavor well I guess the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.520" end="00:17:13.250" style="s2">future of a hobby would be what they had</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.290" end="00:17:14.900" style="s2">in the Star Trek next generation</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.250" end="00:17:16.790" style="s2">holodecks right I mean you can do</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.900" end="00:17:19.280" style="s2">absolutely do you know what I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.790" end="00:17:20.510" style="s2">the universe is your limit in there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.280" end="00:17:22.459" style="s2">so you know you can do and learn</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.510" end="00:17:24.050" style="s2">absolutely anything at all so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.459" end="00:17:27.230" style="s2">that&#39;s but that&#39;s somewhat of a fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.050" end="00:17:30.560" style="s2">right I guess in a more sort of game be</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.230" end="00:17:32.210" style="s2">way if you could remove all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.560" end="00:17:33.980" style="s2">jobs from society moving move the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.210" end="00:17:35.540" style="s2">property remove the rent-seeking you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.980" end="00:17:37.670" style="s2">know what I mean all all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.540" end="00:17:40.370" style="s2">automate what&#39;s consensus but all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.670" end="00:17:42.770" style="s2">boring repetitive hard dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.370" end="00:17:44.600" style="s2">that can be automated is automated and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.770" end="00:17:46.520" style="s2">so now you know instead of the average</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.600" end="00:17:48.230" style="s2">person working 50 hours a week the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.520" end="00:17:48.470" style="s2">average person&#39;s working say ten hours a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">week</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.470" end="00:17:52.490" style="s2">something like that right and and and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">now leisure time is actually pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.490" end="00:17:58.850" style="s2">your whole life right I mean now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:18:01.669" style="s2">thinking and so yeah I mean I and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.850" end="00:18:03.890" style="s2">that I think you know if people have</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.669" end="00:18:06.500" style="s2">that kind of freedom and prosperity then</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.890" end="00:18:08.929" style="s2">those things which people wish to engage</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.500" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">in as hobbies will be catered to by do</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.929" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">you not I mean it&#39;ll sort itself out I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:14.150" style="s2">really don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need for</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:16.700" style="s2">any kind of external direction they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.150" end="00:18:19.460" style="s2">just sort itself out and up but I liked</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.700" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">Kerry&#39;s idea of like open spaces that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.460" end="00:18:24.770" style="s2">you can easily make into whatever for a</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:25.909" style="s2">short period of time and people do a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.770" end="00:18:27.530" style="s2">thing and then it can become another</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.909" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">thing really easily in that I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.530" end="00:18:34.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really good idea well</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:35.809" style="s2">I think that you know growing up I grew</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.250" end="00:18:37.400" style="s2">up in a small community and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.809" end="00:18:43.100" style="s2">things that I have there one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.400" end="00:18:45.470" style="s2">fondest memories is that like most</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.100" end="00:18:47.990" style="s2">summer nights we would play soccer or</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.470" end="00:18:49.789" style="s2">football in essen cold in Denmark we had</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.990" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">like these open lawns and we like there</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.789" end="00:18:54.860" style="s2">were like six houses and there were a</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:56.840" style="s2">lot of open lawns and you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.860" end="00:18:58.580" style="s2">summer time we fed the families was</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.840" end="00:19:00.770" style="s2">usually grill at home and and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.580" end="00:19:02.659" style="s2">around 7 o&#39;clock all the kids they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.770" end="00:19:04.490" style="s2">like tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu and they will</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.659" end="00:19:06.710" style="s2">find each other in these open space and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.490" end="00:19:08.539" style="s2">they would say play football until we</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.710" end="00:19:12.530" style="s2">couldn&#39;t see anything anymore hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.539" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">and and so I think that that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.530" end="00:19:15.620" style="s2">things that I would really love and also</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:16.730" style="s2">what I&#39;ve I&#39;m sort of endeavouring a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.620" end="00:19:19.309" style="s2">little bit to create here you know I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.730" end="00:19:22.490" style="s2">have a community project and that right</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.309" end="00:19:23.870" style="s2">now we are that that we&#39;re hoping to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.490" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">permission to build a lot of houses and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.870" end="00:19:30.049" style="s2">to recreate something of that because</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:33.940" style="s2">there is so much value in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.049" end="00:19:39.679" style="s2">unstructured activities there from</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.940" end="00:19:41.179" style="s2">intelligent community contexts and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.679" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">structured activities are very much</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.179" end="00:19:47.720" style="s2">different there we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:49.640" style="s2">structured activities and in schools and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.720" end="00:19:52.010" style="s2">extracurricular this and in in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.640" end="00:19:55.640" style="s2">Denmark is like national hobby is to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.010" end="00:19:58.399" style="s2">create associations for hobbies kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.640" end="00:19:59.990" style="s2">thing so I mean there&#39;s so many spaces</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.399" end="00:20:01.990" style="s2">where people explore there and I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.990" end="00:20:04.110" style="s2">in the modern sort of welfare</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.990" end="00:20:07.030" style="s2">where people have substantial free time</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:08.679" style="s2">and also it&#39;s a market there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.030" end="00:20:11.890" style="s2">that and also that&#39;s a mark of a culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.679" end="00:20:13.720" style="s2">society that where there is time for</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.890" end="00:20:15.820" style="s2">leisure personally I do not subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.720" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">the theory that that will be possible to</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.820" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">bring everybody&#39;s work down two to ten</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:23.350" style="s2">hours I think there are dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:26.230" style="s2">that prevent that but we could create a</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.350" end="00:20:30.670" style="s2">society with with substantially short</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.230" end="00:20:34.809" style="s2">time for everyone and and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.670" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">a cultured society and so personally I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.809" end="00:20:39.610" style="s2">would like to see the architecture of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:41.740" style="s2">our communities and our cities created</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.610" end="00:20:46.030" style="s2">for the answer the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.740" end="00:20:52.030" style="s2">unstructured activities of different</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.030" end="00:20:53.830" style="s2">kinds the frivolous topic I&#39;m like right</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.030" end="00:20:56.260" style="s2">so what I want is the exact world I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.830" end="00:20:57.970" style="s2">creating which is everyone has nearly</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.260" end="00:21:00.280" style="s2">unlimited leisure time they&#39;re choosing</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.970" end="00:21:02.590" style="s2">what to do with their time in the area</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.280" end="00:21:04.510" style="s2">of work that they&#39;re choosing to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.590" end="00:21:06.130" style="s2">because it&#39;s their passion and their</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.510" end="00:21:08.740" style="s2">genius not because they&#39;re necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.130" end="00:21:10.990" style="s2">getting paid for it but in the area of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.740" end="00:21:15.670" style="s2">hobbies specifically I would like to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.990" end="00:21:18.460" style="s2">able to try new things without having to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.670" end="00:21:20.410" style="s2">put in a lot of resources so for</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.460" end="00:21:21.790" style="s2">instance if I D like how many people</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.410" end="00:21:23.650" style="s2">have bought a guitar and they never</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.790" end="00:21:25.270" style="s2">played and sits there for the vast</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.650" end="00:21:27.040" style="s2">majority like being able to share in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.270" end="00:21:29.410" style="s2">those resources to say hey I just want a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.040" end="00:21:32.679" style="s2">guitar for six months to know if it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.410" end="00:21:35.740" style="s2">thing before I invest it one and having</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.679" end="00:21:36.790" style="s2">the ability to create community around</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.740" end="00:21:38.530" style="s2">that is there someone who&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.790" end="00:21:41.620" style="s2">sit with me to teach me guitar those</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.530" end="00:21:43.660" style="s2">YouTube videos can we sit together in</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.620" end="00:21:46.690" style="s2">community and try to play right even</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.660" end="00:21:49.900" style="s2">when were when were brand-new giving the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.690" end="00:21:53.650" style="s2">the ability to the individual no matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.900" end="00:21:56.530" style="s2">how skilled they are in the hobby or in</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.650" end="00:21:59.080" style="s2">finding people to do the hobby he the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.530" end="00:22:01.030" style="s2">tools they would need to be able to live</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.080" end="00:22:02.590" style="s2">their best leisure life right so whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.030" end="00:22:04.840" style="s2">that&#39;s art whether that sport whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.590" end="00:22:08.020" style="s2">that&#39;s unstructured looking at structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.840" end="00:22:10.090" style="s2">the unstructured I think how can we like</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.020" end="00:22:12.100" style="s2">the kids neat this time on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.090" end="00:22:13.630" style="s2">courts if we&#39;re not lucky enough to live</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.100" end="00:22:15.580" style="s2">an intentional community where that just</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.630" end="00:22:18.460" style="s2">happens naturally and then let</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.580" end="00:22:20.890" style="s2">let it emerge that what is needed for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.460" end="00:22:22.990" style="s2">hoppy hobby is resort is is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.890" end="00:22:24.970" style="s2">individual but also the resources needed</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.990" end="00:22:27.490" style="s2">whether that&#39;s the maker spaces or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.970" end="00:22:29.230" style="s2">stuff that goes into creating it and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.490" end="00:22:31.810" style="s2">space right the soccer field if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.230" end="00:22:33.550" style="s2">playing soccer or a field a ball a space</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.810" end="00:22:35.860" style="s2">to do that and to be able to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.550" end="00:22:37.540" style="s2">that so that you can say hey I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.860" end="00:22:39.910" style="s2">play I wanna play soccer tonight right I</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.540" end="00:22:41.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know who else is game for that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.910" end="00:22:45.370" style="s2">make it easy to do that even if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.890" end="00:22:47.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know the people to coordinate that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.370" end="00:22:49.420" style="s2">in a way it makes it even easier for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.680" end="00:22:51.580" style="s2">individual and then I would like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.420" end="00:22:52.870" style="s2">timeline for myself like a calendar to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.580" end="00:22:56.380" style="s2">know where I&#39;m doing these different</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.870" end="00:22:57.880" style="s2">activities and how do I get there and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.380" end="00:22:59.860" style="s2">does all of the executive functioning</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.880" end="00:23:01.480" style="s2">then I think you have to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.860" end="00:23:09.550" style="s2">football by the way you&#39;re out number</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.480" end="00:23:13.090" style="s2">three so once it&#39;s true we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.550" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">Europe sometimes we hold on to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.090" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">American Way because we have Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:23.320" style="s2">football and American football that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:24.700" style="s2">you know can I just circle back to what</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.320" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">Rolf was saying about the emerge because</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.700" end="00:23:28.900" style="s2">I know it was similar to what I said and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:32.980" style="s2">I completely agree with you making room</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.900" end="00:23:35.110" style="s2">for to emerge right but they that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.980" end="00:23:37.060" style="s2">also leads to because stuff which</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.110" end="00:23:38.410" style="s2">emerges which is good which other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.060" end="00:23:39.820" style="s2">want to play what other people want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.410" end="00:23:42.340" style="s2">do as well you know then that then that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.820" end="00:23:45.010" style="s2">spreads and you know if it&#39;s a new thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.340" end="00:23:47.890" style="s2">at some point it gets codified or</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.010" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">instantiated in some way right and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.890" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">you know structures develop around it</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">leagues and competitions and meetings</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.540" end="00:23:57.100" style="s2">and festivals and blah blah blah you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:58.870" style="s2">know equipment development and all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.100" end="00:24:01.870" style="s2">this kind of stuff grows up around it so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.870" end="00:24:05.700" style="s2">it&#39;s the emergence is really really</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.870" end="00:24:08.380" style="s2">important because this is what fuels new</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.700" end="00:24:10.690" style="s2">structures and institutions and society</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.380" end="00:24:13.150" style="s2">wide endeavors and practices you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.690" end="00:24:17.320" style="s2">what I mean so that but there does also</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.150" end="00:24:18.970" style="s2">need to be it can&#39;t be too generative</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.320" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">right if it&#39;s too generative nothing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.970" end="00:24:22.150" style="s2">ever sticks you know what I mean nothing</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:24.370" style="s2">ever gets a foothold and sticks and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.150" end="00:24:26.500" style="s2">there there there&#39;s there&#39;s a balance to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.370" end="00:24:29.320" style="s2">be so as always with everything right</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.500" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a balance to be struck here</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.320" end="00:24:33.909" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a point in</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:35.230" style="s2">this whole lecture thing there are two</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.909" end="00:24:38.019" style="s2">points I would like to make here first</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.230" end="00:24:42.100" style="s2">one is you know like there&#39;s this Eric</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.019" end="00:24:44.710" style="s2">saying that a glad man is a man with a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.100" end="00:24:46.809" style="s2">huge pile of stuff on his desk and happy</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.710" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">man is a pile it&#39;s a man with a pile</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.809" end="00:24:53.049" style="s2">it&#39;s too big for him to handle so so</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:56.019" style="s2">there&#39;s this element of challenge having</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.049" end="00:24:59.649" style="s2">a challenge brings satisfaction I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.019" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">that if you gave every people all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.649" end="00:25:03.340" style="s2">opportunities they wanted they would</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:05.169" style="s2">very quickly find a way to turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.340" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">a challenge because we need challenges</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.169" end="00:25:10.750" style="s2">we need to overcome things because</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:13.659" style="s2">that&#39;s in our nature and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.750" end="00:25:15.549" style="s2">another aspect of that which is hey I</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.659" end="00:25:19.450" style="s2">don&#39;t know how are you familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.549" end="00:25:21.250" style="s2">spiral dynamics I am yeah yes okay so if</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.450" end="00:25:24.879" style="s2">you consider this spiral for instance</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.250" end="00:25:26.559" style="s2">the tribal meme now the tribal means</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.879" end="00:25:31.090" style="s2">hobby is to conquer other tribes</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:33.700" style="s2">basically and so there are this well</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.090" end="00:25:35.830" style="s2">just I mean mean humorous about it but</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.700" end="00:25:39.190" style="s2">but that&#39;s the core of there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.830" end="00:25:40.990" style="s2">dominant genes that want to spread and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.190" end="00:25:42.490" style="s2">think it&#39;s in nature you know weed they</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.990" end="00:25:45.700" style="s2">just spread certain things you know they</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.490" end="00:25:47.830" style="s2">just spread people empires they spread</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.700" end="00:25:49.870" style="s2">so there is this dynamic in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.830" end="00:25:51.789" style="s2">that things want to grow until they hit</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.870" end="00:25:54.399" style="s2">a limit of something that can limit it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.789" end="00:25:56.649" style="s2">and I don&#39;t see this as a bad thing I</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.399" end="00:25:59.139" style="s2">think it&#39;s just a natural thing like</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.649" end="00:26:01.929" style="s2">like you know water running down a hill</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.139" end="00:26:03.250" style="s2">like a water slide it&#39;s very forceful</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.929" end="00:26:05.320" style="s2">and can be very dangerous if you are</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.250" end="00:26:08.110" style="s2">standing in the path but it&#39;s not evil</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.320" end="00:26:09.340" style="s2">it&#39;s just running downhill and and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.110" end="00:26:11.980" style="s2">it&#39;s just with a lot of things I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.340" end="00:26:15.070" style="s2">these nature things that evolution can</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.980" end="00:26:16.809" style="s2">be tough you know are you either you you</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.070" end="00:26:19.480" style="s2">fight and you struggle to survive if</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.809" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">you&#39;re in the savanna you know it&#39;s eat</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.480" end="00:26:25.629" style="s2">or be eaten and what is very important</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:28.419" style="s2">about that is while it is tough on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.629" end="00:26:29.950" style="s2">individual it&#39;s good for the race and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.419" end="00:26:31.750" style="s2">if you if you sort of make this</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.950" end="00:26:33.909" style="s2">distinction you can say there are many</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.750" end="00:26:36.399" style="s2">things that we as individual finds are</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.909" end="00:26:38.379" style="s2">difficult and tough and hard but if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.399" end="00:26:41.260" style="s2">take the helicopter and look at it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.379" end="00:26:43.490" style="s2">will see that it benefits us as a race</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.260" end="00:26:46.399" style="s2">as a country</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.490" end="00:26:50.419" style="s2">countries that do not face adversity</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.399" end="00:26:54.110" style="s2">they grow weak and so and we see it also</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.419" end="00:26:55.789" style="s2">with cells cells skin cells for instance</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.110" end="00:26:58.220" style="s2">that are stressed with different things</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.789" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">they are actually healthier then skills</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.220" end="00:27:04.460" style="s2">skin cells that are unstressed because</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:06.440" style="s2">they grow weak from not having to resist</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.460" end="00:27:08.990" style="s2">these stress so I think this is an</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.440" end="00:27:11.510" style="s2">element that is can be easily overlooked</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.990" end="00:27:13.309" style="s2">when we are looking for paradise or some</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.510" end="00:27:17.270" style="s2">kind of ideal society that an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.309" end="00:27:19.490" style="s2">society only this utopia that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.270" end="00:27:20.690" style="s2">everybody&#39;s happening doesn&#39;t exist if</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.490" end="00:27:22.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t know if you remember the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.690" end="00:27:24.440" style="s2">Matrix movie you know they&#39;ve if the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.610" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">first generation of this matrix they</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.440" end="00:27:28.760" style="s2">maybe everybody was happy and they just</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:32.090" style="s2">went nuts so instead they created New</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.760" end="00:27:34.070" style="s2">York and this is quite a funny but but</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.090" end="00:27:35.870" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a layer of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.070" end="00:27:38.029" style="s2">wisdom to that you know give every</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.870" end="00:27:40.600" style="s2">people everyone what they desire and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.029" end="00:27:43.700" style="s2">they will all go nuts</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.600" end="00:27:46.429" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not so that&#39;s what anyone was</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.700" end="00:27:48.529" style="s2">saying but the the the notion of utopia</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.429" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">gets a lot of bad just going to come</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.529" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">into the defense of the notion of utopia</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">because I think it gets a lot of lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:57.559" style="s2">bad-mouthing and you know of course the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:27:59.539" style="s2">notion of utopia where everybody&#39;s happy</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.559" end="00:28:01.309" style="s2">all the time is absurd and naive I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.539" end="00:28:07.340" style="s2">disagreeing with that at all but having</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.309" end="00:28:09.350" style="s2">as an abstract notion be the always</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.340" end="00:28:11.390" style="s2">getting better right as a direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.350" end="00:28:12.950" style="s2">always heading in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.390" end="00:28:14.750" style="s2">figuring things out so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.950" end="00:28:18.409" style="s2">better and smoother and more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.750" end="00:28:20.149" style="s2">and more more inclusive and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.409" end="00:28:21.740" style="s2">on and so on right and heading in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.149" end="00:28:24.169" style="s2">direction knowing that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.740" end="00:28:26.179" style="s2">destination it&#39;s an attractor right that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.169" end="00:28:28.190" style="s2">if you think of utopia as an attractor</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.179" end="00:28:31.010" style="s2">and not as a destination then I think it</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.190" end="00:28:35.720" style="s2">has real value both in the psyche and as</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.010" end="00:28:37.309" style="s2">a driver for social development well so</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.720" end="00:28:38.630" style="s2">I don&#39;t you broke this is your first</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.309" end="00:28:40.429" style="s2">time at a solution Radian and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.630" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">mentioned this quite often but this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.429" end="00:28:45.919" style="s2">this conversation structure is designed</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:48.380" style="s2">very much in that utopia like that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.919" end="00:28:50.630" style="s2">don&#39;t have to disagree we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.380" end="00:28:53.389" style="s2">agree on what&#39;s wrong with AAA we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.630" end="00:28:55.220" style="s2">have to agree on our utopian versions of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.389" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">game B because they&#39;re different and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.220" end="00:28:58.060" style="s2">we&#39;re never arriving at</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:28:59.710" style="s2">that&#39;s why very much like what is your</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.060" end="00:29:01.630" style="s2">future and they don&#39;t need to match and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.710" end="00:29:04.360" style="s2">then the next section we&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.630" end="00:29:06.370" style="s2">move on to is what could we what is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.360" end="00:29:07.960" style="s2">step forward we could agree on and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.370" end="00:29:09.490" style="s2">don&#39;t even have to agree on that because</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.960" end="00:29:10.990" style="s2">it&#39;s just about getting 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.490" end="00:29:12.820" style="s2">together putting in ten dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.990" end="00:29:14.530" style="s2">creating 100,000 so you could have</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.820" end="00:29:17.560" style="s2">parallel ones right if one person wanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.530" end="00:29:19.540" style="s2">to create football club and one person</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.560" end="00:29:21.730" style="s2">wanted to create a golf club and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.540" end="00:29:22.870" style="s2">was what that was Center Brown that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.730" end="00:29:26.200" style="s2">would you know I mean it&#39;d be different</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.870" end="00:29:29.770" style="s2">ten thousand people and like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.200" end="00:29:32.590" style="s2">personally I&#39;m okay with my life being</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.770" end="00:29:34.900" style="s2">made super easy because I can because my</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.590" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">health challenges the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.900" end="00:29:38.770" style="s2">challenges societal challenges are more</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:41.080" style="s2">than enough challenge for me and so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.770" end="00:29:43.960" style="s2">think that it&#39;s an individual choice to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.080" end="00:29:46.210" style="s2">say what is the level like I was always</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.960" end="00:29:48.520" style="s2">like it&#39;s life needs to be simple and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.210" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">easy and fun and it&#39;s and Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.520" end="00:29:53.680" style="s2">pointed out what is his word I can never</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:55.930" style="s2">remember in the moment enjoyable which</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.680" end="00:29:57.570" style="s2">for me would be simple and easy and for</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.930" end="00:29:59.320" style="s2">someone else would be a challenge right</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.570" end="00:30:02.140" style="s2">enjoyable is different for different</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.320" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">people and having a challenge is part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.140" end="00:30:06.810" style="s2">it we hopefully mostly have stopped</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">trying to conquer each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.810" end="00:30:12.490" style="s2">nation-state way but we have sports</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:14.560" style="s2">right I don&#39;t play sports but like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.490" end="00:30:19.060" style="s2">rival ristmas on the field that people</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.560" end="00:30:20.890" style="s2">really enjoy is part of our what will we</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.060" end="00:30:23.260" style="s2">need people want to be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.890" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">so giving them the space to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.260" end="00:30:28.360" style="s2">you know transition to the next part</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:32.710" style="s2">which is what could we do to help people</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.360" end="00:30:36.010" style="s2">find more leisure more enjoyment out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.710" end="00:30:38.500" style="s2">their life in the existing roads with</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.010" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">10,000 people at $100,000 what could we</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.500" end="00:30:44.200" style="s2">create so that you have more leisure</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:47.920" style="s2">time or you have more access to hobbies</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.200" end="00:30:49.900" style="s2">in their leisure time well you know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.920" end="00:30:51.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working towards those avid a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.900" end="00:30:56.380" style="s2">craft pub idea where people could just</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.640" end="00:30:59.050" style="s2">come in and play with stuff and so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.380" end="00:31:01.270" style="s2">like if I add ten thousand people a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.050" end="00:31:03.700" style="s2">hundred thousand pounds that would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.270" end="00:31:05.770" style="s2">open rolling by now and it&#39;d be open and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.700" end="00:31:08.700" style="s2">everybody be be able to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.770" end="00:31:11.279" style="s2">there wouldn&#39;t be no barriers to entry</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.700" end="00:31:13.379" style="s2">and as I said that we stuff get made to</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:14.940" style="s2">be stuff growing out of that I got asked</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.379" end="00:31:17.249" style="s2">to write a day-in-the-life</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.940" end="00:31:18.869" style="s2">long as they were watched a job because</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.249" end="00:31:21.269" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a day-in-the-life about seven</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.869" end="00:31:23.809" style="s2">yeah just now about the be artists</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.970" end="00:32:19.559" style="s2">so the people who were part of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.100" end="00:32:21.659" style="s2">network will be able to see the pilot up</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.559" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">and running and stuff and obviously to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.659" end="00:32:25.769" style="s2">be stuff online and we could sort like</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.669" end="00:32:43.889" style="s2">sustainable turned into a sacred economy</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.399" end="00:32:46.019" style="s2">and it worked and then any money that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.889" end="00:32:49.649" style="s2">came back into that would go and help</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.480" end="00:33:35.800" style="s2">because if you want to hide a studio</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.490" end="00:33:37.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like 60 quid an hour sometimes and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.800" end="00:33:38.860" style="s2">if you you know just a budding</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.570" end="00:33:41.080" style="s2">photographer who doesn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.860" end="00:33:43.510" style="s2">professional there&#39;s nowhere to go so</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.080" end="00:33:46.180" style="s2">they&#39;ve to be able to do that and also</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.510" end="00:33:47.680" style="s2">films as well to be sort like film my</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.180" end="00:33:49.570" style="s2">cousin over loads of documentary</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.130" end="00:33:55.090" style="s2">made and there may be inspired other</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.900" end="00:33:56.950" style="s2">people to get involved because of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.090" end="00:33:58.870" style="s2">equipment there and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.950" end="00:34:01.240" style="s2">money would go for the equipment as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.870" end="00:34:06.100" style="s2">so so yeah I&#39;d be as up he&#39;s a pig and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.240" end="00:34:07.690" style="s2"> if I had that I think I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:34:07.690" end="00:34:10.630" style="s2">actually came up with something similar</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.980" end="00:34:14.409" style="s2">to that we were talking about having a</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.870" end="00:34:22.510" style="s2">the equipment and I think that having a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:25.090" style="s2">instead of a tool library which is good</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.510" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">if your hobby has involved power tools</p>

<p begin="00:35:39.510" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">so something like meet up but meet up</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.070" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">used to be free and now it&#39;s like 10</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:47.730" style="s2">bucks to start something which is too</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:49.320" style="s2">much of a barrier for some people and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.730" end="00:35:51.060" style="s2">then because of that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.320" end="00:35:53.100" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s not on there that could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.060" end="00:35:54.570" style="s2">and it&#39;s not or it&#39;s orchestrated some</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.100" end="00:35:57.390" style="s2">meetup makes money right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.570" end="00:36:00.770" style="s2">orchestrated so that the person involved</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.390" end="00:36:03.630" style="s2">has the best leisure time has the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.770" end="00:36:07.170" style="s2">happiness and so creating something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.630" end="00:36:10.170" style="s2">we wanted that is just coordinating the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.170" end="00:36:12.060" style="s2">individuals interests and space-like</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.170" end="00:36:14.010" style="s2">thing if you need a physical space to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.060" end="00:36:16.650" style="s2">your habían with other people right the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.010" end="00:36:19.350" style="s2">community the space and their resources</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.650" end="00:36:20.820" style="s2">so that you can try something new you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.350" end="00:36:23.700" style="s2">can offer your hobby to someone else you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.820" end="00:36:26.910" style="s2">can find people who want to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.700" end="00:36:28.050" style="s2">connected with things like that out the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.910" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">world like when I asked about the ten</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.050" end="00:36:33.030" style="s2">thousand how many people can one Cafe</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:34.980" style="s2">actually host not necessarily at a time</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.030" end="00:36:35.940" style="s2">but in a month right how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.980" end="00:36:37.740" style="s2">using it and then that would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.940" end="00:36:40.920" style="s2">information that would be available for</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.740" end="00:36:42.540" style="s2">the next franchisable like st. John yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.920" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">right to be like oh we want one in</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.540" end="00:36:45.840" style="s2">Newark okay but just starting one</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:47.910" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense do we have the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.840" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">threshold of people that make it viable</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.910" end="00:36:51.030" style="s2">right people who are willing to put in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:52.410" style="s2">50 bucks a month if they happen to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.030" end="00:36:53.820" style="s2">that money and no problem and other</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.410" end="00:36:55.590" style="s2">people who are like never gonna put any</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.820" end="00:36:57.390" style="s2">money because they can&#39;t even afford tea</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.590" end="00:37:00.090" style="s2">there and you know I mean like creating</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.390" end="00:37:03.120" style="s2">it for the diversity of people involved</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.090" end="00:37:07.110" style="s2">but openly and transparently yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.120" end="00:37:09.780" style="s2">Oh totally just think about what ralph</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.110" end="00:37:13.950" style="s2">was saying about how stressed cells are</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.780" end="00:37:15.720" style="s2">often more healthy than ones that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.950" end="00:37:17.340" style="s2">get a working out yeah I was just</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.720" end="00:37:18.690" style="s2">thinking my lung tissue must be super</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.340" end="00:37:24.390" style="s2">healthy all the smoking I&#39;ve done in my</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.690" end="00:37:27.870" style="s2">life you&#39;re mute is you&#39;re muted Ralph I</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.680" end="00:37:55.780" style="s2">yeah so well I think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.700" end="00:37:58.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a saying that it&#39;s never too</p>

<p begin="00:37:58.359" end="00:38:01.840" style="s2">think that this has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:04.300" style="s2">with the story we have about things and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.840" end="00:38:06.849" style="s2">to me I think about you know 80 90</p>

<p begin="00:38:06.849" end="00:38:09.670" style="s2">that makes happy lies in the people&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.670" end="00:38:14.830" style="s2">and there are some deep esoteric reasons</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.130" end="00:38:17.910" style="s2">that are related to the history of the</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.910" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">deep and difficult to go into but I find</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.280" end="00:38:28.119" style="s2">that you know oftentimes people they</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:31.150" style="s2">dream about one thing and if they get</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.119" end="00:38:34.540" style="s2">that they do something else because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.150" end="00:38:36.099" style="s2">the the belief that people have about</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.540" end="00:38:37.540" style="s2">what they want they do not align with</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.599" end="00:38:45.010" style="s2">I would like to put my creatives effort</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.820" end="00:38:46.930" style="s2">towards creating that which is actually</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.170" end="00:38:58.900" style="s2">opportunity if I had ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.619" end="00:39:01.690" style="s2">I would get them into groups of 1,000</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.900" end="00:39:06.609" style="s2">and built game be hubs in ten locations</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.690" end="00:39:09.560" style="s2">in the world and $100,000 wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.609" end="00:39:12.240" style="s2">we would need much more money than that</p>

<p begin="00:39:12.240" end="00:39:16.780" style="s2">maybe we could get a website going for</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.680" end="00:39:18.310" style="s2">the hundred thousand and outlined the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.780" end="00:39:21.250" style="s2">vision and see if we can attract some</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.250" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">ways the word is utopia you know if you</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:36.040" style="s2">to a way to really get a chance to to</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.310" end="00:39:45.250" style="s2">to do and you know it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.390" end="00:39:47.250" style="s2">interesting all the opportunities and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.250" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">are facing a massive shift so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.250" end="00:39:54.940" style="s2">whether a place is utopia or not it also</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:57.760" style="s2">very much depends on your perspective if</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.940" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">you love to raise solutions I think it</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">seemed this is utopia</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.730" end="00:40:07.500" style="s2">did you read those my hobby like I want</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.880" end="00:40:10.010" style="s2">more people to get into solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.500" end="00:40:10.010" style="s2">as a hobby</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.369" end="00:40:18.050" style="s2">Rolf did you read the article that Ronin</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.220" end="00:40:21.090" style="s2">linked yesterday I still have it open</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.050" end="00:40:22.440" style="s2">okay yes it&#39;s fairly long but it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.090" end="00:40:25.080" style="s2">it&#39;s quite readable as well written it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.080" end="00:40:29.130" style="s2">I mean I would much prefer to have ten</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.750" end="00:40:41.070" style="s2">million dollars and a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.130" end="00:40:43.740" style="s2">actually I have an idea for how we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.070" end="00:40:46.369" style="s2">raise a billions of dollars actually but</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.740" end="00:40:52.050" style="s2">it takes a group of very dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.369" end="00:40:55.410" style="s2">people intelligent and you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.050" end="00:40:57.690" style="s2">would really love is for some dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.410" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">people that were really you know stand</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.690" end="00:41:04.500" style="s2">shoulder to shoulder in a in an in a in</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:07.380" style="s2">a sort of spacious sense realizing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.500" end="00:41:09.540" style="s2">the grander purpose and and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.380" end="00:41:12.270" style="s2">getting getting out of our way in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.540" end="00:41:14.970" style="s2">sense that we all carry a lot of rules</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.270" end="00:41:17.310" style="s2">from our upbringing and it is really</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.970" end="00:41:21.080" style="s2">hard to shed that baggage and and and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.310" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">need to do deep work to do it to really</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.080" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">create something which not just a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:28.350" style="s2">replica of game a and and I am that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:30.630" style="s2">also why I&#39;m showing happy I&#39;m enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.350" end="00:41:35.090" style="s2">this community and I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.630" end="00:41:38.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of space for you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.090" end="00:41:41.250" style="s2">imagining and architecting new</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.220" end="00:41:43.650" style="s2">structures that could potentially make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.250" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">big difference and then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.650" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">this sort of a bit of a fluttering</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:49.530" style="s2">energy where you have people coming in</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.030" end="00:41:51.480" style="s2">with very personal lights in this I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.530" end="00:41:53.430" style="s2">I remember that growing up I was my</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.480" end="00:41:56.310" style="s2">parents they often hosted you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.430" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">groups where twenty people get together</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.310" end="00:42:00.570" style="s2">and and vision about the future and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.460" style="s2">would have all these fantastic visions</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.570" end="00:42:05.609" style="s2">and when it came down to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.460" end="00:42:07.619" style="s2">well everybody willing to act anybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.609" end="00:42:09.420" style="s2">willing to invest something in this even</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.619" end="00:42:11.430" style="s2">just a small amount like thousand</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.420" end="00:42:12.600" style="s2">dollars or something that most people</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.430" end="00:42:13.530" style="s2">were gone maybe there would be one or</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.600" end="00:42:16.140" style="s2">two left</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.530" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">and it just taught me that you know most</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.140" end="00:42:20.610" style="s2">people they come from a place where they</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:24.270" style="s2">just decide to talk they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.610" end="00:42:25.470" style="s2">interested in in in in creating and if</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.270" end="00:42:28.410" style="s2">you want to create something you have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.470" end="00:42:30.600" style="s2">find those one or two people and to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.410" end="00:42:33.720" style="s2">them together because they can make a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.600" end="00:42:35.130" style="s2">change and so that&#39;s my what I want I</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.720" end="00:42:37.140" style="s2">mean I would rather have hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.130" end="00:42:40.230" style="s2">in ten billion dollars we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.140" end="00:42:42.330" style="s2">have a little help make a make a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.230" end="00:42:44.130" style="s2">difference I&#39;d like to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.330" end="00:42:46.230" style="s2">maybe a thousand dollars is not a small</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.130" end="00:42:47.670" style="s2">amount of money thousand dollars put</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.230" end="00:42:48.780" style="s2">into something now if it was twenty</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.670" end="00:42:50.820" style="s2">thousand dollars into something to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.780" end="00:42:54.120" style="s2">create a community that I get to live in</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.110" end="00:44:25.380" style="s2">up in all kinds of stories that speak to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:27.120" style="s2">them and and really wanted really wanted</p>

<p begin="00:44:27.120" end="00:44:33.810" style="s2">honestly what is going on is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.710" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">what is happening it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.810" end="00:44:37.650" style="s2">because we&#39;re talking about leisure time</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:40.320" style="s2">and we&#39;ve switched over to talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.650" end="00:44:41.730" style="s2">game B but if we can create more leisure</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.320" end="00:44:45.060" style="s2">time for people right time that they</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.730" end="00:44:48.450" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be focused on making food</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.060" end="00:44:50.430" style="s2">or working to buy food like their when</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.350" end="00:44:55.470" style="s2">and they also have more time for</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.790" end="00:44:56.820" style="s2">personal growth if they choose to use it</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.470" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">for that right that is part of what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.820" end="00:45:00.060" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to do that when your</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.060" end="00:45:04.680" style="s2">whereas to be able to have any kind of</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.680" end="00:45:09.870" style="s2">you need to have some of those needs met</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.390" end="00:45:14.840" style="s2">and I do think that giving people access</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.870" end="00:45:17.370" style="s2">to things that bring them happiness</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.840" end="00:45:19.590" style="s2">bigger activities that bring them</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.370" end="00:45:21.750" style="s2">happiness that are actually resonating</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.730" end="00:46:42.630" style="s2">hobbies in those arenas what we could</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.900" end="00:46:44.339" style="s2">together to give people both just easier</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.630" end="00:46:46.200" style="s2">access in their free time</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.339" end="00:46:49.020" style="s2">the other solution raisins are about</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.200" end="00:46:50.309" style="s2">giving you more more time right bringing</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.020" end="00:46:52.470" style="s2">down your food needs or bringing down</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.309" end="00:46:54.059" style="s2">the cost of your food bringing down the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.470" end="00:46:57.710" style="s2">cost of energy so you can have more time</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.059" end="00:46:59.750" style="s2">to put into either leisure or</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.710" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve just had it I&#39;ve just had a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.750" end="00:47:04.099" style="s2">idea and this fits nicely with the scale</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">at ten thousand hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.099" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">as well so if you could round up ten</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:12.250" style="s2">thousand people each of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:14.780" style="s2">contributing $10 to the creation of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.250" end="00:47:17.150" style="s2">festival right where the ten thousand be</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.780" end="00:47:18.710" style="s2">and so then you find a piece of land</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.150" end="00:47:22.430" style="s2">somewhere and the ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.710" end="00:47:25.730" style="s2">all bring right tents and stalls</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.430" end="00:47:27.740" style="s2">and food and you know artwork and learn</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.730" end="00:47:30.349" style="s2">how to papier-mache and whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.740" end="00:47:33.020" style="s2">right and and then and for a weekend or</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.349" end="00:47:34.250" style="s2">a week or whatever it is I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.020" end="00:47:37.099" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.250" end="00:47:38.599" style="s2">reasonable amount of money given the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.099" end="00:47:40.099" style="s2">people going to be contributing a huge</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.599" end="00:47:41.210" style="s2">amount independently of that right</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.099" end="00:47:42.500" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be bringing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.210" end="00:47:44.900" style="s2">and their stuff independently about a</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.500" end="00:47:46.369" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars for the cleanup</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.900" end="00:47:48.290" style="s2">the infrastructure the rental of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.369" end="00:47:50.540" style="s2">land that kind of thing feels like ish</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.290" end="00:47:53.060" style="s2">the right kind of right kind of ballpark</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.540" end="00:47:55.130" style="s2">number so that could be that could be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.060" end="00:47:58.220" style="s2">really nice community building exercise</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.130" end="00:48:00.080" style="s2">and an opportunity people to involve</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.220" end="00:48:02.330" style="s2">other people in the ten thousand you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.080" end="00:48:04.190" style="s2">know what I mean like a tourist could</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.330" end="00:48:05.300" style="s2">get together and and come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.190" end="00:48:07.820" style="s2">kind of thing which they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.300" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">perform at the festival and and and all</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.820" end="00:48:12.320" style="s2">of those sorts of little linkages would</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:15.130" style="s2">form within the ten thousand in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.320" end="00:48:17.540" style="s2">pursuit of putting on this festival</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.130" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">you know a year hence something like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.540" end="00:48:26.180" style="s2">that I think that the greeting festival</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:28.070" style="s2">is a good idea enough need to be so big</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.180" end="00:48:29.869" style="s2">but I think one experience that I have</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.070" end="00:48:32.440" style="s2">from from you know things like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.869" end="00:48:35.210" style="s2">festivals and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.440" end="00:48:39.970" style="s2">KUSI&#39;s enough like eighty percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.210" end="00:48:42.680" style="s2">people or maybe ninety are singles and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.970" end="00:48:44.270" style="s2">they&#39;re really very usually looking for</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.680" end="00:48:45.890" style="s2">a mate rather than all this this</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.270" end="00:48:49.190" style="s2">creative stuff is like a sideshow to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.890" end="00:48:51.380" style="s2">their real agenda very often and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.190" end="00:48:52.700" style="s2">understandable but I&#39;m just saying in</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.380" end="00:48:54.410" style="s2">practice if you look at the motive</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.700" end="00:48:55.940" style="s2">they&#39;re not co-creators of the festival</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.410" end="00:49:00.440" style="s2">are they they paid their money to go to</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.940" end="00:49:03.530" style="s2">it they&#39;re not also co-creators you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.440" end="00:49:07.150" style="s2">like I&#39;m just pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.530" end="00:49:11.090" style="s2">this these creative endeavors are often</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.150" end="00:49:13.520" style="s2">sort of perpendicular sideshow to deepen</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.090" end="00:49:19.850" style="s2">eats which are related to connection to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.520" end="00:49:23.690" style="s2">love to feeling purpose and three and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.850" end="00:49:25.370" style="s2">sex and sex yeah actually what&#39;s to say</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.870" end="00:51:38.310" style="s2">just means you project even more onto</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.420" end="00:51:40.590" style="s2">this unknown person than you would do if</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.310" end="00:51:41.340" style="s2">you could see them is yeah oh god what a</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.590" end="00:51:42.840" style="s2">nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.340" end="00:51:45.960" style="s2">what a rude awakening you must be</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.840" end="00:51:48.330" style="s2">actually see and meet the actual person</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.960" end="00:51:49.830" style="s2">do you wonder how whether those</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.830" end="00:51:54.600" style="s2">because like my guess is they last</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.750" end="00:51:55.860" style="s2">better more than the swipe left right</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.600" end="00:51:57.750" style="s2">call tricks we&#39;re just like shopping</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.860" end="00:52:00.360" style="s2">like you don&#39;t look right in an instant</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.750" end="00:52:02.460" style="s2">so like no and I think over it is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.360" end="00:52:03.930" style="s2">what the actually designer is different</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.460" end="00:52:06.210" style="s2">than that because everyone complains</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.930" end="00:52:08.280" style="s2">about the current hookup culture but</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.210" end="00:52:10.320" style="s2">we&#39;re not designing things that are any</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.280" end="00:52:11.850" style="s2">different that are anyway we&#39;ll have it</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.320" end="00:52:13.620" style="s2">like I said will have its own solution</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.850" end="00:52:15.630" style="s2">raising we&#39;re getting down to the last</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.620" end="00:52:17.310" style="s2">few minutes usually this time we can go</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.630" end="00:52:19.890" style="s2">around that we have our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.310" end="00:52:21.540" style="s2">after that doesn&#39;t go around and talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.890" end="00:52:23.250" style="s2">about what you think is the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.540" end="00:52:25.410" style="s2">powerful thing we could do in the area</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.250" end="00:52:28.080" style="s2">of hobbies so leisure time enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.410" end="00:52:29.340" style="s2">that would be that we could do with</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.080" end="00:52:32.700" style="s2">10,000 people on hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.340" end="00:52:36.750" style="s2">dollars well I just say very few people</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.700" end="00:52:37.890" style="s2">you can do with so many people it</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.750" end="00:52:39.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you need to like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.890" end="00:52:41.580" style="s2">festival would be one that could happen</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.150" end="00:52:43.830" style="s2">right and a website it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.580" end="00:52:45.420" style="s2">how do we together get our leisure needs</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.830" end="00:52:46.530" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t mean 10,000 people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.420" end="00:52:49.560" style="s2">getting together and having a hobby</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.530" end="00:52:50.970" style="s2">themselves I thought actually one thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.560" end="00:52:54.390" style="s2">that would be really cool would be make</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.970" end="00:52:56.280" style="s2">a like a big game be Facebook kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.390" end="00:52:58.260" style="s2">thing or it&#39;s like a social media that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.280" end="00:53:01.910" style="s2">would be tailored to the game be</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.260" end="00:53:05.010" style="s2">audience and that might be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.910" end="00:53:12.780" style="s2">if you could get get some some</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.010" end="00:53:14.340" style="s2">knowledgeable tech people behind it on</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.780" end="00:53:17.330" style="s2">that case as well you would deal with</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.340" end="00:53:20.220" style="s2">the tech with the secretary that case</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.330" end="00:53:22.680" style="s2">yeah theoretically something will emerge</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.220" end="00:53:27.270" style="s2">we&#39;re not necess and everyone&#39;s focused</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.680" end="00:53:28.740" style="s2">on yes that problem social baby way but</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.270" end="00:53:30.230" style="s2">how do we actually create it without all</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.740" end="00:53:32.119" style="s2">the risk</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.230" end="00:53:33.859" style="s2">that is what solution raising there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.119" end="00:53:35.840" style="s2">little people out there another working</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.859" end="00:53:39.950" style="s2">on exactly that problem I feel it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.840" end="00:53:41.900" style="s2">mine to do that one I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.950" end="00:53:46.850" style="s2">powerful thing I would like to see for</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.900" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 is a free</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.850" end="00:53:49.670" style="s2">Meetup</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:51.650" style="s2">but more for both online and offline</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.670" end="00:53:53.180" style="s2">meetup also doesn&#39;t focus on online and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.650" end="00:53:54.200" style="s2">now that everyone&#39;s on zoom&#39; it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.180" end="00:53:56.030" style="s2">of weird because you&#39;re like in</p>

<p begin="00:53:56.030" end="00:54:00.460" style="s2">well then why do I need you to be in</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.080" end="00:54:04.250" style="s2">Vancouver like having it be just a</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.460" end="00:54:06.680" style="s2">coordination of my time my interests</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.250" end="00:54:10.100" style="s2">with people and space and resources that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.680" end="00:54:11.810" style="s2">we need and then a dashboard of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.100" end="00:54:14.840" style="s2">up to in the week and in the month and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.810" end="00:54:17.330" style="s2">what do I want to add so that I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.840" end="00:54:23.630" style="s2">more leisure not more leisure time at</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.330" end="00:54:24.650" style="s2">more happiness in my leisure time well</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.630" end="00:54:26.360" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that is really free</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.650" end="00:54:29.860" style="s2">because we invest our time and our time</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.360" end="00:54:34.220" style="s2">is valuable as well so yeah I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.860" end="00:54:36.530" style="s2">is not what you know you know oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.220" end="00:54:38.750" style="s2">I prefer paying a little bit for</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.530" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">something knowing that I will waste less</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.750" end="00:54:42.380" style="s2">time here because it&#39;s well thought out</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:44.210" style="s2">rather than having something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.380" end="00:54:46.550" style="s2">apparently for free but I waste over</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.210" end="00:54:50.780" style="s2">time because it&#39;s it&#39;s fully thought-out</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.550" end="00:54:53.120" style="s2">or to Apple content or whatever I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.780" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">want a horrible for a meet-up type thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.120" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t it has to be as good as meetup or</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:54:59.780" style="s2">I&#39;m not using it right in hosta and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:01.730" style="s2">that&#39;s part of putting in money you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.780" end="00:55:03.860" style="s2">putting in $10 so we have access to this</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.730" end="00:55:04.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not free free but then we could</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.860" end="00:55:06.710" style="s2">offer it to the rest of the world for</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.970" end="00:55:09.050" style="s2">free so they can come on and find people</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.710" end="00:55:10.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s all new in or enter</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.050" end="00:55:12.440" style="s2">brotherís the more people are involved</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.430" end="00:55:14.150" style="s2">in that site the better right the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.440" end="00:55:16.490" style="s2">ideas and more connections the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.150" end="00:55:18.170" style="s2">resources there are so you want more</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.490" end="00:55:21.770" style="s2">people to come on board you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.170" end="00:55:24.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not free but it&#39;s um we can price</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.770" end="00:55:26.630" style="s2">it at the point where it&#39;s break-even</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.680" end="00:55:29.240" style="s2">not at the point where meetups making</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.630" end="00:55:30.560" style="s2">money not at the point where and we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.240" end="00:55:32.600" style="s2">figure out who pays for it and who</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.560" end="00:55:34.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t so what is the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.600" end="00:55:39.380" style="s2">making money I mean I you know if</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.430" end="00:55:42.470" style="s2">something doesn&#39;t make money it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.380" end="00:55:45.800" style="s2">unhealthy I think I mean like any any</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.470" end="00:55:49.160" style="s2">and you know in nature things are the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.800" end="00:55:50.450" style="s2">grow or they decay and if they grow that</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.160" end="00:55:54.260" style="s2">means they&#39;re having a profit you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.450" end="00:55:57.320" style="s2">they are managing to sub or suck up</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.260" end="00:56:01.400" style="s2">resources and grow and I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.320" end="00:56:03.470" style="s2">that that holding up as an ideal or good</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.400" end="00:56:07.610" style="s2">thing that things doesn&#39;t make a profit</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.470" end="00:56:09.890" style="s2">I think it&#39;s is unnatural it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.610" end="00:56:11.210" style="s2">a misunderstanding just because the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.890" end="00:56:13.220" style="s2">principle of profit has been</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.210" end="00:56:19.750" style="s2">misappropriated and abuse doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.220" end="00:56:23.030" style="s2">that it is in itself unsound but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.750" end="00:56:25.250" style="s2">meetups vision their purpose is to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.030" end="00:56:27.710" style="s2">money not to make my life better so that</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.250" end="00:56:29.330" style="s2">is a very different goal than having us</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.710" end="00:56:30.950" style="s2">have the purpose of it having more</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.330" end="00:56:32.780" style="s2">leisure time and what how much money do</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.950" end="00:56:34.400" style="s2">we need to do that and yes we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.780" end="00:56:36.260" style="s2">put money in so it&#39;s good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:37.460" style="s2">different there are different goals and</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.260" end="00:56:39.830" style="s2">so it&#39;s just under</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.460" end="00:56:41.570" style="s2">when all the corporations main purpose</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.830" end="00:56:42.800" style="s2">is for profit we can&#39;t trust them to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.570" end="00:56:45.109" style="s2">it they&#39;re there to do which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.800" end="00:56:46.820" style="s2">healthcare transportation anything else</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.109" end="00:56:48.859" style="s2">because they&#39;re there first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.820" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">to make money not to make my life better</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.859" end="00:56:52.550" style="s2">they&#39;re only making my life better in as</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:54.200" style="s2">much as they&#39;re making profit and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.550" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">would like that to be switched not turn</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.200" end="00:56:59.180" style="s2">not completely no profit everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:01.640" style="s2">utopian everything&#39;s free completely but</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.180" end="00:57:04.130" style="s2">if we have our purpose as the mission</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.640" end="00:57:06.170" style="s2">right in this case hobbies in connection</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.130" end="00:57:07.700" style="s2">and bring more leisure time that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.170" end="00:57:09.890" style="s2">be a completely different focus you</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.700" end="00:57:13.000" style="s2">can&#39;t ignore money and not have any of</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.890" end="00:57:17.330" style="s2">it but focusing on the purpose gives you</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.000" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">just more power together I think to an</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.330" end="00:57:21.050" style="s2">extent this is also an American thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:22.280" style="s2">you know I mean I mean in in in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.050" end="00:57:23.690" style="s2">and then Michael particularly you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.280" end="00:57:26.349" style="s2">we have a lot of inches we&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.690" end="00:57:28.790" style="s2">money is not the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.349" end="00:57:30.740" style="s2">you need to make money to have a sound</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.790" end="00:57:32.390" style="s2">business but people don&#39;t do it to make</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.740" end="00:57:35.480" style="s2">money I know a lot of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.390" end="00:57:37.369" style="s2">businesses because they love to give a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.480" end="00:57:39.349" style="s2">good service they love have happy</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.369" end="00:57:41.869" style="s2">clients they&#39;re focused on delivering</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.349" end="00:57:44.810" style="s2">value and earning money those two things</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.869" end="00:57:47.210" style="s2">do not exclude each other I think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.810" end="00:57:49.099" style="s2">in America you have sometimes a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.210" end="00:57:51.080" style="s2">to have a very harsh system over there</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.099" end="00:57:54.190" style="s2">and very little solidarity and very</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.080" end="00:57:57.410" style="s2">little safety net and so the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.190" end="00:58:00.109" style="s2">the polarities they gave very hard over</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.410" end="00:58:02.330" style="s2">in America often you the contrast is</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.109" end="00:58:04.849" style="s2">very hard but I think there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.330" end="00:58:17.690" style="s2">byproduct of your system more than aids</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.849" end="00:58:20.540" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a scale I think it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.690" end="00:58:24.500" style="s2">when organizations reach a certain size</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.540" end="00:58:26.540" style="s2">and that you know the the day to day</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.500" end="00:58:28.520" style="s2">minute-to-minute communication exchange</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.540" end="00:58:31.130" style="s2">of ideas that goes on within the core</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.520" end="00:58:33.020" style="s2">team of people once that breaks apart</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.130" end="00:58:35.000" style="s2">because the organization I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.020" end="00:58:37.099" style="s2">that&#39;s the point at which the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.000" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">the accountants the share price all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.099" end="00:58:44.270" style="s2">this kind of stuff starts to take over</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:46.220" style="s2">and and and the the earnest pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.270" end="00:58:47.880" style="s2">doing whatever it is you were doing as</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.220" end="00:58:50.490" style="s2">well as you could and making it make</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.880" end="00:58:52.769" style="s2">good living doing so that somehow gets</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.490" end="00:58:54.119" style="s2">lost at some point and I and I do think</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.769" end="00:58:55.769" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of scale and I do think</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.119" end="00:58:58.920" style="s2">it&#39;s almost inevitable because as you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.769" end="00:59:01.619" style="s2">get larger if you don&#39;t in if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.920" end="00:59:03.059" style="s2">follow these accounting and business and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.619" end="00:59:04.650" style="s2">financial practices then you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.059" end="00:59:05.789" style="s2">swallowed up by the big boys who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.650" end="00:59:07.859" style="s2">doing that you know what I mean and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.789" end="00:59:09.750" style="s2">you you kind of are thought once you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.859" end="00:59:13.230" style="s2">reach a certain size you&#39;re forced into</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.750" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">that game and certain size you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.230" end="00:59:18.869" style="s2">play that gaming I think this is really</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:20.609" style="s2">really interesting if because this also</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.869" end="00:59:22.200" style="s2">points to a solution to a totally</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.609" end="00:59:24.210" style="s2">different problem which might be</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.200" end="00:59:27.990" style="s2">breaking things up in smaller units by</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.210" end="00:59:29.009" style="s2">law and and indirectly generating a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.990" end="00:59:32.279" style="s2">of good because I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.009" end="00:59:34.200" style="s2">very big countries they tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.279" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">immersed in certain power dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.200" end="00:59:38.880" style="s2">are definitely not healthy which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:42.599" style="s2">like for other reasons but we can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.880" end="00:59:45.180" style="s2">into that because of breaking things up</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.599" end="00:59:46.890" style="s2">just to break them up when I&#39;m like what</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.180" end="00:59:48.329" style="s2">the socialist monopoly but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.890" end="00:59:52.200" style="s2">whole that&#39;s just my viewpoint doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.329" end="00:59:54.029" style="s2">in that story having um having so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.200" end="00:59:55.440" style="s2">carrying if you shared what you think is</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.029" end="00:59:56.700" style="s2">the most powerful thing we could do with</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.440" end="00:59:59.400" style="s2">I mean I know you did the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.700" end="01:00:00.779" style="s2">but at the end 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.400" end="01:00:03.299" style="s2">$100,000 what do you think is the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.779" end="01:00:05.460" style="s2">powerful well our board as you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.299" end="01:00:07.259" style="s2">doing it would have the ten thousand so</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.460" end="01:00:10.349" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen and things</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.259" end="01:00:13.710" style="s2">have started form into place so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.349" end="01:00:16.920" style="s2">really excited and if it comes across</p>
