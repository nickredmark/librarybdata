<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:40.719" style="s2">because i&#39;ve actually been focused on</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.440" end="00:00:59.840" style="s2">working on the prostate event book and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:01.600" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.840" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like certain chris and i are going</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.600" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">to release a book after we have turned</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">60 years old and the plan this time is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">to release our sixth book</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">like you know the tour de force the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:13.360" style="s2">magnum opus whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">and put our entire philosophy into one</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.360" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:17.360" style="s2">but this is also of course that this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:19.360" style="s2">the story of all stories this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.360" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">meta narrative itself that we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">to write</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:24.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s why why the book is called</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:24.640" style="s2">process and event we&#39;re always dealing</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.159" end="00:01:26.479" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.640" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">nomidology which is process over dealing</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.479" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">with eventology which is event</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">all major stories all major narratives</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">including all religions</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">all theologies all philosophies are</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:38.000" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.119" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">about process or about event so so does</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.000" end="00:01:41.920" style="s2">it work</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">and and i&#39;m i&#39;m working on um a specific</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">um concept here called the an object</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">and and i&#39;d love to discuss this this</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">concept with you guys because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">actually ties in quite nicely</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">to what we talked about before and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of is it related to your</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:02:00.079" style="s2">concept of the abject</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">is it yes it is but it&#39;s the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.079" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">the object</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like nobody&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">looking for it it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:08.239" style="s2">we also talked about how could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">save christianity or or</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.239" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">turn christianity or reinterpret</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">christianity afterwards it&#39;s a mature</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">faith to belong to the major faiths of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:18.800" style="s2">buddhisms or astralism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">and judaism and i think this could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">key</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">and i&#39;d love to have your input on it</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">because it certainly ties into gerard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">so i want to start by emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">something i find in heidegger but i</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily find it in gerard but</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">i might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s when heidegger is so damn upset</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">about the german term dasman it exists</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">in scandinavian languages in the german</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really exist in english</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">the positioning is when you say one</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:49.120" style="s2">rather than you</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">so one thinks about one says or</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.120" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">one behaves or one admits or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">rather than i admit or you admit</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">so but there&#39;s something very derogatory</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">about the german</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">term does man because it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">escaping responsibility it&#39;s hiding from</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">view it&#39;s sort of pulling itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">in and this is of course what lynch mobs</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">do today</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">so the lynn small people will not</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">publish their name in public they will</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">not publish their face in public they</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">it&#39;s the next thing is going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">is the lynch mobs will have their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">lynch mobs that go after them by</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">publishing their names and their</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">pictures</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">they don&#39;t realize that yet but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:24.879" style="s2">when it&#39;s going to get really messy</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.879" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">but when you&#39;re in the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">you assume that all of you in the lens</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">mob have a shared voice</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">you you blame somebody else for for</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:38.799" style="s2">being the leader you you said somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">else is supposed to be the voice in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.799" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">we all know from objection theory this</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">of course very girard</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">this is julia christena it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.920" end="00:03:48.879" style="s2">the psychiatrists have talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">the police mob is united</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">we know that a lynch mob can only get</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">unified through an object and actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the easiest way in the world</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">by finding something to hate</p>

<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">it&#39;s ghost-like but it&#39;s also supposed</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">to be superior to all other opinions</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">so for example in marxist critique of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">the bourgeoisie it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">the bush i think they&#39;re superior to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">rest of the people they think they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">or in our case today our problem is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">racism or sexism our problem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">generationism</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">our problem is the myth that we are</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">have died</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">so therefore we could think higher of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">ourselves because we&#39;re smarter than</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:46.639" style="s2">they are or no better they do</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s ridiculous it&#39;s exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.639" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">we&#39;re actually</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">where we take the blame from</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">this is the voice of the accuser</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s always an anonymous voice</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">because one it doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">two it&#39;s only being assumed three we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">and four if we&#39;re held accountable for</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.639" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">so in christian theology this would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">like blaming the jews for</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">killing christ when reality all humanity</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">killed</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:18.880" style="s2">christ the whole point was that even his</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">even his followers deserted him</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.880" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">yeah nobody stood behind you the point</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">with that story is to tell us that no we</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">all scapegoated him we all turn him into</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">the ability</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why anti-semitism in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s the jews killed</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">our our messiah is the absolute lie this</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">ridiculous lie</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">that&#39;s always really ironic yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s an anojector this is an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">the anarchic is of course the good</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">christian who blames the evil jew</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">you see how the anoject is necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">to to come</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">to to fill the entire jigsaw the entire</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">apostle</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">and that opens up a whole new space for</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">understanding the messiah figure</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">and for understanding the difference</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">between the messiah figure and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">it is what i&#39;ve been lacking i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">looking for years</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">because we all know from zoroastrianism</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">that the phallus has to be split</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">we know the egyptians experimented with</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">uniting</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">the phallus this is not and this led to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">atonism this is the origin</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">of the jewish religion and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">perfectly fine that&#39;s what you do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">something where you go through something</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s how the jews invented a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:28.000" style="s2">system where they avoid</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">dictatorship within the religion whereas</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.000" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">egyptians went for the dictatorship the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">egyptians invented the dictatorship of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">mimicking the persons and getting it all</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s why they invented the sun god</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">as the only god</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">but the problem is that monotheism has</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">to be split at the center</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">the phallus has to be split the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">chieftain and the priest must never be</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">the same person</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">this is what the persians understood and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">this was sore astronomism</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">provided us with a religion that held</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">the persian empire together for 1400</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">uniquely in history we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">empire theory today we have to start</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">with the persons we have to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">persons</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">so but the thing is that if you split</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">the phallus the trick is then</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">when this ocean derives it&#39;s a rasterian</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">mythology</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">when the messiah arrives in judaism when</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">the savior arrives in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">when the mod arrives from islam the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">crystals or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">yeah he always has the character of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">tyrant because he unifies the chieftain</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">and the priesthood into the same person</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">now what i did then was that i started</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">to thinking in a white hedian manner</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">and in whitehead the only thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">interesting is the relation</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">that was why zoroaster and whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">work so perfectly well together because</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">erastus says</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">the phallus is split and in hegelian</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">white tedion manner that means</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">that is the only phallus possible</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">because the phallus must be a relation</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">so sexually that is false inside matrix</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a fuck</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">but if you lead if you if you take on</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">the phallic leadership the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">leadership if you lead if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">patriarch</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">the patriarchy has to be split between</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">the chief</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">and the priest fundamentally possible to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">the match art</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">and by splitting the phallus we can lead</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">because we separate body from mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">so we have an expert in mind the priest</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">we have an expert of body who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">chieftain</p>

<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">vistaspa realized that because there</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">were two</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">they are really the uber match</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s mistake is to make the uber</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">when a reality the uberman should be in</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">because everything is relations hegel</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">and white are adamant about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">everything is about relations</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">it&#39;s radical relationalism so the</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">must then see the source to figure this</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">out be a relation</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s why persons are some</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">comfortable muslims and christians and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">jews</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">come to the suras and said yeah you</p>

<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">messiah we</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">got the idea from you we are new for</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">that and they go no you misinterpreted</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">because you took the egyptian version of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">it you killed the rain god to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">sound good only whereas we always said</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">you must keep the rain god and the sun</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">god together</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">because it is the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:20.860" style="s2">the rain god and the sun god</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">that is god</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">okay now that&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.440" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">the jews have this idea about the you</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">know the god having uh a dark side and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">the light side as well not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">there&#39;s like a dark god and a light god</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">as well oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">bit similar to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">oh there&#39;s so many of these i think once</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">you start splitting you should keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">splitting you should be spinosis to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">the universe is one</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:45.519" style="s2">everything else is an infinite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">attributes you&#39;re allowed to split as</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">much as you like</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">and the way we men look at it is by</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">learning that the chieftain</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">and the priest must be separate we learn</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">that we are separate we learn that with</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:55.760" style="s2">different types of men</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">we learn to admire other men for having</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.760" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">strengths that we don&#39;t have that is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">beginning of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why competition can only</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:05.200" style="s2">come out of an individualist mindset</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">that&#39;s completely misunderstood what it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.200" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">and be masculine because everything is</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">about relations now</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">but what&#39;s interesting here is that i</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">want to avoid making the associate into</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">the tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">because for me the tyrant is the false</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">phallus</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">who only appears in history where we</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">have lynch mobs like today</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">and somebody steps up and says we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:32.000" style="s2">an abject here to hate that we unify</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:33.200" style="s2">together with and this character must be</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.000" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">different from the session</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.200" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">or the messiah who&#39;s the savior because</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">otherwise adolf hitler would have been a</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">obviously he wasn&#39;t we call this</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">authentic follow some fake</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">and fake phallus in this liberal but i</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">want to explore deeper</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">and rather than asking where the cell</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">is the optimal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">between a king and a priest where</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what zoroaster means it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:11.519" style="s2">to run an empire successfully so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">question is where does the tyrant come</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.519" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">and this is the trick the tyrant is the</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">personified so while we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">our name out there no one ever</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.519" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">and we&#39;re safe and comfortable and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">can love to hate which is exactly</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">basically preparing for the next hitler</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">or the next on and that&#39;s exactly what</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">made that mistake right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">there must be something in his</p>

<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting question this</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">is where you guys come in because i want</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">to dress tonight i want to address the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">difference between heidegger and</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">and he goes to harwood and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">he stays away from europe and europe</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">goes to work whereas heidegger stays in</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">and he placed around with the nazi party</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">turns against him too because they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.639" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">use him much in the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:20.320" style="s2">but but it&#39;s interesting that that this</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">is so close to whitehead and it comes</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">yeah well gerard would say that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">probably that the bourgeois also becomes</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">another scapegoat it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">and the modernity like marx makes uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">the bourgeois scapegoat and um no i</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">freud makes the father why would you why</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">would gerard say when did</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">when did gerard defend the middle</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">classes ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">when did he defend the middle class no</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">he what he said is he wants to reject</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">the the three scapegoats of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">and he says marx freud and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">and uh what was the third was the third</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">nietzsche anita right he wants to reject</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">the the you know nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">would make the you know the christian</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">the scapegoat and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">um oh i think he&#39;s dead wrong marks</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">would make the bourgeois escape</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">anyway those three people yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">gerard is dead wrong on that nature does</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">read christ as something he wants to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">over or he&#39;s attacking the christian</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not at all what he does when when</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">he&#39;s regretting that god is dead and we</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">killed him</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">he means it in a very serious way this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">is where jordan peterson gets it right</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">and if gerard is wrong on that then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">wrong now</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">the christian is not turning to</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">scapegoat by anybody i haven&#39;t seen that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">at all i don&#39;t think christianity</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">christianity does like thomas has said</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">before christianity</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">always defends us he he he wants</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">christianity is the priest who wants us</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">to get out of the scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">so okay in a sore estrogen way</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">explaining christianity</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">this is how we describe it if the cell</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">is split that&#39;s wonderful because then</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">we can be saved at two different</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">instances the first is the chieftain</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">savior</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.640" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">he&#39;s the one who arrives us and fights</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">fights down the tyrant and the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">and saves us in the military manner</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:39.760" style="s2">okay that&#39;s the messiah but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">another messiah in case</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.760" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">the first messiah does not appear the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">second messiah comes along and placed</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">and then the priest can forever remind</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">us afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">that this is what happens if you kill</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">the messiah</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">so we can avoid tyranny and avoid</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">you see what i mean you&#39;re being more</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">sympathetic to christianity than usual</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">this time yes because no i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">thomas has been at me a lot about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">the point is that i had to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">say but the beauty of zoroastrianism is</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">destruction</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">but since the sorasus are frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">with the vulgarization of the social</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">why don&#39;t we take the social concept</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">seriously and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what the christians really tried</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:27.520" style="s2">and in that case they saw sean here the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">savior</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.520" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">who was on the cross is the savior who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">there for the priests</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">who then you know do not have children</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">and go into</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">a complete devotion to preaching the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">message of what happens if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">let&#39;s avoid that ever happening again</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">if the first messiah succeeds which of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">course christ wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">the first messiah is the ultimate hero</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">fights down the dragon and kills the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">dragon</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">and the dragon in that case is turning</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:02.480" style="s2">it is the an object it is the tyrant and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">his lunch model</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.480" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">and in that sense what we tried at least</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">to portray the amer</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:09.279" style="s2">that america did in europe when they</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">fought down hitler um</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.279" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">and eventually we got rid of stalinism</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">we&#39;re still fighting maoism when we were</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">fighting these incidents we fighted</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">these dictatorships i&#39;m personally</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">involved in trying to fight</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">the chinese dictatorship at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">by working with taiwanese hackers</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">it&#39;s one of my favorite preoccupations</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">now that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">of course hero fighting dragon but when</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">hero fights dragon in messianic sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">that is the first messiah</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">but to the persians both could exist</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">well that&#39;s very interesting yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">either jesus would be the second messiah</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.200" style="s2">yes in that theory yeah that&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">a wild theory</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.200" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">yeah yeah the the problem is that so</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">so with respect to this uh so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">significance of jesus right so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">atonement so basically why</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">why why did did god send jesus to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">earth right</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">and um so so there there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">uh there are three views on that right</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">and the first one is well</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">god sent jesus to the to the to to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">world so that he could die for our sins</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">that&#39;s the one in my opinion that makes</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">the least sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">yeah and then there&#39;s the second one and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:18.559" style="s2">uh well jesus is a moral example so an</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">example to follow now that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.559" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">valuable i think but it&#39;s still a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">problematic because i mean jesus ended</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">up on the cross right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">so this is kind of difficult to use also</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">there&#39;s some some</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:32.399" style="s2">censored parts of jesus life that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">know that come out in these weird texts</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.399" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">where he does all kinds of wild things</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">like kill somebody when he was young</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s just uh yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">but yeah but that um maybe unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">did not survive in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">in the bible we have now right so um and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">but then there&#39;s the third uh the third</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">explanation and this is the christus</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:55.679" style="s2">victor explanation where basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">um that uh jesus is did not die for our</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.679" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">sins or</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">and and he&#39;s not a moral example to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">follow as such but he reveals</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">the the the the victimized mechanism so</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">the mechanism of speech of scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">so and and that&#39;s basically uh so if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">look at christianity from that sentence</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">and basically christianity is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">is the ultimate anti-mob religion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">because the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">about christianity done well right</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">because of course there are many many</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">interpretations and you can twist this</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.799" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">any way you want right but but the value</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">in christianity lies in</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">look at what happened to jesus i mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">the jews didn&#39;t even kill him</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">and kill jesus themselves right they had</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">to ask their their sworn enemies the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">romans to do it for them</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s really the story of a human</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">being that was completely dehumanized</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">and killed and found guilty by everybody</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">and that christianity says that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">the devil essentially that mechanism is</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">the devil so what we&#39;re seeing right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">for from that christian point of view</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">right what you&#39;re actually seeing out</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">all these mobs that&#39;s the manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">of the devil and the devil is not so</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">something you know some</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">uh some entity out there it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">a mechanism that humans do and they do</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">that if they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">a a religion that keeps them from doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">that well could you say that an object</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">is the devil or like the satanic</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">principle or something something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">that so the an object would be the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">the justification of the mechanism it</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">would be a story that is told to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">justify the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">yeah because because because you you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">legitimate something with history so</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">priests legitimate anything and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">and the chieftain justifies it by</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">looking into the future legitimation is</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">what you do with history</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">justification we do in the future so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">energetic takes on these roles he steals</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">every role that any priesthood chieftain</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">could do and then becomes the time of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">pretending to be both</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">i completely agree with thomas on this</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">strongly</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no point in reading christianity</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.120" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">any other way you read the gospels it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:47.679" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">there there&#39;s no room for these first</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.679" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">two interpretations they made up</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">afterwards in a sort of bourgeois way</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">making christ in some kind of role model</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">think you could mimic</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">no never does christ usually mimic me no</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">he does not say that anywhere so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">coming around i think to to seeing</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:07.360" style="s2">christ as a crazy wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">no no no no i&#39;m not that&#39;s because no</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.360" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">rather no i&#39;m look take christianity</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">read your art seriously read the gospel</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">and believe me i&#39;ve done that no it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">a trinity that exposes it all there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">room for the trinity in the first</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">interpretation of why christ was around</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no room for him as the moral</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">example at all</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">but that moral example is like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">like you know a traditional chinese</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">indian guru walking around you try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">mimicking</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">well that&#39;s only sutra anyways it</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get you that far so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">banal religion worst case religion right</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">no it is the third one we need to go to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">christ on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">to christians everywhere is the event</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">christianity is an evantology the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:54.399" style="s2">concept of the eventuality was invented</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">by zoroaster it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.399" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">major religious innovation ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">outside of eventology we only have</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">nominology we only have the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">recurrence of the same we only get mad</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">turkey wins at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">you know we only have everything goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">around round without ever</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">ever anything changing evan told this</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">that something profound can happen in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">history to change history forever</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s zoroaster&#39;s fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">contribution and it&#39;s the only real</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">radical break that&#39;s what it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">it moves from zoroaster to to judaism</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:31.360" style="s2">yeah logical the ethnological</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">eventology is it&#39;s definitely goes west</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:35.360" style="s2">eventology is zoroastrianism</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">so racism stays in dollar with taoism</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.360" end="00:31:38.559" style="s2">buddhism which is the known mythological</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">part of it so astonish so</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.559" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">i always thought religion should be both</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">i&#39;m more surprised than ever</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">but the eventology was then cleansed</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">from nominology and which should have</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">been a priestly religion</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">in egypt was developed into a mass</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">religion the probably always having</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">monotheism as a master that didn&#39;t is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">doesn&#39;t gel with people because people</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:31:58.799" style="s2">are polytheistic fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">politicism is religion bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.799" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">monotheism monotheistic misreligion top</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">down so monotheism in the egyptian sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">which is pure dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:10.640" style="s2">so they took modernism and everything is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">united and affects everything else to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.640" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">that everything is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">when reality like spinoza said no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">a complete mistake</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:19.519" style="s2">monism is just the unity of everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">that everything affects everything else</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.519" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">but actually the world is split into an</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">immense multiplicity of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:26.799" style="s2">that has an infinite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">attributes this would take spin also</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.799" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">now soreaster is the original spinosis</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">so this is true this is a trainer</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">thought all the way for zoroastrospinosa</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">but spinoza lacks or rasters pathos</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:39.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you see them popping up</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">that could be used in christianity in</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.600" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">islam and certainly in judaism</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">and they deal with the pathos of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:48.159" style="s2">logos of the mythos and the jews</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">solve it by taking the story of moses</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.159" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">an egyptian and leading an egyptian sect</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">out of that&#39;s when they were the jews</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:56.640" style="s2">and became the hebrews</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">when they came to the promised land and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">started mixing with the canaanites</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">and eventually three different gods</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:07.039" style="s2">actually were turned into one</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">adonai in hebrew is atom</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">in egypt it&#39;s the same god you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">like freud said it&#39;s obviously that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">atonists became the adonai worshipers so</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what i have noticed the holy name</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">of all names for god in the jewish bible</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">so but adonai then</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">they added the volcano god which is of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">course the rain god they needed to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">re-add</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">rain god that was slacking it took a</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:28.159" style="s2">volcano god because the other day it</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">says smaller dear weather doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.159" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">but when the earth shakes and you you</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">you&#39;re under the powers of nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">you need a volcano jave which then</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">became judea</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">and then they took elohim which is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">name for israel that became the kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">of israel</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">so elohim was the worship of one god and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">and the worship of java was judea and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">they were united through adonai</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">and they were later merged into a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">trinity</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">this is the jewish trinity</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">in zoroastrianism it was simply it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">the priest</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">and the chieftain and the matriarch</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">so when the jews then wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">reinterpret the human story which is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:08.720" style="s2">exodus alleged they couldn&#39;t use three</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">gods that led the people out of egypt</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.720" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">they took three siblings and they gave</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:14.879" style="s2">moses</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">the egyptian prince a sibling called</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">aaron and aaron and moses changed the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">roles of chieftain and a priest in</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">between but there were</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">always two that means the jewish</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">pharisees always split between the two</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:26.480" style="s2">brothers</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.560" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">and and then they added miriam the older</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.480" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">sister who is the matriarch pushing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">entire people before her for 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">into the promised land and then moses</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">dies before they enter the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">as the priests you do</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">the chieftain leads the people into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:40.960" style="s2">promised land and this becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">mythology the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">and to any jew you talk to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">absolutely central there are three</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">siblings to the story</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">this so you&#39;re relating the three</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">siblings to or this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">is in trinity okay the original exodus</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">out of age according to freud</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">was only moses and then he mistook it</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">for their two different moses</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">no there&#39;s moses aaron and miriam in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">later story and that story came out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">babylon with persian influence</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:07.280" style="s2">so what the jews basically did they were</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">an egyptian sect monotheistic sect that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.280" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">the persians</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">loved because the persians practiced</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">their own form of monotheism with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">split phallus</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">so you said that&#39;s brilliant by</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">separating mind and body into two</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">different forces within the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">divinity</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">we can create a trinity that&#39;s moses</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">sarah and miriam</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">so they could then have adonai elohim</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">and yava play the same role within the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">god of judaism</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">now this is what then is really the holy</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">spirit is feminine</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:40.000" style="s2">and exactly okay so it so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">moving to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.000" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">in to move to the bard absolute with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">priesthood is in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">it is father son and spirit when you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">take that into popular religion</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:52.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s practiced it&#39;s of course father</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">son another</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.240" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what the catholics god well</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">i know in judaism the holy spirit</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">is actually feminine so yes yes they</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:01.200" style="s2">changed it to masculine and christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">so that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.200" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">also and this is on to what you&#39;re let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">leave islam out of it because they have</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">their own</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">comical versions of it but at least with</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">zoroastrianism judaism and christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">we can now see a train of thought that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">makes sense where there&#39;s a unity</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">between these three hematological</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">and in this as we can go back and say if</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">christ wasn&#39;t the last savior</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">he was at least hopefully the last saver</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">to be the scapegoat and hopefully we</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">learned the lesson</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">and if you learned that as we&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">for the next savior who might come in</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">and save us completely from day one</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">by killing the tyrant to the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:37.760" style="s2">so so there&#39;s there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">link to um</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.760" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">to between christianity and these mobs</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">basically these mobs that&#39;s ancient</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">religion right it&#39;s basically paganism</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of reverting back to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">the most primitive form of religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">that&#39;s let&#39;s find something to hate</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">let&#39;s unite and let&#39;s kill it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">basically what what is often uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the idea behind that</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">that you could say like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:01.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s paganism itself right</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">but the funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">is that that these mobs they have kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">of they have kind of inherited the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">obsession of christianity with</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">protecting the victim which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">christian thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">um and and they use did they use that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">concern so the typical christian concern</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">they use that to actually create a</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:21.599" style="s2">a pagan religion or going through pagan</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.599" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">emotions so that that&#39;s a very ironic</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">situation but that&#39;s what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">you remove christ</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">so if you remove the savior that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">get the worship</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">of the victim and the the worship of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">victim is not christian</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the corruption of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">before the in the roman empire right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">the roman empire was a very civilized</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">empire right they were absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">unconcerned with protecting victims you</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">if you were a victim that meant that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">were just punished by the gods right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">so these types of mobs they would still</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">have mobs but they would use other</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">mechanisms to to to work themselves up</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">about oh yeah they&#39;re all pagan</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">you know they&#39;re pagan for one simple</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">reason they&#39;re unforgiving</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">they do not tell you there&#39;s a cell they</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">they don&#39;t give you a personal sentence</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">that says you&#39;ve got to be punished for</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:09.839" style="s2">this for the next 10 years then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">free</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.839" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">no it&#39;s forever you must be killed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">there it&#39;s final domination basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">yeah fatalistic yeah it&#39;s eternal</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">domination that is pagan that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">where pagan and christianity differs</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">because in christianity it writes</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:30.960" style="s2">forgiveness yeah so actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">internal damnation uh is is an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">that august late i read that late</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">augustine</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">he kind of promoted eternal damnation</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">but the orthodox christians they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">believe in that they don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">eternal damnation and actually paul</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">never said anything about</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">eternal damnation and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">later um</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s magnificent pagan is it meganism uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">pagan isn&#39;t entering christianity no it</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">is veganism entered christianity</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s gnostic it&#39;s not pagan</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not state</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">it&#39;s many kids manicurism has no</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">forgiveness either manicurism is just</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">the body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">evil the spirit is beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">anything dealing with the body</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.760" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">is therefore evil forever but manicurism</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">has of course like all of them have</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">pagan roots but medicine never deals</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:18.320" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:19.599" style="s2">because manicurism never deals with</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.320" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">how you&#39;re going to solve the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.599" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">problem because it&#39;s it&#39;s enthralled in</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">the scapegoating process many cases</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">spread like</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">wildfire in the third and the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">century it was the widest most spread</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">religion in the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">fighting zoroastrianism and christianity</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">on two different fronts because it has</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.599" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">kind of a simplistic knowledge it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">excellent which which is very you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">attracted to the masses on some level</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">it is gnosticism and paganism combined</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">and this is my problem all the time with</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">augustine</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">i think augustine&#39;s confessions and i</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">think resource confessions are the two</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">worst books ever written in the west</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">i will constantly have problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:56.560" style="s2">and i want to save christianity from</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">august and bring it back to paul</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.560" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">and see if we can solve this problem how</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">we match it in with zoroastrianism and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">judaism</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">because i think that was the original</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">intention of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">well the intention of christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">very simple right don&#39;t do this pagan</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.400" end="00:40:12.480" style="s2">stuff of making mobs and killing</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">uh killing these these uh these innocent</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.480" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">people all right</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">let&#39;s start using that making it it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">inversion of the heroic myth right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.480" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a total inversion of the uric myth</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">kind of alone well the bible is a myth</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:27.520" style="s2">told from the story of the person that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">that&#39;s who&#39;s the victim who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.520" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">normally the perpetrators who write the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">yeah so so christian yeah but where is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">and that also has a negative possibility</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">that can be very corrupted as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">let&#39;s not be sloppy here okay if he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">hero versus the victim</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a problem with the victim</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">existing in the story as long as there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">a hero there</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">and as long as the victim doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">after the hero</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">it&#39;s where the hero is gone the problems</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">occur</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:57.359" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what the lynch mobs today</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">are non-christian</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.359" end="00:41:01.520" style="s2">that&#39;s why they hate martin luther king</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">they try to use him whenever they do but</p>

<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">looks like that so no</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">i&#39;m saying what the dutch mob sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">business that&#39;s going on right now is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">like a corruption of christianity on</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">some level no no no that&#39;s rousseau</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">when we get rousseau and we get the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">worship of the tabula rasa we get the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">worship of the innocent child who can</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">i&#39;m saying rousseau might be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:32.800" style="s2">corruption of christianity no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">nothing christian about rousseau andre</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.800" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">i&#39;m adamant here</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">we are born sinners in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not born victims we&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">sinners it&#39;s a fundamental difference</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">sin means that we&#39;re born short we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">not born fully mature</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:55.599" style="s2">yeah so yeah so there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">there is so salvation there provided to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.599" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">to work on ourselves to then improve on</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">ourselves and get ahead in life</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s also along the time axis you do</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">certain things at certain ages</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:07.359" style="s2">there are elders in the community</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">etcetera you look up to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.359" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">this is not worship of victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">christianity would not have lasted for</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">two thousand years of a worship</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">no but i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying because i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">christianity is a worship of victim i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">saying the corruption of christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">the worship of victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">and that that&#39;s like because because the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">the lynch mobs</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:31.280" style="s2">worship the victim right uh that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:34.160" style="s2">they do uh so</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.280" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">so and chris christ is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.160" end="00:43:37.760" style="s2">victim</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">uh you know uh on some level uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">you know but he&#39;s not really but but but</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">he is you know so</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">wait a second are you on christ&#39;s side</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">or in the lynch mob side here</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">if i&#39;m a christian i&#39;m on christmas i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">definitely on christ&#39;s side</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">okay okay andrew then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.160" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same thing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:59.359" style="s2">opposites again that&#39;s what you asked</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">about the abject before and the anarchic</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:00.720" style="s2">they think do with each other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:02.960" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.720" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">opposites they&#39;re not the same thing at</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.960" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">so christ christ i didn&#39;t say the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">thing i say it&#39;s a corruption of it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">not saying they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">i&#39;m saying that that&#39;s a corruption of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">chris of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">yes says modern liberalism is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">corruption of christianity right</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">capitalism is kind of a corruption of</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">protestantism uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">or or christianity you know no no</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">can we go back to the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">worshiping a hero and worshiping a</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">victim here</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">and stay there and stay focused on</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:32.319" style="s2">master versus slave</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">okay fundamentally if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.319" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">ideology it will either worship a master</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:40.319" style="s2">or you worship slaves</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">now if you worship the slave you want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.319" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">get the master out of the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">that means either the master is gone you</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">can run a mock in the streets that will</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.280" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">lynch mobs do</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">like they do at the moment okay they</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">don&#39;t want the masters to be there</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">they hate phallus more than anything</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">they go into the feminine hysteria</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">which is the the female world without</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">males present</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s a world where you pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">the government will give you anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">magically when you ask for it</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">as if nobody had to pay taxes right</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">typical example of the current lunch</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">months</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">so magically you will get anything you</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">want at any given time</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">you are free of sin you&#39;re born innocent</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">but all-knowing yeah yeah i know i get</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">this this is the tabla rasa this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">rosso this is what the luna is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">now they don&#39;t last because you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">build the society on that foundation</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:28.560" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">for example today we are now surrounded</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.560" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">by prestige capitalism we&#39;re surrounded</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">by capitalism that pretends it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">it wants to show its virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:40.000" style="s2">and all that it&#39;s going to implode why</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s a capitalism that tries to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.000" end="00:45:44.720" style="s2">ensure itself against risk-taking</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">when a reality capitalism is built on</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.720" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">fucking risk taking you cannot be an</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:50.800" style="s2">entrepreneur unless you take risks</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.920" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s going to kill business totally</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.800" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">happen i&#39;m going to go after prestige</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">capitalism in a fundamental way in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">2020s</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">because prestige capitalism is now</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">poison within capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">capitalism is nothing but making profits</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">and if you want to be good capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">you give the money back to the workers</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">and pay them properly</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">and then you give the rest to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">shareholders that&#39;s all the capitalists</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">are supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:13.920" style="s2">and then the workers can do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">they want with their money that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">earned</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">that&#39;s good capitalism now capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">where you keep the money</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">pay your workers in a lousy manner but</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">pretend to avert the signal by giving</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">millions of dollars to black lives</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:28.160" style="s2">it&#39;s completely corrupted it it is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">capitalism that can</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.160" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">no longer be innovative and if it can no</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">longer be innovative and take risks it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">die so the problem with all the lunch</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">problems is they always die</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:41.520" style="s2">but unfortunately they get the tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">they have their 11 years of power and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.520" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">they cause havoc and they kill</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">millions when they&#39;re there this is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">problem with the french revolution</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">this is probably the 11 years of adolf</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">hitler this is the probably most</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">cultural revolution</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">to stay within this lynchpop anarchy</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re stuck with at the moment but</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">it&#39;s going to get worse and worse and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">worse until it gets better</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">and for a while it&#39;s going to get really</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">bloody that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the history lesson we learned i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:07.520" style="s2">getting this from my vanilla</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:08.839" style="s2">because evan ellich had this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.520" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.839" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">um most the pathologies that you see in</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">modernity are</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.079" style="s2">are corruption of of christianity on</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">some level and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">i think there&#39;s something to that i</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">think they&#39;re pagan muslim</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:24.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they&#39;re christian what do</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">you think thomas are you are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.559" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">following anything i&#39;m saying or yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">i i i</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">agree with you uh andrew that that uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:33.920" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">the lynch moves are often uh often</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.920" end="00:47:37.839" style="s2">fueled by some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">corrupted form of of christian thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.839" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">like again there&#39;s this typical concern</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">this this concern for the victim</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">is a typical christian thing so that has</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">survived in this pagan mob</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">and is being used to create the anoject</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">write the story of the an object and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:54.319" style="s2">to target the hater towards a group of</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">people that can be hated right</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.319" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">so so but but so in another another</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">pagan</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.000" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">uh if if you you could use other</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">mechanisms to to create mobs right but</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">but often these these mobs they use some</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">some kind of moral system that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">derived from christianity</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">because the thing then okay corrupt way</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s what andrew tried to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">point out</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:16.000" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s also what gerard</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">basically uh like</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.000" end="00:48:19.200" style="s2">like the roman empire for example they</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:21.040" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.200" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s they stopped because of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">christianity they stopped child</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">infantile you know killing children or</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">something for for example like</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">there was all this like mercy but it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">still part of the roman empire</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">yeah but okay okay yes but again using</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:40.000" style="s2">heidegger and carrying here</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">bersogen uh do you seriously think any</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.000" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">social justice warrior cares about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">victims that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">cherish as if they were heroes of course</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">oh no it&#39;s a pseudo-caring it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">a yeah it&#39;s exactly that that that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">excuse so we agree on that one yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">agree on that one yeah because it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">excuse to make a mob basically i mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">the goal is to make the mob to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">mob</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">and to have something to to hate and to</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">unite you you unite around the hatred</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">so so that&#39;s that&#39;s the real goal of</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:08.800" style="s2">so the these concerns of these and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">possession too it&#39;s fully</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.800" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">you know primitive possession of</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">ideological possession and pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">i think i think today the lunch mobs are</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">are they&#39;re bitter and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.559" style="s2">narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">and uh that means for good or bad that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.559" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">means a lot of the guys in these</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">want to step forward and personify the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">energy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:29.760" style="s2">and also i was thinking that they also</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">feed these these guys on on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.760" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">alt-right or whatever who</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">who want to you know create chaos so</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">that that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:39.680" style="s2">mussolini comes riding in on a horse and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">uh you know saves the day or</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.680" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">makes their trains run on time or oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:44.079" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">they copy each other right because</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">because what the excesses of the left</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">are then</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">are then compensated by excesses on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">right and they they kind of fuel each</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">other on right</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">yeah this is also something that gerard</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">has described so this this escalation</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">he has written a book about it actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">klozovich uh i believe so um which which</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.040" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">is basically about how countries also</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">when they get into conflict right that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">they basically escalate uh by by just</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.920" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">copying each other&#39;s actions</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">oh yeah the alt-right grows from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">outlaw red cross that&#39;s why they love</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:16.240" style="s2">each other the name for that is portland</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">oregon today</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.240" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">that is a place that has it&#39;s been going</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">on now for months and there&#39;s no end to</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:24.079" style="s2">and portland oregon is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">place where the old left and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.079" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">alt-right in america are being</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">at the moment which means the escalation</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">will continue and they will start</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:31.920" style="s2">shooting each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">thaddeus russell then has the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.920" end="00:50:34.319" style="s2">the national guard should relatively</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">have to step in and shoot them all</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.319" end="00:50:37.280" style="s2">because of america&#39;s always done maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">that will save america maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.280" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">constitution will say america</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">but the havoc will certainly be there</p>

<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">if the husband is jealous it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">pathological right so nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">saying that the escapes or escape goats</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:06.640" style="s2">are necessarily completely innocent or</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">even part of the innocent</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.640" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">but they are turned into something that</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">and this is something that christianity</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">very much warns about so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s a corrupted form of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">christianity because christianity very</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">careful</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">about about attributing complete guilt</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:24.960" style="s2">to people and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">painting them as inhuman because that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.960" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">that&#39;s very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">that&#39;s basically a pain that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">paganism basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">yeah okay well that&#39;s why these</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">even people he he strongly disagreed</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:53.359" style="s2">that he made them very human and</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:55.599" style="s2">understandable</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.359" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">exactly yeah just i was thinking of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.599" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">whole host of</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">doskieskian characters which are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:02.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:04.079" style="s2">very essential it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.400" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">pattern here and i mean i need to work</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.079" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">more on it and certainly learn from you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:09.200" style="s2">guys about the scapegoat as i just</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">learned from thomas here respectfully</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.200" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">uh what i&#39;ve been concentrating on is</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">the opposition between the anoject and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:15.839" style="s2">the object</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">and the object this is stream strictly</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.839" end="00:56:19.359" style="s2">lynch mob technique so</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:20.559" style="s2">the absolute somebody that unifies the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.359" end="00:56:22.000" style="s2">lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.559" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">all the cowards of the villains who are</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.000" end="00:56:24.720" style="s2">unified because they comfortably can</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">attack somebody</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.720" end="00:56:28.319" style="s2">and within the lynch mob soon the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">materializes the idea of a shared</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.319" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">voice shared opinion that the goal can</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:34.319" style="s2">hide behind this</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:35.599" style="s2">voice in an anonymous matter that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.319" end="00:56:38.480" style="s2">it&#39;s called the anoject</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.599" end="00:56:40.319" style="s2">as soon as the anarchy exists it</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.480" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">provides an opportunity for somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.319" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">step in and take the role and just speak</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.319" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">as if he or she was the antiject him or</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:48.240" style="s2">herself she&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:49.440" style="s2">probably somebody&#39;s very intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.240" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:54.960" style="s2">sociopathic power grabbing and has</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">no nothing left for anybody else except</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.960" end="00:56:58.079" style="s2">him herself</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">so it is certainly hitler character but</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.079" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">it certainly did several of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">characters in the social justice warrior</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">bob at the moment who could take on that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:06.480" style="s2">the anarchic steps forward takes on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.640" end="00:57:08.319" style="s2">leadership and by simply speaking in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.480" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">way that is assumed</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.319" end="00:57:11.440" style="s2">to be the proper say bourgeois middle</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:13.440" style="s2">class attitude</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.440" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">towards the rest of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.440" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">becomes the antidepth and the anardic</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">will then</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:20.799" style="s2">milk whatever victim they find out there</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">who they don&#39;t care for the victims that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.799" end="00:57:24.319" style="s2">are dead are perfect because the dead</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">victim making them milk</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.319" end="00:57:29.520" style="s2">to continue their story so for example</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:32.319" style="s2">hitler would have gone around after 1933</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.520" end="00:57:34.720" style="s2">and any sort of aryan young man who had</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.319" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">been mistreated in any way whatsoever by</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.720" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">any jew at any time could have been used</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">as victim</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:42.720" style="s2">in that sense to add to that story and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">that&#39;s how the story escalates</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.720" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">now the scapegoating mechanism though is</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:47.440" style="s2">different from that so that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">gerard and christianity comes into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.440" end="00:57:51.599" style="s2">picture that&#39;s when it gets a lot richer</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:55.359" style="s2">and and um i guess i have to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.599" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.359" end="00:57:58.720" style="s2">how is the scapegoat different from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:01.280" style="s2">object let&#39;s put it that way it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.720" end="00:58:03.359" style="s2">only a difference in perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.280" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">the scapegoat is always an object but</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.359" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">not all objects are scapegoats</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.000" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">the scapegoat could be anybody i as far</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:11.839" style="s2">as i understood</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">he he didn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t it&#39;s random who</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.839" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">is it&#39;s absolutely random it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:18.640" style="s2">he&#39;s guilty according to arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:21.119" style="s2">okay but he&#39;s skilled according to</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.640" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">everybody if i run a lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.119" end="00:58:24.720" style="s2">it&#39;s only my lynch mob to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:25.119" style="s2">convinced that the guy we&#39;re going after</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.720" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">is an</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.119" end="00:58:29.040" style="s2">abject yeah it&#39;s based on human</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:31.280" style="s2">sacrifice think of it that way like</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">think of it in his most primitive sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.280" end="00:58:35.280" style="s2">right the scapegoat is the cripple who</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.280" end="00:58:39.119" style="s2">you you would scapegoat him you would</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:41.839" style="s2">sacrifice to him</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.119" end="00:58:43.359" style="s2">to make the gods happy to end the war of</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.839" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">all against all</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.359" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">um you know to end the the natural the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">aggression that would exist and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">and and uh to it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:53.920" style="s2">this you know the human the human desire</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.920" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">for um for for you know uh for for blood</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">is appeased</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">oh yeah i i get i get it from gerard</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:03.599" style="s2">that there&#39;s tension and the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">release the tension is to find a</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.599" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">scapegoat and that is the release</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">uh and but like thomas said this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">what&#39;s so important the scapegoat is</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">guilty according to everybody the escape</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.520" end="00:59:14.000" style="s2">code is a homo saucer as george organ</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:16.319" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.000" end="00:59:17.599" style="s2">he&#39;s completely dehumanized only then</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.319" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">can he be the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.599" end="00:59:21.440" style="s2">so even if he&#39;s randomly picked doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">matter he has to be dehumanized at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.440" end="00:59:24.720" style="s2">point here</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">i mean everybody&#39;s created is that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.720" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">entire public</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.680" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s a religious it&#39;s a the thing of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">the scapegoat it&#39;s a religious</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">ceremony right almost it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:34.960" style="s2">very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:37.359" style="s2">it&#39;s the beginning of religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.960" end="00:59:39.839" style="s2">that&#39;s gerard&#39;s theory</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.359" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">that the religion begins with that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.839" end="00:59:44.960" style="s2">first altar that you build and then you</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:46.559" style="s2">you know you put the scapegoat on them</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.960" end="00:59:48.559" style="s2">and then and then that&#39;s how human</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.559" end="00:59:51.200" style="s2">civilization develops that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.559" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the radicality of of gerard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.200" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">idea well</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">the first again</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.119" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">the the the first altar was or the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.280" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">stones that were covering the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:02.400" style="s2">the body of the person that was stoned</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:04.319" style="s2">to death right</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.400" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the images that gerard</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.319" end="01:00:08.559" style="s2">uses so for and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:09.280" style="s2">most religions they basically try to to</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.559" end="01:00:12.880" style="s2">channel</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.280" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">this uh these mob dynamics so that they</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.880" end="01:00:15.599" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:17.040" style="s2">released and experienced but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.599" end="01:00:19.119" style="s2">destroy everybody</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.040" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">because if if this mechanism is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.119" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">controlled and then you get</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">a war of all against all and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:26.480" style="s2">basically you have a big slaughterhouse</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">right so religion tries to</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.480" end="01:00:30.079" style="s2">to channel this this victimish mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">so that it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.079" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">workable that&#39;s pagan religion and so so</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:35.920" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:37.680" style="s2">myth and then on christianity kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.920" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">dismantles this and says like well this</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.680" end="01:00:40.559" style="s2">is not the right way to bring people</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:42.480" style="s2">together and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.559" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s get away from this</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.480" end="01:00:44.799" style="s2">victimized mechanism so they replace</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.319" end="01:00:46.640" style="s2">myth</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.799" end="01:00:48.480" style="s2">with gospel so this is why the bible is</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.640" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">not it&#39;s not a mythical text it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.480" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a gospel text so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">funny enough why jordan peterson is</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.160" end="01:00:56.559" style="s2">often a bit like</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">he actually has a very pagan uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.559" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">way of looking at the bible and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">constantly interpreting us as</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.520" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">mythological stories right</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">while while this this very core there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.520" end="01:01:08.799" style="s2">a realism right that that</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">is introduced is that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.799" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">with the gospels right because</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">everything is fantastical in in</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:15.040" style="s2">mythology</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">and then suddenly suddenly you get this</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.040" end="01:01:18.799" style="s2">like common criminal</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:19.440" style="s2">you know crucified on a cross and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.799" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:24.079" style="s2">the event it&#39;s the introduction of</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">realism on some level</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.079" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">is that what jordan peterson says or no</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">no no that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:33.520" style="s2">that&#39;s i i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:34.160" style="s2">yeah yeah paraphrasing gerard yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.520" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:37.280" style="s2">you know you have these these nice</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">mythological texts and suddenly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.280" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">this story of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.400" end="01:01:42.480" style="s2">of of somebody was actually killed as</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">the most common criminal right because</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.480" end="01:01:45.680" style="s2">crucifixion was something that was used</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:48.000" style="s2">abundantly</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.680" end="01:01:49.040" style="s2">it was not not very it was not a special</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.040" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">punishment the romans crucified uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">people all the time yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">i&#39;m still going back to the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">versus abject here um</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">well i think that the difference is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:07.680" style="s2">so for the for the scapegoat right</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.520" end="01:02:09.280" style="s2">that you need so so as far as i</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.680" end="01:02:10.720" style="s2">understand from christeva so the object</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.280" end="01:02:12.160" style="s2">is also something that you reject like</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.720" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">she gives this example of</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.160" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">this milk that had gone bad and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">when it touches her lips then she</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:21.039" style="s2">recoils so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.680" end="01:02:23.440" style="s2">the object something that is outside but</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.039" end="01:02:24.480" style="s2">but the scapegoat needs to you need to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.440" end="01:02:26.079" style="s2">be interested</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.480" end="01:02:27.520" style="s2">in coming together and kill the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.079" end="01:02:29.680" style="s2">scapegoat so like an</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.520" end="01:02:31.280" style="s2">orgasmic explosion of violence so</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">there&#39;s something very attractive in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.280" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">scapegoat as well</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:37.920" style="s2">so there might be a certain difference</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:40.960" style="s2">there right so that</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.920" end="01:02:41.599" style="s2">that the object of christeva and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.960" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.599" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">the the the scapegoat of uh of of girard</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:48.559" style="s2">but they&#39;re very related yeah the thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">is that we read it through hitler and</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.559" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">stalin and mao and then we discovered</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">they used the jew they used the kulak</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">and they used the parent</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:02:58.559" style="s2">uh as both scapegoats and objects so</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:00.799" style="s2">they they unified</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.559" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">their crowd their party their movement</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.799" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">it was it wasn&#39;t a universal hatred</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">towards somebody it was just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:07.839" style="s2">within the group</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">within the sort of civilized population</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.839" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">within the political party</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.359" end="01:03:14.400" style="s2">and that was the world anyway that was</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.119" end="01:03:16.240" style="s2">their echo chamber</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.400" end="01:03:18.240" style="s2">and then they found an abject and by</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.240" end="01:03:19.680" style="s2">killing going after and slowly killing</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.240" end="01:03:22.000" style="s2">the subject</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:23.200" style="s2">they uh would then maintain their power</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.000" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">and and they</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.200" end="01:03:26.000" style="s2">maintain this enormous sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:26.640" style="s2">togetherness and loyalty towards the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.000" end="01:03:27.839" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.640" end="01:03:29.760" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what these systems were</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.839" end="01:03:31.440" style="s2">incredibly productive too</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.760" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">then of course they got mismanaged after</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.440" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">a while because they they completely</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:36.640" style="s2">trusted a dictator to know where to go</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:37.920" style="s2">and when hitler took tons of amphetamine</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.640" end="01:03:38.480" style="s2">and started the war against the soviet</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.920" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">union</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.480" end="01:03:41.920" style="s2">stalin hitler just killed each other</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:43.680" style="s2">eventually in that process and killed</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.920" end="01:03:44.160" style="s2">100 million people in the process which</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:46.000" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.160" end="01:03:47.920" style="s2">two lynch mobs go to war with each other</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.000" end="01:03:49.839" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a universal scapegoat</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.920" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">they all dehumanize rather than they</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.839" end="01:03:53.920" style="s2">take the different</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">uh scapegoats they&#39;ve had they might</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.920" end="01:03:57.039" style="s2">change the interchange change them</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:03:58.640" style="s2">between each other exchange scapegoat</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.039" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">certainly the jews had a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.640" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">in stalin&#39;s russia</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:03.200" style="s2">after hitler folded ironically and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:05.760" style="s2">sure it wasn&#39;t easier</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.200" end="01:04:06.960" style="s2">for ukrainian kulak to appear subtly in</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.760" end="01:04:09.200" style="s2">germany he wasn&#39;t cherished when he</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.960" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">arrived there in 1946 probably hated do</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.200" end="01:04:12.640" style="s2">because these were like trash material</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:14.000" style="s2">this is like yeah these are trash people</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.640" end="01:04:15.520" style="s2">they&#39;re destroyed anyway we might as</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:16.240" style="s2">well hate them the way our enemy hated</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.520" end="01:04:18.079" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.240" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">so in that sense there&#39;s a similarity</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.079" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">between scapegoat and abject</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:25.119" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting but it is it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:26.720" style="s2">objection theory as the overall theory</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.119" end="01:04:29.359" style="s2">is called it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.720" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">how you unify a population by finding</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.359" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">something that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:35.920" style="s2">hate together and of course as a human</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">being you have to dehumanize it</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.920" end="01:04:39.680" style="s2">to then allow yourself to hate it</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:41.520" style="s2">without remorse</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.680" end="01:04:43.119" style="s2">yeah and the other way of doing that</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.520" end="01:04:44.559" style="s2">without the remorse it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.119" end="01:04:46.160" style="s2">it&#39;s okay according to the official</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.559" end="01:04:47.200" style="s2">ideology to hate the jew because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.160" end="01:04:50.720" style="s2">a nazi</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.200" end="01:04:53.440" style="s2">it&#39;s also that somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.720" end="01:04:54.720" style="s2">speaks through the crowd so hitler is</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.440" end="01:04:56.000" style="s2">ultimately responsible we need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.720" end="01:04:59.039" style="s2">personify his time</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.000" end="01:05:00.720" style="s2">but before hitler comes forward</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.039" end="01:05:02.400" style="s2">there must have been a lunch mob</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.720" end="01:05:05.359" style="s2">existing already where everybody</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.400" end="01:05:06.559" style="s2">passively waiting for the tyrant to step</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.359" end="01:05:09.200" style="s2">forward and take over</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.559" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s not how saviors work the</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.200" end="01:05:13.359" style="s2">savior works the opposite way</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:14.240" style="s2">the savior comes in and kills the dragon</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.359" end="01:05:16.640" style="s2">so the savior</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.240" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">fights political correctness the savior</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.640" end="01:05:20.880" style="s2">fights against the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:22.319" style="s2">the savior brings a whole new world a</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.880" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">whole new paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.319" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">a whole new emergence vector if you want</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:28.160" style="s2">with him</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">and then forces the new world onto the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.160" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">people and they&#39;re like they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:32.160" style="s2">to accept it the same across the holy</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:34.319" style="s2">world let&#39;s say he said</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.160" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">this is the new world and you better</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.319" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">adapt to it because i want to take you</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:40.000" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:41.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s why the savior takes you into</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.000" end="01:05:43.119" style="s2">where you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:45.039" style="s2">and brings a minority of people who say</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.119" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">yes to being saved</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.039" end="01:05:48.160" style="s2">wear them into the exodus and they then</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:49.760" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.160" end="01:05:51.599" style="s2">into the promised land which is another</p>

<p begin="01:05:51.599" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">so they don&#39;t literally kill anybody</p>
