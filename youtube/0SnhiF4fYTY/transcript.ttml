<p begin="00:02:06.509" end="00:02:12.750" style="s2">third Friday at 3 p.m. est we live</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:13.990" style="s2">stream a live Q&amp;A in which I answer more</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:19.660" style="s2">general broad</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.990" end="00:02:23.710" style="s2">you might have so today I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.660" end="00:02:27.460" style="s2">about a very important principle and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.710" end="00:02:29.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the principle of integrity now when</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.460" end="00:02:33.190" style="s2">I say that word what tends to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.320" end="00:02:35.080" style="s2">and not completely inappropriately but</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.190" end="00:02:37.540" style="s2">nevertheless a little bit off what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.080" end="00:02:40.990" style="s2">want to focus on people here sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.540" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">moral term a virtue and of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.990" end="00:02:45.370" style="s2">integrity is a virtue and it means</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:48.180" style="s2">something like being true to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.370" end="00:02:52.240" style="s2">principles that you hold our most true</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.180" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">that has tended in our culture to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.240" end="00:02:58.960" style="s2">conflated and confused with authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.080" end="00:03:01.600" style="s2">and I think sometimes when people are</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.960" end="00:03:05.230" style="s2">saying authenticity they really mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.600" end="00:03:08.130" style="s2">really being integrity because integrity</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.230" end="00:03:10.540" style="s2">is the virtue that protects you from</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.130" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">hypocrisy because what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.540" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re being true to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:19.330" style="s2">principles that you hold to be most true</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:23.230" style="s2">but sometimes authenticity also means</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.330" end="00:03:25.510" style="s2">this other thing this sort of romantic</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.230" end="00:03:27.250" style="s2">notion of being true to your true self</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.510" end="00:03:30.340" style="s2">and it&#39;s unclear what that is and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.250" end="00:03:32.830" style="s2">there&#39;s so I want to put that aside I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.340" end="00:03:35.770" style="s2">have some criticisms of that notion many</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.830" end="00:03:37.450" style="s2">people do these days within sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.770" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">philosophical circles so let&#39;s put that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.450" end="00:03:41.310" style="s2">aside we&#39;re not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:45.810" style="s2">authenticity we&#39;re not completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.310" end="00:03:48.550" style="s2">separate from the virtue of integrity</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.810" end="00:03:50.220" style="s2">but what I want to do is I want to go it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.550" end="00:03:53.980" style="s2">from thinking of it just as this virtue</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.220" end="00:03:58.390" style="s2">to what we need which are principles of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.980" end="00:04:00.390" style="s2">practice training principles or as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.390" end="00:04:03.310" style="s2">put in the traditions that I was taught</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.390" end="00:04:06.580" style="s2">we want training precepts precepts to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.310" end="00:04:07.959" style="s2">tell us how to properly train so what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.580" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">it we&#39;re training and what is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.959" end="00:04:12.990" style="s2">notion of integrity well let&#39;s turn it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:15.160" style="s2">into instead of the virtue of integrity</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.990" end="00:04:18.790" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about the process of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.160" end="00:04:22.090" style="s2">integration and we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.790" end="00:04:25.630" style="s2">practicing this from the beginning at</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.090" end="00:04:27.130" style="s2">the end of every sit I say slowly come</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.630" end="00:04:30.550" style="s2">out of you sit or your practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.130" end="00:04:32.200" style="s2">trying as best you can to integrate what</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.550" end="00:04:33.550" style="s2">you&#39;ve cultivated in your practice with</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.200" end="00:04:36.580" style="s2">your everyday consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.550" end="00:04:38.500" style="s2">cognition and that your sitting is not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.580" end="00:04:41.500" style="s2">vacation it&#39;s an education for</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.500" end="00:04:43.690" style="s2">transforming your life so that process</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.500" end="00:04:46.480" style="s2">of integrating what you&#39;re doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:50.470" style="s2">practice with the patterns of your life</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.480" end="00:04:52.900" style="s2">that&#39;s the integrity that we&#39;re focusing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.470" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">in on here we want the patterns in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.900" end="00:04:59.200" style="s2">life and the patterns in our practice to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:00.670" style="s2">the friend each other we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.200" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">be trying to call it a one set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.670" end="00:05:04.570" style="s2">practices one set of patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:07.780" style="s2">principles and there are practice and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.570" end="00:05:10.060" style="s2">then live different principles and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.780" end="00:05:12.520" style="s2">patterns in our lives because then they</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.060" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">will actually be undermining and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.520" end="00:05:17.230" style="s2">conflict with each other so the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:20.020" style="s2">part of this is of the integration is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.230" end="00:05:23.980" style="s2">extend this notion of befriending</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.020" end="00:05:26.350" style="s2">oneself so that what we&#39;re cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.980" end="00:05:29.400" style="s2">in our practice and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.350" end="00:05:31.780" style="s2">practicing in our life are in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.400" end="00:05:34.330" style="s2">reciprocal opening a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.780" end="00:05:35.770" style="s2">reinforcing the reciprocal affording</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.330" end="00:05:38.980" style="s2">relationship they&#39;re preventing each</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.770" end="00:05:40.330" style="s2">other that&#39;s the first part of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.980" end="00:05:42.970" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do what is meant by</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.330" end="00:05:44.950" style="s2">integration and then if we zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.970" end="00:05:47.740" style="s2">that a more specific meaning is what</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.950" end="00:05:50.770" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do with the training</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.740" end="00:05:53.140" style="s2">precepts is we&#39;re trying to afford</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:56.050" style="s2">moments of application and transfer</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.140" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">we&#39;re building a bridge and so the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.050" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">of the precepts is to call out it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:06.250" style="s2">call out like oh oh oh moments where we</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:08.640" style="s2">notice where we notice that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.250" end="00:06:11.560" style="s2">mindfulness well that we can apply our</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.640" end="00:06:13.690" style="s2">practice to our life it&#39;s like oh here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.560" end="00:06:15.910" style="s2">where I could step back and look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.690" end="00:06:20.020" style="s2">here&#39;s where I could come into centric</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.910" end="00:06:21.970" style="s2">Ness and rootedness here is where I</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.020" end="00:06:24.460" style="s2">could try and get into a more flowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.970" end="00:06:27.970" style="s2">relationship with all the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.460" end="00:06:30.010" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in this situation so</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.970" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">what and what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.010" end="00:06:34.180" style="s2">we&#39;re not only trying to get harmony and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:36.790" style="s2">that&#39;s important like that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.180" end="00:06:39.430" style="s2">residents but we&#39;re also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.790" end="00:06:40.340" style="s2">expand it we&#39;re trying to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.430" end="00:06:43.400" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.340" end="00:06:46.970" style="s2">teas for where we will apply what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.400" end="00:06:50.060" style="s2">trained in our practice to our life we</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.970" end="00:06:53.510" style="s2">will also thereby do the do the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.060" end="00:06:57.350" style="s2">we will more and more flag moments of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.510" end="00:07:00.500" style="s2">our life as things that we get that get</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.350" end="00:07:06.770" style="s2">taken into our practice that remind us</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.500" end="00:07:11.990" style="s2">of the Buddha the Dharma and the same so</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.770" end="00:07:14.030" style="s2">I want to present the five training</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.990" end="00:07:16.580" style="s2">precepts Buddhist love numbered list the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.030" end="00:07:18.200" style="s2">five training precepts and what I want</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.580" end="00:07:20.389" style="s2">to really refocus them and even</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.200" end="00:07:23.330" style="s2">reformulate their wording to give</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.389" end="00:07:27.050" style="s2">emphasis to there&#39;s not being just sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.330" end="00:07:30.530" style="s2">of a vague moral set of commands for</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.050" end="00:07:34.220" style="s2">getting this sort of not too clear</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.530" end="00:07:36.380" style="s2">notion of moral integrity instead we</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.220" end="00:07:40.449" style="s2">want very clear three clear and concrete</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.380" end="00:07:45.050" style="s2">way of trying to afford the harmony and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.449" end="00:07:46.729" style="s2">trying to afford opportunity so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.050" end="00:07:49.639" style="s2">present the traditional version of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.729" end="00:07:51.889" style="s2">precept and then how I recommend we</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.639" end="00:07:54.470" style="s2">formulate we how we reformulate it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.889" end="00:07:58.010" style="s2">really zero in on the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.470" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">integration so the first one is do not</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.010" end="00:08:05.510" style="s2">kill so the problem that is its command</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:07.760" style="s2">and then we tend to hear it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.510" end="00:08:11.560" style="s2">obedience to the command there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.760" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">external rule and it leaves out a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.560" end="00:08:19.849" style="s2">what I was trying to put an emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:23.330" style="s2">so instead of instead of acquiescing or</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.849" end="00:08:27.800" style="s2">obeying a command instead I propose you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.330" end="00:08:29.419" style="s2">reformulate it as a pump as a promise or</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.800" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">a vow that you&#39;re making to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.419" end="00:08:36.740" style="s2">because this is the way of creating that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:39.289" style="s2">befriended and then also the problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.740" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">with these these the traditional version</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.289" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">of these precepts is they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">negatively formulated they only limit</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:50.490" style="s2">what you shouldn&#39;t do they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:52.860" style="s2">actually make you seek opportunity so</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.490" end="00:08:57.649" style="s2">I would propose the following instead of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.860" end="00:09:02.360" style="s2">do not kill this I promise not to harm</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.649" end="00:09:06.570" style="s2">but to mindfully enhance and enrich life</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.360" end="00:09:09.240" style="s2">so what we can note right is we can try</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.570" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">and throw our day because what are we</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.240" end="00:09:12.510" style="s2">doing what are we doing in the practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.459" style="s2">well we&#39;re trying to heal and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.510" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">trying to transform and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.459" end="00:09:19.320" style="s2">grow but if we&#39;re out in our life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">we&#39;re harming and we&#39;re limiting and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.320" end="00:09:24.029" style="s2">we&#39;re restricting growth and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:26.339" style="s2">restricting transformation right then</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.029" end="00:09:31.050" style="s2">these things are dissonant with each</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.339" end="00:09:35.370" style="s2">other also moments where you could write</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.050" end="00:09:38.190" style="s2">actually help somebody and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.370" end="00:09:40.920" style="s2">have to do this mindfully well you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.190" end="00:09:45.180" style="s2">act in such a way as to enhance and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.920" end="00:09:47.610" style="s2">enrich life our moments of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.180" end="00:09:50.790" style="s2">for the application of what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.610" end="00:09:53.010" style="s2">doing in your mindfulness practice I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.790" end="00:09:55.529" style="s2">not going to tell you the particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.010" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">energies of how to do this or even the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.529" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">particular ethical framework you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:00.839" style="s2">want to bring to bear on that that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:03.959" style="s2">not my I do not have that place or that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.839" end="00:10:07.950" style="s2">role for you I&#39;m trying to get you to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.959" end="00:10:09.390" style="s2">see how you could extend and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.950" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">what you&#39;re cultivating your practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.390" end="00:10:16.550" style="s2">into your life so I promise not to harm</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:19.589" style="s2">but to mindfully enhance and enrich life</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.550" end="00:10:25.589" style="s2">so the next one is you know do not steal</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.589" end="00:10:27.000" style="s2">and again you know you know you know you</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.589" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">may even be able to go through an entire</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.000" end="00:10:33.560" style="s2">day especially now without stealing even</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:36.810" style="s2">minor stealing very very minor stealing</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.560" end="00:10:39.779" style="s2">so again is is that going to be that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.810" end="00:10:41.670" style="s2">effective I think we&#39;ve all been</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.779" end="00:10:44.520" style="s2">socialized to a significant degree work</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.670" end="00:10:47.100" style="s2">at a moral level where that&#39;s largely</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.520" end="00:10:49.190" style="s2">something we&#39;re probably satisfying but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.100" end="00:10:52.470" style="s2">let&#39;s turn it around</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.190" end="00:10:56.070" style="s2">let&#39;s turn let&#39;s think about how our</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.470" end="00:10:59.150" style="s2">relationship to possessions and material</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.070" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">objects is something in which Co</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.150" end="00:11:04.249" style="s2">identification</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:08.120" style="s2">and automatic and reactive behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.249" end="00:11:10.459" style="s2">very prevalent so our relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.120" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">our possessions and to material things</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.459" end="00:11:17.589" style="s2">is actually a fertile field in which we</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:23.029" style="s2">can plant the seeds of mindfulness so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.589" end="00:11:27.309" style="s2">how about instead of don&#39;t steal as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.029" end="00:11:29.569" style="s2">promised not to use or perhaps relate</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.309" end="00:11:32.449" style="s2">I&#39;ll like relate better some people like</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.569" end="00:11:35.720" style="s2">use better I promise not to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.449" end="00:11:40.689" style="s2">material things mindlessly but mindfully</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.720" end="00:11:44.499" style="s2">and wisely so notice the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.689" end="00:11:48.170" style="s2">objects are projections of your identity</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.499" end="00:11:51.290" style="s2">notice way of ways in which material</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.170" end="00:11:55.519" style="s2">things perhaps are giving you a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.290" end="00:11:58.009" style="s2">stability or solidity and you might want</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:12:00.819" style="s2">to reflect on that you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.009" end="00:12:04.279" style="s2">note it you might want to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.819" end="00:12:06.350" style="s2">why does this why do I want this object</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.279" end="00:12:08.809" style="s2">near me all the time</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.350" end="00:12:10.790" style="s2">why do I want to control that and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.809" end="00:12:13.160" style="s2">what you&#39;re seeing here of course I hope</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.790" end="00:12:15.290" style="s2">is that one of the things we can do in</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.160" end="00:12:17.389" style="s2">the mindfulness is we can periodically</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.290" end="00:12:19.370" style="s2">and remember neither one of these modes</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.389" end="00:12:22.670" style="s2">is good or bad but we can periodically</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.370" end="00:12:25.430" style="s2">shift from having mode towards material</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.670" end="00:12:30.019" style="s2">things into a being mode towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.430" end="00:12:34.250" style="s2">material things okay not only material</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.019" end="00:12:37.189" style="s2">things I&#39;m in academia and so doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.250" end="00:12:39.559" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this with ideas especially</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.189" end="00:12:41.149" style="s2">other people&#39;s ideas is very important</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.559" end="00:12:46.370" style="s2">so for example I try to be very</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.149" end="00:12:47.959" style="s2">stringent about giving people credit for</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.370" end="00:12:50.059" style="s2">their ideas and how they&#39;ve influenced</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.959" end="00:12:52.699" style="s2">on me and try to make it very clear how</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.059" end="00:12:54.800" style="s2">much other people write anything that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.699" end="00:13:00.829" style="s2">produce has always been produced in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.800" end="00:13:03.470" style="s2">concert with other people so those are</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.829" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">the first two will put ascription of all</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.470" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">of these also in the notes for this</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:14.630" style="s2">video so we&#39;ve got I promise not to harm</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:17.300" style="s2">but to mindfully enhance enrich life I</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.630" end="00:13:19.850" style="s2">promise not to use or relate to material</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.300" end="00:13:24.890" style="s2">things mindlessly but mindfully and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.850" end="00:13:29.990" style="s2">wisely the next is what I&#39;m doing which</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.890" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">is speech language so in traditional</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.990" end="00:13:37.610" style="s2">form it&#39;s don&#39;t don&#39;t lie and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.700" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a challenge to to not</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.610" end="00:13:43.820" style="s2">try to lie throughout an entire day even</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:45.980" style="s2">one or light and so that and of itself I</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.820" end="00:13:48.020" style="s2">think is valuable but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.980" end="00:13:50.660" style="s2">something missing from it again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.020" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">a golden opportunity because there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.660" end="00:13:55.760" style="s2">nothing that is so deeply interwoven</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:58.100" style="s2">with our sense of our humanity and our</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.760" end="00:13:59.660" style="s2">personhood as language I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.100" end="00:14:00.890" style="s2">greatest philosophers of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.660" end="00:14:02.930" style="s2">century like Vic and Shania and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.890" end="00:14:05.330" style="s2">Heidegger independently zeroed in on</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.930" end="00:14:07.910" style="s2">this idea that it&#39;s it&#39;s our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.330" end="00:14:10.850" style="s2">use language that most distinguishes us</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.910" end="00:14:12.440" style="s2">as persons from the other organisms on</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.850" end="00:14:15.680" style="s2">this planet and then of course how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.440" end="00:14:18.050" style="s2">particularly use language is how we how</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.680" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">we spin and weave the autobiography of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.050" end="00:14:28.580" style="s2">our own individual person so and this</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:30.530" style="s2">did this has also something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.580" end="00:14:32.210" style="s2">seen from the philosophical tradition</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.530" end="00:14:36.760" style="s2">especially coming home of Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.210" end="00:14:42.770" style="s2">Plato one of the most fundamental ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.760" end="00:14:45.740" style="s2">in which we can care for ourselves care</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.770" end="00:14:49.790" style="s2">for each other and care for our humanity</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.740" end="00:14:53.450" style="s2">is being careful in our speech taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.790" end="00:14:55.640" style="s2">care of it caring about it and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.450" end="00:15:01.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean caring that people agree</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.640" end="00:15:07.340" style="s2">with us it means paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.520" end="00:15:11.510" style="s2">what&#39;s at work in our speech that sloppy</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.340" end="00:15:14.270" style="s2">and careless speech of course becomes</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.510" end="00:15:17.990" style="s2">sloppy and careless thought which</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.270" end="00:15:21.220" style="s2">becomes sloppy and careless action which</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.990" end="00:15:23.780" style="s2">then becomes a sloppy and careless life</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.220" end="00:15:24.890" style="s2">now I&#39;m being a little overdramatic here</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.780" end="00:15:26.900" style="s2">because I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not showing</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.890" end="00:15:28.170" style="s2">inevitability but I&#39;m showing a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.900" end="00:15:33.300" style="s2">distinct possibility</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.170" end="00:15:35.220" style="s2">progression so in some traditions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.300" end="00:15:39.420" style="s2">not allowed to even engage in idle talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.220" end="00:15:41.610" style="s2">right I&#39;m not I&#39;m not so sure that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.420" end="00:15:44.160" style="s2">might be too strict I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.610" end="00:15:46.199" style="s2">there&#39;s important social function of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.160" end="00:15:47.699" style="s2">pleasantries right we&#39;re we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.199" end="00:15:49.949" style="s2">trying to say we&#39;re all in this together</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.699" end="00:15:52.470" style="s2">or we&#39;re sharing a society and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.949" end="00:15:54.600" style="s2">just signaling that but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.470" end="00:15:58.589" style="s2">fair to say that our culture has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.600" end="00:16:01.260" style="s2">especially awash in the abuse of speech</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.589" end="00:16:04.949" style="s2">and language and this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.260" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">pertinent and powerful place where we</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.949" end="00:16:13.889" style="s2">could all bring mindfulness to bear so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">promise not to speak mindlessly but</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.889" end="00:16:25.940" style="s2">mindfully wisely so another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:29.100" style="s2">precious coin is of course our sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.940" end="00:16:32.070" style="s2">the fourth precept is don&#39;t commit</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.100" end="00:16:33.570" style="s2">adultery it&#39;s not clear that that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.070" end="00:16:35.820" style="s2">a relevant thing for us because our</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.570" end="00:16:39.000" style="s2">notions of relationship and marriage and</p>

<p begin="00:16:50.820" end="00:17:00.089" style="s2">about how deeply your sexuality weds</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.510" end="00:17:03.089" style="s2">right the sort of the highest levels of</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.429" end="00:17:16.890" style="s2">of my sexuality reach up to the height</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.350" end="00:17:19.380" style="s2">of my spirituality there&#39;s a whole</p>

<p begin="00:17:24.270" end="00:17:30.900" style="s2">is to realize the tremendous integrative</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.350" end="00:17:34.020" style="s2">and also therefore this integrative</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.900" end="00:17:36.230" style="s2">power of sexuality are you practicing</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.020" end="00:17:39.419" style="s2">your sexuality in a way that enhances</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.230" end="00:17:41.640" style="s2">integration that is a place where you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.299" end="00:18:09.690" style="s2">pornography does of course is it severus</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.110" end="00:18:11.820" style="s2">connection its severs learning because</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.690" end="00:18:14.510" style="s2">it goes for instant gratification and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.820" end="00:18:19.040" style="s2">goes for the salience of the stimulus as</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.510" end="00:18:22.500" style="s2">opposed to the meaning of the relation</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.040" end="00:18:24.870" style="s2">and so again I&#39;m not I&#39;m not a prude I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.500" end="00:18:26.549" style="s2">not telling you what to do the point of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.870" end="00:18:30.510" style="s2">this precept and like I said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.549" end="00:18:32.669" style="s2">this whole tradition is this is a place</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.510" end="00:18:35.370" style="s2">in which we should be bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.669" end="00:18:38.370" style="s2">principles of our practice to bear it</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.370" end="00:18:41.400" style="s2">also means if we if we befriend our</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.370" end="00:18:43.799" style="s2">sexuality with mindfulness our sexual</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.400" end="00:18:48.540" style="s2">issues and all of us have unresolved</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.799" end="00:18:51.990" style="s2">issues Thank You Freud right can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.540" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">addressed potentially within the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.990" end="00:18:56.549" style="s2">meditative setting now of course I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:58.440" style="s2">saying that that&#39;s a panacea therapy</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.549" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">might be needed other things might be</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.440" end="00:19:02.490" style="s2">needed but when we bring up this bridge</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:09.240" style="s2">this is how we can start addressing</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.490" end="00:19:15.410" style="s2">these issues so I promise not to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.240" end="00:19:18.419" style="s2">practice sex mindlessly but mindfully I</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.410" end="00:19:21.630" style="s2">think again about can you come into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.419" end="00:19:24.679" style="s2">be in mode and make love as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.630" end="00:19:24.679" style="s2">just having sex</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.910" end="00:19:33.540" style="s2">the last one is tricky for our culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.080" end="00:19:35.130" style="s2">and it&#39;s also tricky in another was in</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.540" end="00:19:36.990" style="s2">sort of cross-cultural ways so the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.130" end="00:19:40.260" style="s2">original form of this is don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.990" end="00:19:41.700" style="s2">intoxicants don&#39;t use intoxicants so</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.260" end="00:19:43.190" style="s2">some Buddhists take this very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.700" end="00:19:49.950" style="s2">they won&#39;t even take like an aspirin</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.190" end="00:19:53.820" style="s2">right and there&#39;s a problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.950" end="00:19:57.480" style="s2">because a culture is kind of unclear</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.820" end="00:20:00.510" style="s2">about what we think of intoxication</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.480" end="00:20:03.150" style="s2">itself we of course think we have moral</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.510" end="00:20:05.040" style="s2">criticisms of immoral acts or illegal</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.150" end="00:20:07.230" style="s2">acts committed because of intoxication</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.040" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">but what we&#39;re unsure as a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.230" end="00:20:11.700" style="s2">intoxication itself what is it a good</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:13.800" style="s2">thing is it a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.700" end="00:20:16.500" style="s2">now for those of you are interested I</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.800" end="00:20:18.390" style="s2">have videos on both within the series my</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.500" end="00:20:21.900" style="s2">my channel about altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.390" end="00:20:25.620" style="s2">consciousness okay and so I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.900" end="00:20:28.440" style="s2">to try and give my argument about what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.620" end="00:20:30.360" style="s2">think is a good way of framing them here</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.440" end="00:20:32.850" style="s2">but I do want to say what does the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.360" end="00:20:35.990" style="s2">training precept lead us to well the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.850" end="00:20:40.440" style="s2">training precept leads us to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.990" end="00:20:43.290" style="s2">you can see in organisms that have high</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.440" end="00:20:45.990" style="s2">intelligence that they seek out altered</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.290" end="00:20:47.070" style="s2">states of consciousness and in fact you</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.990" end="00:20:50.610" style="s2">have an altered state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.070" end="00:20:52.860" style="s2">every night you&#39;re dreaming and dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.610" end="00:20:55.170" style="s2">seems to be correlated with how complex</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.860" end="00:20:58.470" style="s2">the cognitive machinery of an organism</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.170" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">is also how much social the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.470" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">complexity of its social networking so</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:05.310" style="s2">dreaming altered states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:07.680" style="s2">and this seems to be the case for many</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.310" end="00:21:11.460" style="s2">altered states of consciousness seem to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.680" end="00:21:14.130" style="s2">be conducive to the way in which higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.460" end="00:21:15.660" style="s2">cognition expands and enriches itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.130" end="00:21:17.580" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;ll see you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.660" end="00:21:19.230" style="s2">Caledonian crows will tumble down a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.580" end="00:21:21.150" style="s2">rooftop to make themselves dizzy because</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.230" end="00:21:23.190" style="s2">they just want to be dizzy or elephants</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.150" end="00:21:25.980" style="s2">will eat fermenting food to get stoned</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.190" end="00:21:28.310" style="s2">right or goats will leave you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.980" end="00:21:31.140" style="s2">coffee beans and get kind of right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.310" end="00:21:32.850" style="s2">intelligent organisms pursue altered</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.140" end="00:21:34.890" style="s2">states of consciousness it&#39;s natural to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.850" end="00:21:37.140" style="s2">us and there&#39;s increasing evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.890" end="00:21:38.460" style="s2">they&#39;re highly functional now precisely</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.140" end="00:21:39.720" style="s2">because they&#39;re highly functional they</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.460" end="00:21:40.740" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be abused</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.720" end="00:21:42.179" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.740" end="00:21:47.250" style="s2">all of these things that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.179" end="00:21:51.150" style="s2">about are really important right places</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.250" end="00:21:54.690" style="s2">low sigh in which your humanity is in</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.150" end="00:21:57.960" style="s2">question and how you act they&#39;re steers</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.690" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">it very very deeply and so the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.960" end="00:22:03.690" style="s2">is how are you pursuing altered states</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:06.290" style="s2">of consciousness because you will you</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.690" end="00:22:08.940" style="s2">will you&#39;ll either do it default</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.290" end="00:22:10.740" style="s2">automatically or you&#39;ll do it work from</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.940" end="00:22:12.800" style="s2">work deliberately but that deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.740" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">might still be in a very risky or</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.800" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">ultimately maladaptive way so think</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:22.679" style="s2">about this what you&#39;re doing right here</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:25.920" style="s2">in this practice is pursuing an altered</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.679" end="00:22:28.350" style="s2">state of consciousness so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.920" end="00:22:31.740" style="s2">understand this so the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.350" end="00:22:33.390" style="s2">again this is precious coin you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.740" end="00:22:38.700" style="s2">seeking of altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.390" end="00:22:41.040" style="s2">consciousness so when you&#39;re seeking an</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.700" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">altered state of consciousness here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.040" end="00:22:45.540" style="s2">the thing to ask yourself what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:46.920" style="s2">principle in mindfulness I&#39;m seeking an</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.540" end="00:22:49.860" style="s2">altered state of consciousness because</p>

<p begin="00:22:52.470" end="00:22:57.960" style="s2">so that I can be more present more</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.609" end="00:42:08.990" style="s2">you ask what more can I see what more</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.240" end="00:42:10.279" style="s2">can I learn of course that might just</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.990" end="00:42:11.960" style="s2">trigger imagery that might just trigger</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.279" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">thoughts but it might because of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.960" end="00:42:15.950" style="s2">practice you just get that you get that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:17.240" style="s2">sort of very pregnant emptiness and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.950" end="00:42:19.039" style="s2">what you want to do is you want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.240" end="00:42:21.650" style="s2">the five hunters and Corrine mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.039" end="00:42:24.380" style="s2">into that pregnant emptiness your mind</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.700" end="00:42:34.549" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s still a temperature to it a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.950" end="00:42:37.730" style="s2">texture a tempo and so you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.549" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">in more into more the the felt aspects</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.730" end="00:42:41.420" style="s2">and notice them the way you notice your</p>

<p begin="00:42:41.420" end="00:42:46.730" style="s2">and explore them as if you were looking</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.329" end="00:42:51.410" style="s2">for a lost object bringing those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.730" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">of skills to bear upon it oh so the last</p>

<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:43:01.880" style="s2">question so I hope that was helpful</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.500" end="00:43:04.640" style="s2">answer for you at Rima so here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.880" end="00:43:06.470" style="s2">question when I&#39;m meditating it feels</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.640" end="00:43:08.359" style="s2">like there&#39;s an imaginary layer of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.470" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">sensations on the front side of my body</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.359" end="00:43:12.559" style="s2">and I have a hard time distinguishing it</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:13.880" style="s2">from physical sensations which should</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.559" end="00:43:16.220" style="s2">what should I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.880" end="00:43:18.200" style="s2">imaginary there is on the front side of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.220" end="00:43:22.700" style="s2">my body so don&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.200" end="00:43:23.960" style="s2">distinguishing it right now unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.700" end="00:43:26.420" style="s2">causing you some sort of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.960" end="00:43:29.869" style="s2">distress because what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.420" end="00:43:31.670" style="s2">happening is you now have sort of some</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.869" end="00:43:34.309" style="s2">pretty good cognitive science about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.670" end="00:43:36.109" style="s2">that imagination and perception aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.309" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">two separate things like we used to</p>
