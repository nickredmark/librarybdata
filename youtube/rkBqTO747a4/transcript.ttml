<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">of doing the cognitive science of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">religion and spirituality and his own</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">research is just taking off</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">and so i&#39;m just really excited to have</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">and with john for nearly a decade now</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">geez let&#39;s not think about that too hard</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">and uh yeah as mentioned my particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">areas of specialty</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:02:00.320" style="s2">are the cognitive science of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:03.920" style="s2">spirituality of religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.320" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">of uh lifespan development um</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.920" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">by and large my own area of research can</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">summarized as the study of intentional</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">so my focus is</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">on ways in which people can change and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">develop</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">on purpose as opposed to you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">psychological growth being something</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">that just happens to you as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">fate or circumstance or accident my</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">interest is in the ways that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">can take charge of their own development</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">this has of course led me through</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">research in mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">research in spiritual practices research</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">magic and mysticism a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">research in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">the martial arts we do need to finish</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">that paper</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">yes and um so that&#39;s where i&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">from all of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">um i think my thinking is i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">50 john&#39;s fault and 50 the fault of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">myriad other influences who i&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">good fortune of being able to study with</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">over the last 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">so it i mean i like i said i think if</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">ginseng more is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">more family um so</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">what i want to talk about uh which is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.159" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">the purview uh voices with vervice the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">is the work so you mentioned a paper you</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">working on which we need to finish a a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">naturalistic account of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">key phenomena or the chief phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">within the internal martial arts and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">uh related healing modalities um</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve done some work with uh michelle i</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">on people&#39;s use of the i ching</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">and you&#39;ve been recently doing quite a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">bit of work</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">on uh what you call the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">science of magic</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">now you don&#39;t mean by magic anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">involving supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">horses i know you have a paper that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">under review right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">i forget which site journal it is uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">that is so that that one&#39;s the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:04.720" style="s2">journal of trans personal psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">actually but um i think the seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.720" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">line of thinking so sure let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">jump right into it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">what do we mean by magic here um the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">seeds of that line of thinking can</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">actually be found in another publication</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">that michelle and i just got accepted in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">the humanistic psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">right which is on the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">psychology of religious experiences</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">so what we do in that paper is we</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">track the phenomenological study of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">religion as compared to the sociological</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">study of religion which is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">more constant through history</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">to shall we say three separate waves you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">original wave at the kind of end of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">19th beginning of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">with william james edwin starbuck</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">and you know some of the actual great</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">original luminaries in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:59.759" style="s2">um then it fades away a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">as experimental behaviors and becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.759" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">dominant paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">um because you know as we reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">it is very difficult to induce a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">religious experience in the laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">you know um we&#39;ve had some success</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">recently with psychedelics inducing</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">mystical experiences but as we get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">in the paper</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">the extent to which those are religious</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">experiences under a strict definition is</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">not clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">right right um and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">there&#39;s also the ironically increasing</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">development of psychology as a science</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">leading to a lack</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">of careful familiarity with</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">philosophical tools religious and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:43.199" style="s2">spiritual literature</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">and the just general toolbox you would</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.199" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">need to actually study a religious</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">um so ironically as a watsonian vision</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">psychological science becomes dominant</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.120" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">degrades rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">we then find that this comes back in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">post-war era with the work of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">young and maslow and the kind of great</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">humanistic existential psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">who start to become a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.000" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">interested in individual experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">actually there&#39;s um somebody uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">points out in one of their books i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">remember who it is off the top of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">head unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">that psychology the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">religion and the psychology of sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">switched places over that 30-year span</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">oh interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">where um you know william james writes</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">an entire</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">classic on the psychology of religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">and two pages on human sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">uh at the dawn of the 20th century but</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">uh kinsey who&#39;s writing in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">40s 50s and 60s period</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">writes you know text after text after</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:07:03.199" style="s2">paper after paper about human sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">and nobody&#39;s talking about religion um</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.199" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">so you know that is yet another boom of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">the psychology of religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">and here you start to see the beginnings</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">of what i think is important to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">understand in any sort of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">science of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">magic or spirituality which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">a decoupling of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:28.560" style="s2">theoretical from the practical um</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.160" style="s2">i&#39;m especially using those terms to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.560" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">hearken back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">james fraser&#39;s uh distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">theoretical magic and practical magic</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">right right where you have your</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">underlying metaphysics and ontology of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">entities at play your</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">explanations of how things work you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">what you would call the language of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">training versus the language of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">right so and you see this earlier</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">in um john dewey&#39;s work uh he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">mention this but it really starts to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">taken up by especially maslow</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">this idea that religion and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">as practices do not require the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">supernatural as a theory to function</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">right right right yes so</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">that&#39;s where you start to see these</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">things kind of peel apart</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">and then we kind of characterize the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">current era of research</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">on mystical experiences and religious</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">as really being defined by that final</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">cleaving</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">between the experience and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">right right right um you know we do get</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:37.519" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">well is this really the right idea can</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.519" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">we actually distinguish experience from</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">um you know i think one of our recent</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">experiments demonstrates pretty handily</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">that that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">tough nut to sell yeah yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">but you know this is this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">where the field is going</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">so when i&#39;m talking about the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">science of magic what i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">looking at how much of the practical</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">of spirituality of religion of magic of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">of all of these practices that have</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">traditionally relied on the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">can we replace their theoretical side</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">with good cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">right right right right right with</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">you know this almost this approach</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">almost gives us a sort of a touring test</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">right where</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:32.120" style="s2">if the idea of a touring test is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">sufficiently advanced artificial</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.120" end="00:09:35.839" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">excuse me if a sufficiently advanced</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.839" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:42.080" style="s2">should be able to perfectly mimic human</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:45.360" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.080" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">then practices</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.360" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">derive from a cognitive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">interpretation of magic</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">right should be able to replicate the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">practices of a traditionally trained</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">magician</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">right right right right yeah um from</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">what i&#39;ve seen that might be a tall</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">order and we might be 40 or 50 years out</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s manageable at some</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">so i like this this move you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">right you know about deeply trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">bridge between cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">and the part of that family</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">mysticism magic religion and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">spirituality that is often</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">the one that is held up as the exemplar</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">of irrational behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">uh kookiness uh superstitious</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">supernatural metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">etc um and so your</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">if if i understand you correctly and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">you know i i read some of your work and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">participate in it with you so i hope i</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">do you march</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">yes yes um you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:45.440" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something analogous to what</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">i tried to do and it&#39;s in the awakening</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.440" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">for the meeting crisis around shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">and try and say without adopting the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">shaman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">metaphysical view can we understand both</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">the phenomenology and the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">of shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the altered states</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">of consciousness why that might</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">healing why it might improve hunting so</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">i take it that you&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">analogous and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">like that and extended from that is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">is that a fair uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:13.279" style="s2">yes i&#39;d say that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">pretty accurate interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.279" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">especially because</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">i think the work on shamanism was kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">of the seed idea for this</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">right right um where you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:27.519" style="s2">history of human spirituality shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">is kind of the the er art the proto art</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">right um it is magic it is spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">it is mysticism it is religion it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">science it is mindfulness all</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">wrapped into this singular bundle of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">kind of original human psychological</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">yeah and as you know i agree with matt</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">rosano</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">and uh michael winkelmann and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">david lewis williams that you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">shamanism is</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">probably the psychotech the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">that really drove uh the huge cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">leap</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">happening in the upper paleolithic</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">transition uh so</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">even though that does not in any way</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">give scientific evidence for the truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">of shamanistic metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">it does say that the phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.680" style="s2">the language of training</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">within chinese is doing very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.680" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">powerful things</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">so can you can you give me an example</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">several examples let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">just go crazy jim son of how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.880" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">bringing this work to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">you know various practices that have</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">been called magical and and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">cog sigh around them</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:35.760" style="s2">sure so oh boy where do we want to start</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.760" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">um i think i think it might be good to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">start historically actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:43.680" style="s2">um to kind of give people a bridge from</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.680" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">into magic and mysticism proper and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">go from there sure please so</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">you know um something that i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">occasionally say to people when they ask</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">me why i&#39;m studying magic is you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">my argument is that magic is a human</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">birthright</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">it is i would say the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">faculty we have that really</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">distinguishes us from the other very</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.440" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">complex tropic animals</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">right right um you know if it is true</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">that shamanism was the driving factor in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">the upper paleolithic revolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">then magic is why humans are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">dominant species on earth</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">um which is going to be a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">sentence</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:33.200" style="s2">for a lot of people listening to this</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">yeah yes but</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.200" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2">hear me out so there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">direct lines to shamanism that you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">find throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">that evolve in one way or another and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">actually i would say you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.519" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">characterize the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">um as essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.519" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">filtering and formalizing of certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">aspects of shamanic psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">relative to the culture that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">revolution is occurring in ah</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">well said so in ancient greece for</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">um you know the sociological pressures i</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">think are very well</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:13.839" style="s2">laid out in awakening from the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.839" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">i won&#39;t go over them here but you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">the powers of watching the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2">of looking for fixed points of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">reasoning and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">symbolism just condensed</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">through uh pythagoras through socrates</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">from the thracian shamanic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">just kind of almost as a series of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">lenses focusing sunlight into something</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">more concentrated and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">not quite as broadly applicable but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:48.399" style="s2">get this very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">psychotechnology that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">excellent at picking up the constants in</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">the natural world right</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">right right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">if you go to india what i think the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">vedas</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">represent is another concentration</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">of shamanic practices but these are the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">shamanic practices</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">for shall we say internal</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">phenomenological manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">right right um you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">yes basically the manipulation of one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">own consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">is kind of the the filtered ability and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">you could even argue</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">that what you get in the abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">is kind of the concentration of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">power of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">narrative from the shamanic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">yeah right right um</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">and china i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.279" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">you know they&#39;re they&#39;re a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">more manifold i think the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">but the psycho technology that i would</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">say is par excellence in china is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">capacity for tracking change</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:54.480" style="s2">right right um you know you get this</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">through the classic of changes you get</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.480" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">this in a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">biodynamic approach to medicine um</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">you get this and it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">to track the evolution of chinese</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">science versus</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">greek science because greek science is</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">very focused on constants in the natural</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.800" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">world whereas chinese science is very</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">focused on dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">all right so you see that even in like</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">the the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">sort of the flow within tai chi chuan</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:25.199" style="s2">yes yes um</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">yeah so i would say you know the ability</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.199" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">to track and effect</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">change is what really goes on</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:34.839" style="s2">in the uh the chinese segment at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">chinese</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.839" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">um the axial revolution in china</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">right so you know the reason why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">going through all of this is because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">do kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">this splitting of the original shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">right into forms of psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">that become</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">shall we say mainstream right right</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">right now this especially becomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">clear in ancient greece and roman europe</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">um but we get the word</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">magic from the greek word</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:13.679" style="s2">for persian especially zoroastrian</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:16.839" style="s2">priests</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.679" end="00:17:21.039" style="s2">right nice so</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.839" end="00:17:25.160" style="s2">the term magic</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.039" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">has its origins in a word meaning the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.160" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">psychotechnologies of the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">right yeah the significant other for</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:37.440" style="s2">greek culture too</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">yes yeah and you know the um</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">in in chinese for example the word for</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">magic and the word for shaman and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">pretty much the same thing um you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">it depends on who you talk to there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">this word for magic that largely means</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">otherworldly there&#39;s also a word for</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:53.650" style="s2">magic that means shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">um but you know basically the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.650" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">the shaman&#39;s tool kit fractures</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">depending on where you go in the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">right and especially in you know greece</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">greek intellectual descendants the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.679" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">non-kosher parts of it shall we say</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:17.919" style="s2">become magic but they&#39;re still part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">this same toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.919" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">right okay that&#39;s why um so</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">when i am referring to magic i am</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">essentially referring to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">the entire toolkit i don&#39;t use the word</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">shamanism because i would</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">reserve the term shamanism to refer to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">very raw form of this toolkit in its</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">original integrated context</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">right right because in the thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">years between</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">shamanism and magic magic gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">right right right right the symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">becomes incredibly diverse</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">incredibly rich incredibly complex the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">rituals diversify and specify</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">you know if you look at um</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">medieval grimoires for example they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">complex instruments right right um</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">and you know the the classic</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:17.120" style="s2">grimoire and this is the case no matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">where you go in the world there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">chinese grimoires there are indian</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">grimoires</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">um currently taking a look at a hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">grimoire which is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">an interesting lark um and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:30.559" style="s2">is kind of why i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:31.000" style="s2">like magic is everywhere magic is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.559" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.000" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">complexified historical descendants of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">ancient shamanic psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">so uh is it fair to say then</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">that there are still sort of broadly</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">given the way you&#39;ve described the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:49.120" style="s2">origin sort of three domains</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">in which we could see sort of psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.120" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">altering states of consciousness kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">coming you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">and in that sense technically</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:19:58.160" style="s2">mindfulness practice would be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">magical practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.160" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">right yes i think mcclellan in his book</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">wisdom of hypatia says that magic is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">art of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">change consciousness at will yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s not wrong actually um</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me this comparison</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">yeah the core disciplines of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">of logic ethics and physics right</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">actually i think make an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">framework to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">split magic right people have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.280" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">logic for the stoics means much more not</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">just what is now logic today i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">much more like psychology</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:37.039" style="s2">yes you know just basic reasoning skills</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.039" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">if you twisted my arm a little bit i</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:43.600" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">that from original shamanic magic</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.600" end="00:20:46.840" style="s2">the greco-roman tradition inherited</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">logic</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.840" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">the uh vedic tradition inherited ethics</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">and the chinese tradition inherited</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">right but what i was going to do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">but i was going to say you these are</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">sort of domains where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">transforming consciousness yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">and domains where you&#39;re trying to pick</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">up on what is most constant</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">unless people think that&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">scientific practice one way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">understanding mysticism is to try and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">get at</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">you know the ground of being the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">ultimate reality which is the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">constant</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">and then you also have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">try and track</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">changes and you know this has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">picked up more recently</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">uh you know in 40 cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">where you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">alicia arrow talks about the use of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">right in order to yes turn your</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">cognition into something like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">dynamical system so you can better track</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">the dynamical systems of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:44.159" style="s2">uh and so um is that a fair way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">parsing it so</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.159" end="00:21:47.360" style="s2">that you could look at sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">psychotech for sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">tracking dynamical systems psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">for transforming consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">and then psychotech for trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">sort of what is most constant</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">in reality is that is that fair yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">yeah i i&#39;d say that&#39;s fair and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:04.640" style="s2">you find forms of magic that work for</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">all of them like every magical tradition</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.640" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">contains a meditative tradition</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:11.360" style="s2">yeah um in terms of just trying to kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.600" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">of ground out your own</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.360" end="00:22:15.600" style="s2">um ground out your own issues but then</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.600" end="00:22:19.000" style="s2">divination for tracking patterns there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.000" end="00:22:23.919" style="s2">fantastic project going on at harvard</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">that they call predictionx</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:29.919" style="s2">which is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">collate and systematize every way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.919" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">humans have ever tried to predict the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">and it goes all the way from babylonian</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">horror spiky</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">all the way to modern stats right right</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">and i just love seeing the things just</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">put on the same graph</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">because they&#39;re completely right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">all we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">so this picks up on sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:53.919" style="s2">predictive processing um</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">yeah and you know you and daniel thank</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.919" end="00:22:58.000" style="s2">you greg you have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">talking about that um yes um what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.000" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">doing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">so the the way that i would um</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:05.919" style="s2">kind of build on that other definition</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">of magic as the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.919" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">kind of change consciousness at will is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">magic by and large is using techniques</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">of imagination to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">bootstrap powers of cognition yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">i think that is very well said</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">and that goes well with the predictive</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:24.080" style="s2">processing model because it sees</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">imagination basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">as the top-down predictive aspect and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">and and sensation of perception is sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">of the bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">yes yeah well and you know and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">why i think we&#39;ve had this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">i think we need to go back to a more</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">way of looking at the imagination yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">you know the senses do not integrate in</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">and of themselves you have this</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">what they refer to as the common sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">yes that sticks them all together</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:53.600" style="s2">but you have control over that common</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">sense so you can stick senses together</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.600" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">in all sorts of ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">so that uh look getting disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">that you could train to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">transform</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">that common sense would then impact on</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">the kinds of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">you were able to pick up on within</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">yourself within others and within the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">um and and make and and sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">couple to the world in more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">ways is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">also a way of understanding what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">talking about here yes absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard me talk about this before</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">you can only process things you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">right yeah so the more limited you are</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">in scope of your imagination ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">the less</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">rational you are yes i agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.279" end="00:24:39.760" style="s2">and you know people like to rag on</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">practices of imagination as being</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.760" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">irrational and fancy and things like</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a little bit like saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">going to the gym</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">is an artificial recreation of tasks you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">will actually have to perform in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s true you still go to the gym</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">because it expands your base capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:02.320" style="s2">do things in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">right right so that that that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.320" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">yeah i like the gem or or the dojo</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">analogy uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">so well that sort of segues into what i</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">wanted to ask you which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">probably watching this and they have</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">knives out</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">um and they&#39;re they&#39;re looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">indiana</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">in any way i mean there&#39;s two groups</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s the people who are sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">uh are self-designated as being rational</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">um and then you said there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">important relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">between imagination and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:37.039" style="s2">and i like i&#39;ve said before i think both</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">the calvinist and the romantic</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.039" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">understanding of imagination are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">are defective by</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">being different kinds of extremes uh so</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">i can see</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">right that the rationalist coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">saying that this is all just</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">superstitious crap</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">and then i can hear religious people</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">coming in and saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">this is all just heresy uh et cetera et</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">cetera</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s do the first group first</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:01.919" style="s2">because i think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">um like a lot i mean that i i know</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.919" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">you&#39;re respectful of religious</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:05.279" style="s2">traditions but</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">i can tell in a lot of the work you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.279" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">really wrestling with those who come in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">uh uh it&#39;s like i said self-designated</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">as the defenders of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">um and say you&#39;re why are you doing this</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">this is all just</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">there&#39;s one there&#39;s a simple explanation</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">for all of this which is people are just</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">superstitious and irrational</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">and that if they were just rational and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">usually the implicit</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">thing is rational like me uh then you we</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">we we</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">need to do any of this but you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">trying to show um first of all how</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">pervasive it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">and how functional it is and that like</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">you said it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">understand the functionality without</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">committing to the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">so like i said can you give us some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">those arguments</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">so i think my first argument to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">skeptic as far as rationality goes</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">is it&#39;s not going away</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">yeah you know this is if you read the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:02.799" style="s2">works of rossano</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">of winkelmann of tanya lerman um</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.799" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">you know uh actually most of whom i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">met and are all fantastic people</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.400" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">yes um sorry just at a weird point in my</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">um this is just part of human makeup and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">if you read uh jason josephsome storm</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">has a fantastic book</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">called the myth of disenchant right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">i will yet again say</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">uh jason joseph storm has one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:28.000" style="s2">best names i&#39;ve ever heard</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.840" end="00:27:29.360" style="s2">yes um it&#39;s a fantastic name for a guy</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.000" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">who studies magic</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.360" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">anyway his point is that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">like to pretend we are living in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">world of disenchantment you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">post uh weber&#39;s whole point about</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">uh the great disenchantment and things</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">like that which i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">you refer to as the disembedding because</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">they&#39;re functionally the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">right yes um and joseph storm&#39;s point is</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">no we&#39;re not if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">statistics of who believes in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:03.440" style="s2">supernatural who believes</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">in um esp who believes in aliens and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.440" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">proportions have not changed in over a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">science is great but you know magic has</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">always existed in the cracks</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">um actually i think my favorite finding</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">of his</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">is that who believes</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">like the proportion of the population</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">that believes in one thing versus</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">another thing has not changed in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">last couple of hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">but what&#39;s funny to him is that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">belief systems are mutually exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.559" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">for example people who believe in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">psychics do not believe in witches</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">that&#39;s i didn&#39;t know that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.200" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">interesting well because</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">basically the argument is that like</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">these people have constructed a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">system to explain</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">how these things work and like i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">looked at</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">uh the the esp kind of framework um</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:03.840" style="s2">you know i prefer the magic framework</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">because it&#39;s older and has a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.840" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">more generalizability</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:10.720" style="s2">but yeah if you believe in uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">people who are psychokinetic you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.720" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">need magic</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">it&#39;s all psychokinesis um</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">meanwhile if you believe in magic you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">don&#39;t need psychokinesis it&#39;s all magic</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">um so the reason why i start there</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">is because you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">let&#39;s be honest you know humans are not</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">born inherently rational</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">um at least not the way that people tend</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">to use that word</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">what people are born with is a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">for utilitarian pattern funding right</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">so you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">what all of these people who believe in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">some supernatural thing or another</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">are doing is they are having experiences</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">that science does not do a very good job</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">of explaining or addressing</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">and they are attempting to patch them</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:09.279" style="s2">into a world view right</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">now what because i&#39;ve even encountered</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.279" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">scientists who are like</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know man i found this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">um you know part of scientific training</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">is the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">sit with doubt and mystery um</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m not knocking that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">knocking scientific training i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">it&#39;s important i&#39;ve got 10 years of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">yeah um you know 10 years of it under a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">very good teacher</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">this isn&#39;t me saying that superstition</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:42.399" style="s2">or the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">is necessary it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">me saying that it&#39;s an understandable</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">part of people trying to figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">way to actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">live and work and act in the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.039" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">one of the things you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:57.519" style="s2">just have pure language of training</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">right you have to have some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.519" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">language of explanation</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">right right and right</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d say the biggest issue is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">you know um michelle</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">my you know supervisor on paper um</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">he&#39;s a big believer in what william</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:21.919" style="s2">james referred to as radical empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">yeah if a human can experience it you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.919" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">must be able to study it</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">right no there has to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:29.519" style="s2">underlying systematicity to human</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.519" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">even if the way that a human experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">something is completely non-replicable</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">right right like you know the uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">of identity being a thing it could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">that there are there is no plausible way</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">that anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">will ever have this like one experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">um my dad was telling me his story cause</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">he&#39;s a big baseball fan</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">of uh this guy who he</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">hit the ball and it lined up just</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.760" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">perfectly so that a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">bird flew in front of the ball right as</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">it was going down the pitch and you just</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">see this explosion of feathers</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">as the universe lines up just right for</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">this ball to hit the bird</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">that&#39;s never going to happen again but</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">under the laws of physics it</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:20.399" style="s2">can happen so james&#39;s argument is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">even if it&#39;s never going to happen again</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.399" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">under the laws governing human</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:26.240" style="s2">experience it is clearly possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:28.240" style="s2">for it to happen so therefore we must be</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.240" end="00:32:29.519" style="s2">able to understand it somehow</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.240" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">if we want to assume there&#39;s some sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:34.559" style="s2">of systematicity and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">i do have to say mainstream science does</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.559" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">a terrible job</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">at cleaving to that kind of a thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">a lot of academics a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">claim to be rational</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">and i will say claim to be because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">know i</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">do believe that you need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">sufficiently powerful imagination in</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">order to be properly rational</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">because otherwise you&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">world with one eye shot yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:00.399" style="s2">so you know and you know we know this</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">people are not good judges of their own</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.399" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">rationality</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:08.840" style="s2">yes yes um so</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">you know i guess my rebuttal to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">pseudo-rationalists is twofold one</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">is the practical consideration</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">of people are having experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:23.519" style="s2">systematically track something you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:25.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">uh all the wiccans that i&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.360" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">like you know they do the rituals and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:32.000" style="s2">something happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">right um and you know i&#39;ve um</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">been hanging out with a sufi group for</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">part of the last year and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a very powerful experience and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">yes you do experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">something yes and uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:45.279" style="s2">you know they need to have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">system to put it all in because</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.279" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">otherwise how do you share it</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">and the second part of my rebuttal is</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">if your argument that something is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">rational is that you have not personally</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">experienced it nor can you conceive of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">it happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">that is a poor argument yes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">world is huge people are diverse people</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">are capable of having all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">experiences that you will never have</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">so so that&#39;s that&#39;s good um</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">so a third argument i want you to apply</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:22.159" style="s2">to is</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">yeah but the only reason this persists</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.159" end="00:34:26.480" style="s2">is just because people are persistently</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">stupid and irrational</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.480" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">and i get it that&#39;s still question</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">begging because of your previous two</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">arguments</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:33.839" style="s2">but i think you also have an independent</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">response to that you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.839" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">well there&#39;s another explanation for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">persistence i don&#39;t think you deny that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:40.079" style="s2">there&#39;s some self-deception going on in</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.040" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">these things and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">people are playing power politics and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:46.839" style="s2">doing all the all all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">with oh absolutely and people do that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.839" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">science people do mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:51.599" style="s2">science people do that in art people do</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">that in politics so sometimes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.599" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">let&#39;s just acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">self-deception is random okay putting</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">that aside</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:59.440" style="s2">you you say yeah independent of that i</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">think you say</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.440" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">there&#39;s another uh important</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">reason for the persistence of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:09.599" style="s2">you&#39;re calling magic</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">namely is it has important functionality</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.599" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">it transforms people it enables them to</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:15.839" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">it enables them to aspire it enables</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.839" end="00:35:19.280" style="s2">them to access</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">aspects of the psyche or their own body</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.280" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">or psychosomatic interaction</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">sorry i apologize i might have left that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">implicit in my previous answers but</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">the bottom line is this stuff works</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">yeah um it may not work in the exact</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">way that the metaphysics that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">holding up says because you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">known since the 1950s from arthur</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">rieber&#39;s work that people cannot explain</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">their own pattern finding</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah they cannot it does not</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.040" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">matter how rational you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">you cannot explain your own pattern</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.680" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">finding um i</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">am sure with a sufficient amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">and training you might be able to do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">but people are just bad at it um so</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:03.839" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s yeah let&#39;s forgive that as</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.839" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">part of human psychology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">unfortunately slightly unavoidable</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">and let&#39;s be a little charitable and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">point out people do not</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">keep things that do not work right um or</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">at least</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">let me rephrase that people do not keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">things that do not</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">perform some sort of a function</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">right even if that function is just</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">nostalgia</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">um so you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">we&#39;re finding increasingly like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">cleaving off pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">shamanism and magic and turning them</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">into clinical psychology</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">over and over and over again you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">we&#39;re taking psychedelics we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">ritual we&#39;re taking you know mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">practices and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">right right every time we have taken</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">something from</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">magic and changed its metaphysics into</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">suddenly it works yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">hear me out it&#39;s not the change in</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">metaphysics that&#39;s making it work</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">yes yes very well said very well said</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">uh although perhaps the change in</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">metaphysics this is going to be a segway</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">to my last</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">next question allows you to bring</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">science to bear and perhaps reverse</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">engineer or improve it</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">to some degree yes and so you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:20.839" style="s2">i&#39;ve joked about this for years where my</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">entire tagline is sufficiently analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.839" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">magic</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:25.839" style="s2">so this this brings me to the question</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">which is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.839" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">out i mean i know this from your work</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">but just so just to give you an opening</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">like so cognitive science especially for</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">e-cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">plays a special role in doing that in</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">you know in re-situating</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:43.280" style="s2">these practices and explaining their</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">functionality and perhaps affording</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.280" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">in enhancing uh their functionality so</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">can you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">about that please so so this will</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:51.280" style="s2">actually require me to backtrack a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">little bit because</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.280" end="00:37:54.480" style="s2">um sometimes it is the change in</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">metaphysics that allows it to work</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.480" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">um actually the the first publication</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">that i was ever on</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">was on um</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">the influences of the prosperity gospel</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.520" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">on risk-taking behavior</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">right right right and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">findings</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">particularly sticks out to me um</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:15.839" style="s2">and you know i i thought this was clever</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">on behalf of the first author</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.839" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">uh nick hobson who he he studies ritual</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">uh he&#39;s a good guy um</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">anyway the finding was so you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">we uh well i i helped mostly with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">theory bit so during data collection</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">participants were exposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">clip of joel osteen preaching the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">prosperity gospel</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">and you know lo and behold they found</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">that okay um</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">you know exposure to hearing the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:49.440" style="s2">prosperity gospel makes people</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">indulge in risk-taking behaviors as um</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.440" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">you know tested through a gambling task</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:55.839" style="s2">does that mean that they have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">explicitly believe in</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.839" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">the sort of so here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">is they did this in a follow-up study</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.520" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">where they split it into</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">atheists and theists right and then made</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.079" end="00:39:13.839" style="s2">two versions of the recording</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">one of them was the original recording</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.839" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">and the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">was the recording scrubbed of any</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">mentions of god or the bible or what</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">have you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">right um you know original recording was</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">you know preacher uh giving a sermon and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">the scrubbed recording was designated as</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">motivational speaker giving a talk right</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">here&#39;s the kicker if you scrub</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">everything out of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:40.880" style="s2">uh you know if you scrub god in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:42.310" style="s2">bible out of the recording it works on</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">atheists</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.310" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">there was an amplified effect for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">prosperity gospel and theists</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">suggesting that there is more of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">buy-in effect the more you buy into it</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">right right but you know this is where i</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.280" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">do kind of have to backtrack on</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">my own it&#39;s not the change in</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">metaphysics that makes the thing work</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">but it is the change in metaphysics that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">makes the thing accessible which is what</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">allows it to work</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">ah that&#39;s better that&#39;s much more um</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">precise</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">and helpful thank you so the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">um there you might we might even think</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">this is just occurring to me now the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">metaphysics has sort of an explaining</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:24.640" style="s2">but it also has this new function you</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">mentioned it gives you an accessibility</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.640" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:30.079" style="s2">it allows you to access the pro the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">practice from your particular world view</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.079" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">is that yeah that&#39;s interesting i hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">thought about that so there might be</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">three languages there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">language of training</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">there might be a language of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:39.440" style="s2">and then there might be a language of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">accessing</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.440" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">or making it accessible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">interesting well there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">perspectival language right</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">right yeah participatory perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">language yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">underneath all of this you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">the basic way in which you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:56.560" style="s2">the world that allows certain things to</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">be possible versus impossible</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.560" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">right just the basic filter of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:01.839" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">right needs to be set up in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.839" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">way right now</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">granted you know it&#39;s uh one of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">things where i know anderson does this a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">lot and i&#39;ve gotten into it you need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">learn to play with your own metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">of what&#39;s possible versus impossible</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:17.920" style="s2">right um you know if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">certain grounding practices and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.920" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">unfortunately not to get political or</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">anything but</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">not interrogating your own world view is</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">what allows people to be manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">um yeah yeah you know especially through</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">conspiracy theories and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:35.040" style="s2">right because if you look historically</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">um part of the proper</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.040" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">education of a shaman or a magician or a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">spiritualist or anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">is learning to warp your own field of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:45.760" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">and find your way back right right you</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">back bit that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:52.400" style="s2">and you know this is why you find a</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">because you need a grounding practice to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">be able to find your way back to reality</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">or at least whatever reality you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">so that&#39;s good could you give another</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">example perhaps the work you did with</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:07.359" style="s2">michelle</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">like on the eye chain or the work you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">about science can explain these</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">explain both the phenomenology and the</p>

<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">in an integrated fashion sure um so</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">actually let&#39;s let&#39;s do the iching one</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">just because that&#39;s top of mind and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s a classic example of magic</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">that everybody wants to dismiss out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">that they can&#39;t dismiss out of hand for</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">two reasons one they don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:33.599" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">and two they don&#39;t know how it works</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.599" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">so the i ching is probably going to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">heard properly the eating is</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.599" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">going to be familiar to most people as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">manual of chinese fortune telling</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">um very famously translated by wilhelm</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">and baines and commented on by young</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">the jungian commentary is terrible um</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">you know i say this with all due respect</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">he was a psychologist bound to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">place in time did not have certain</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">resources available to him</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">but um you know i</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">speak like kindergarten first grade</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:11.920" style="s2">mandarin and read classical chinese</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">decently due</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.920" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">to having an education in chinese</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">one of our co-authors my lab mate anne</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">is fluent</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">so we were able to actually access the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">classical chinese sources</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.359" end="00:43:28.319" style="s2">and young&#39;s commentary does not hold up</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">if you look at the classical literature</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">anyway so but the operative you know we</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">kind of used the itching uh the aging as</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">a lens because</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">it was convenient and interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">that&#39;s what we had access to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.680" style="s2">but the argument works for all forms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">divination so</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.680" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">first things first fortune telling does</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">not do what you think it does</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">um and you know this is uh i&#39;ve studied</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">with the wicked church of canada for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">last year as well to kind of get the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">emic understanding on magic as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">right and they are also very clear on</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.240" style="s2">divination does not tell you the check</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">is going to be in the mail next tuesday</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.240" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">right um what</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">divination does and this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:14.400" style="s2">uh this is a difficulty thing to explain</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">outside of either chinese or neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.400" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">but most magical systems</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:23.920" style="s2">look at the natural order of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">life fate the universe the planet and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.920" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">things like this as kind of an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:30.560" style="s2">river</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:32.240" style="s2">individual human choices can vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.560" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">shape the flow of the river</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">but you know ultimately a river flows</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">one way</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">right what divination</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">practices allow you to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">is gauge what&#39;s happening downstream</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">um especially practices like tarot card</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">reading or itching divination</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">are essentially acts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">i find myself at a crossroads i could</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">act this way or i could act this way</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">assuming i act in one particular way</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">what kind of consequences am i looking</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">at downstream</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:08.319" style="s2">what do i need to avoid what could</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:09.680" style="s2">possibly come up</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.319" end="00:45:11.599" style="s2">things like this like the itching is</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.680" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">especially full of this because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.599" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">readings are things like you know well</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">superior a superior person would do this</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">a foolish person is going to have this</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">happen to them don&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:25.440" style="s2">right um so and the wiccans especially</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">are very clear on never ask divination</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">for specifics never go</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">fishing in a divinatory system it</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">um so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">so how does it work then like i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">scientific terms because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.119" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do here</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">so let&#39;s go back to that reaper stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">that we were talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">right so we know that people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">terrible at</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">you know gauging their own pattern</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:51.040" style="s2">recognition right you know what people</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">are not terrible at</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.040" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">pattern recognition itself right uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:46:00.640" style="s2">people are fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">at finding hidden patterns yes um and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.640" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">you know unfortunately this has ruined a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">lot of research in the past right like</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">any sort of pattern in your randomized</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">scheme people will find it</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">we found this with the blind site</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">research you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">um all sorts of things humans are</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">fantastic at implicit pattern</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">recognition i</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:19.359" style="s2">doubt there is anything on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.800" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">that is better than we are right</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">um implicit meaning that they can detect</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">and this is what reverse show</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">they can pick up very complex patterns</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">without being aware that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.720" end="00:46:29.760" style="s2">so or knowing how they do so</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">even if they become aware that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.760" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">doing so right</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">you know this is just a thing we do as</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">humans right</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">now let&#39;s say we&#39;re back in the day</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:42.400" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have modern statistical</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">software</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">or things like that to do your</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">prediction</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">right the human faculty for implicit</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">is your best tool for predicting the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">future in fact arguably that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">for you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">um the two hunting strategies that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">humans developed</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">both necessitate the capacity to predict</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">right because our hunting strategies are</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">chase something until it dies of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">exhaustion</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">right so we need to predict where the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">thing is going or</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">throw rocket moving target which also</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">requires our ability to predict where</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">the thing is going so basically this</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:19.359" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">is very very well developed for</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.359" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">predicting future events</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">right um you know this is hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">telling this you know predicting the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:31.599" style="s2">weather this is basic if this then that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">right right and what reaper showed is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.599" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">that we do this on a level so implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:39.200" style="s2">that we can&#39;t actually figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">the heck we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.200" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">skip to the work of keith oatley which</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:45.599" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">he looks at narrative as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.599" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">modeling software</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">right right so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:54.640" style="s2">read fiction and it allows you to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">know practice that kind of predictive</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.640" end="00:47:58.319" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">right so fiction i mean in that sense is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.319" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">part of what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">this training of the imaginable faculty</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">i mean one of the reasons why we read</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:06.400" style="s2">great literature</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">is it trains our imagination so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.400" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">much better at understanding other</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">picking up our patterns intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">about how they&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">around in the world what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">thinking what they&#39;re seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">they&#39;re believing but people don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:20.240" style="s2">people don&#39;t just they just don&#39;t label</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">that as magic</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.240" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">no they don&#39;t they should but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">you know especially because if and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">here&#39;s where we&#39;ll get into things</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">the purpose of a divination system</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">is to create an</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">artificial grammar right um you know and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:45.040" style="s2">this is one of the reasons why i</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:46.559" style="s2">rag on astrology a little bit because it</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.040" end="00:48:47.920" style="s2">requires a reach to construct an</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.559" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">artificial grammar because part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.920" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">point is that it needs to be randomized</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">and astrology is a closed system i kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">of treat astrology as the magical</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">equivalent of genetics</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">um yeah anyway so what you&#39;re doing when</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">you&#39;re casting lots or drawing cards or</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">is you are creating an</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">artificial randomized symbolic grammar</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">which allows you to you know when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">describing this in light persons terms i</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">describe it as fly paper for thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">right um you know this is a fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.839" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">instrument unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">it is notoriously fickle it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">um this is why people meditate right</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">think about pink elephants and think</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">about nothing but pink elephants for</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">the next five minutes it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">possible yeah um not without</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">massive powers of concentration that</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">take decades to train</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">so what you&#39;re doing with a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">divination tool is you are creating a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">structure out there in the world to</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">project your imagination onto</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">so that you can bootstrap the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">association game that your brain plays</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">everything to project narrative order</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">onto your implicit pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">right and this well and and then aliso</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">gerardo also talks about</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">how narrative gets our mind working in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">way that&#39;s very good at picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">complex dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">because of the way narrative you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">layers things and has those</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">you know uh feedback and small</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">differences and context sensitivity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">blah blah blah blah blah yes so you get</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">to use</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">basically what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">bootstrapping a few different things</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">here you&#39;re bootstrapping</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">basic complex pattern recognition right</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">narrative processing which allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">massively accelerate the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">complexity of the information that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:47.119" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">right and symbolism right and i think as</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.119" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve discussed in other videos</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">symbols are very powerful because they</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.800" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">allow you a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">complex multi-apt thing to stick pieces</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">of cognition to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">yeah so they don&#39;t have to carry them</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">around in your head yes right</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:04.319" style="s2">that&#39;s right so and you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">ritual element to divination as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.319" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">um and you know this is where</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">traditional wiccan literature and nick</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">hobson&#39;s work overlap</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">is the thing that ritual is fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">for is regulating emotion and shaping</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">intent</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">right which also then impacts on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">even the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">the bioenergetic aspects of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">i wanted to ask you about the randomness</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">you and i have done related work on this</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:33.119" style="s2">too i mean israel reminds me of you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">uh and daniel talks about this too and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.119" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">talk about it too</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:37.280" style="s2">you know the disruptive strategies for</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:38.960" style="s2">inducing insight or yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.280" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">or in neural networks how you throw</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.960" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">noise into the system</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">uh so you prevent it from overfitting so</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">if you use your kind of language</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">you you open up the the space of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:52.400" style="s2">that you can yes yeah it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">basically there&#39;s both a selective</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">constraint and an enabling constraint</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.359" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">in the process of divination there is an</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.359" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">enabling constraint that</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">massively expands the number of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">that you can possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">processing once right um and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">uh certain like certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">meditation they teach you to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">like let go</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">of the grip that you&#39;ve got in your</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">reasoning so active imagination</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:20.319" style="s2">essentially gets massively accelerated</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">um you know the symbols having</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.319" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">uh fluid meanings rather than strictly</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">defined fixed meanings also has an</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">impact on this</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:34.000" style="s2">semiotic drift yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">randomized element and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.000" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">the ritual setting creates a</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.040" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">selective constraint on the divination</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">process so it&#39;s basically kind of one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">those like</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:45.920" style="s2">you know let&#39;s say that you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:47.520" style="s2">normally come up with three patterns</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.920" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">select one right</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.520" end="00:52:53.119" style="s2">um what divination allows you to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:54.400" style="s2">is instead of going you know draw three</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:57.839" style="s2">pick one</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.400" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s draw ten pick four right right</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">right right right</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">right so it&#39;s you know a basic strategy</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">for massively expanding the number of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:10.559" style="s2">patterns that you can hold at once</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:12.400" style="s2">and artificially constraining the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.559" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">selection process</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.400" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">so that you don&#39;t go essentially</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">um you know essentially so you don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">into choice paralysis</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">so i mean using sort of a mcgilcus</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">language you&#39;re doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">you know really enhancing a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">shifting between left and right</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:33.520" style="s2">yes and you know we know that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">happens with</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.520" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">literacy anyway right yeah um you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:41.920" style="s2">tarot cards are words let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.000" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">let&#39;s put it that way or at the very</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.920" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">least they are both under the subset of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:48.079" style="s2">symbol that require and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:51.680" style="s2">read tarot cards in a very similar way</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.079" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">that you read words on a page right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.680" end="00:53:55.920" style="s2">you know you read the itching the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:57.359" style="s2">way where you do have to kind of do this</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.920" end="00:53:59.920" style="s2">dynamical back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.359" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">between individual symbolism at an</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">individual level and symbolism in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">contextual level</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">so this reminds me of stuff from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">neoplaton tradition like you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve read it too uh gregory shaw&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">work on their gear</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">yes right and the symptomatic practices</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:16.480" style="s2">where they would be given</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">sets of objects and then they had to try</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.480" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">and find the symptomata</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">the pattern that they all like they all</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">symbolically belong to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">and so yes and then you what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:27.680" style="s2">increase the variation</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">and then people and and and this reminds</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.680" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">me and</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">you know where i&#39;m going this reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">of sort of the deep learning strategy in</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">neural networks</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">where you introduce variation and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:38.559" style="s2">you try and find the underlying pattern</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">that&#39;s invariant and then from that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.559" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">introduce there and this is how the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.839" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">brain actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">learns and how artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">so yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">so and this is also why if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">medieval grimoires</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">right the section of the text that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:55.839" style="s2">not specific spell formulae</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">which by the way um i once heard spell</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">formula i described as synesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">equations and that is essentially what</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">right um there is somebody yeah there is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:07.200" style="s2">somebody in the itching literature who</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:10.319" style="s2">has described the iching as</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.200" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">qualitative binary notation</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">um which i think is correct right</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">basically what you do is you form a</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">synesthetic association between</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">symbols and certain qualities and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:21.520" style="s2">symbolism allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">rearrange especially if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.520" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">particularly powerful imagination</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">allows you to rearrange you know certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">quality sensations emotions feeling</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:32.160" style="s2">so that you know okay based on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:34.799" style="s2">grammar of the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.160" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">this is the state that i need to be in</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.799" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">in order to achieve this thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:40.160" style="s2">um but it will dispose itself in</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:42.079" style="s2">different ways is that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.160" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">yeah yeah sorry but what i was</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.079" end="00:55:46.640" style="s2">originally saying is the section of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">um spellbooks that are not those</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:50.480" style="s2">formulae</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.599" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">are giant correspondence and association</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.480" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">right right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">because they basically they allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">make more and more and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">associations based on increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">subtle or occulted symbolism um</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:05.599" style="s2">by the way if this sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">children&#39;s game um</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.599" end="00:56:09.599" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve had this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">before there is a reason</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.599" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">so many tests of cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">look like children&#39;s games</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:18.000" style="s2">yeah yeah um because children are way</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">more flexible than an adult is ever</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.000" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">going to be and you need</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:22.960" style="s2">constant practice in order to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">that flexibility so</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.960" end="00:56:27.119" style="s2">the itunes then using this language uses</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:30.160" style="s2">sort of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.119" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">intervention psychotech to massively</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.160" end="00:56:34.000" style="s2">increase cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">right but in this like you say in this</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.000" end="00:56:38.079" style="s2">systematic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.359" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">and this allows people to better like</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.079" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">tap</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">into their capacity to tap in</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">exact and improve their capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">picking up on implicit patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.880" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">sort of divine like the the course</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">or something like that yes now</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:56.559" style="s2">of course it is kind of one of those</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:58.480" style="s2">things where you know you talk about an</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.559" end="00:57:01.839" style="s2">ecology of practice a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.480" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">yeah the reason why like even within a</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.839" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">divination practice there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:06.880" style="s2">things going on right</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.640" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">right there is you know you&#39;re usually</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.880" end="00:57:11.839" style="s2">supposed to meditate a little bit before</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">you engage in divination um the wiccans</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.839" end="00:57:15.200" style="s2">especially have a code of ethics where</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">there is no divination without</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.200" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:21.760" style="s2">um you do not employ magic until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">at the end of your cognitive rope</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.760" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">right right right um because you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:29.520" style="s2">if this sounds like a recipe for</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:32.799" style="s2">potentially going insane</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.520" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">that&#39;s because it is right um</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.799" end="00:57:36.640" style="s2">you know as we talked about i just want</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">to do your slogan because i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.640" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">really good one</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">you talk about how magic is a tool it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">not a toy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">you know i&#39;ll say a lot rule number one</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">magic is not a toy</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">um rule number two is magic and money</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:50.079" style="s2">don&#39;t mix</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:53.839" style="s2">yeah um but you know rule number one is</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.079" end="00:57:54.640" style="s2">magic is not a toy because you are</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.839" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">playing</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.640" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">with very very old very very fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:01.680" style="s2">psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">for manipulating your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.680" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">perceive and predict</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:10.960" style="s2">patterns in the world yes um this can</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:12.559" style="s2">very readily either</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.960" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">essentially paralyze you for life with</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.559" end="00:58:17.599" style="s2">choice paralysis as you see</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">everything um you know or you just start</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.599" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">seeing things that aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah so i mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">uh and i mentioned theater from the new</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:28.160" style="s2">platonic traditions is you see</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">you see this i mean so the pairing</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.160" end="00:58:30.640" style="s2">between theorgy and philosophia you see</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.640" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">you know that you all you have both</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">these ritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:40.880" style="s2">and then you have these practices that</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">are uh designed to train rationality in</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">clear is what the sense of spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.040" end="01:00:29.920" style="s2">tracks</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:32.720" style="s2">is your sense of connectedness to</p>

<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">both craft and</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.319" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">feeling it is the feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">connectedness of pattern of things</p>

<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">as well as the craft of being able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.720" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">bring about that feeling</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:05.680" style="s2">right right right that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">interesting i was just going to point</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.680" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">people to</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to have brian on it</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">sometime but we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">work with you know discussion with brian</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">ostepan and he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:16.640" style="s2">doing some experiments about how awe</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">really improves</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.640" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">uh sort of your cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:22.880" style="s2">your ability to pick up on patterns</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:24.559" style="s2">uh yes and then you and i uh with</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.880" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">jennifer stellar and with michelle</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.559" end="01:01:28.559" style="s2">we&#39;re crafting an experiment to see uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">where we&#39;re predicting that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">to see that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">ah has important beneficial effects</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:35.119" style="s2">which makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">because we experience awe as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.119" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">tremendously rewarding</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">experience people will often designate</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.400" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">it as one of the most significant</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:43.839" style="s2">experiences of their lives</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:45.119" style="s2">and you know that this is if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.839" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">forgive me for interrupting</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.119" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">one of the things that so frustrates me</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:51.680" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">scientists in general is if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.680" end="01:01:54.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:55.200" style="s2">original intention behind the study of</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.559" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.200" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">in the hellenistic world</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:01.440" style="s2">and you know let&#39;s do my favorite thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:03.839" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.440" end="01:02:05.440" style="s2">hop continents because this is how you</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.839" end="01:02:07.520" style="s2">see that something is real</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.440" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">neoconfusions have the very similar</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.520" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">practice the entire point</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">of what the neoconfusion is called</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">invest the investigation of things or</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.240" end="01:02:19.839" style="s2">you know um physics in the west what</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">the thing that eventually turned into</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.839" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">science and natural observation</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.000" end="01:02:27.520" style="s2">the point is awe right</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">the point is not to do in the wizard and</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.520" end="01:02:30.720" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">not you know measure the marigolds and</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.720" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">the point is to encounter the sheer</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.520" end="01:02:39.280" style="s2">size and scope of everything and just</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">let it open you</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.280" end="01:02:44.400" style="s2">yeah um and this is why i would say you</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:45.440" style="s2">know you have to</p>

<p begin="01:02:45.440" end="01:02:49.359" style="s2">spirituality i think if</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.680" end="01:02:50.880" style="s2">and you know this this gets me in</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.359" end="01:02:51.680" style="s2">trouble with colleagues sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.880" end="01:02:54.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.680" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">um i do treat science as sacred in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.000" end="01:02:59.599" style="s2">very old sense of the word</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.920" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">yes yes um yes i wonder where i got that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.599" end="01:03:04.480" style="s2">one from</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.359" end="01:03:10.720" style="s2">work that daniel&#39;s doing and the work</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.720" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">that anderson anderson todd&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.720" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">uh a bunch of we talk about this</p>

<p begin="01:03:50.960" end="01:03:54.559" style="s2">and essentially you know are things like</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.799" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">wisdom and self-transcendence things</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.559" end="01:03:59.760" style="s2">that you pursue on purpose</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:04:02.799" style="s2">or does you know having a more</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.760" end="01:04:05.760" style="s2">coherent purposeful approach</p>

<p begin="01:04:06.880" end="01:04:10.319" style="s2">right um and of course can we affect</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.799" end="01:04:12.319" style="s2">that in the classroom can we affect that</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.319" end="01:04:15.680" style="s2">in workshops things like that</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.319" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">right um but you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.680" end="01:04:21.280" style="s2">goal kind of going forward is okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.039" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">but you know how does the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.280" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">realness</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">fit into this right like yes yes um you</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.960" end="01:04:28.720" style="s2">know if</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">because what we&#39;re finding is um you</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.720" end="01:04:31.119" style="s2">know the first wave of my thesis</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:35.119" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.119" end="01:04:37.760" style="s2">kind of found actually that the 3dws</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.119" end="01:04:40.160" style="s2">monica&#39;s version of personal wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.760" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">the swis igor&#39;s version of wise</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.160" end="01:04:42.559" style="s2">reasoning</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.119" end="01:04:44.240" style="s2">seem to be tracking two different</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.559" end="01:04:47.280" style="s2">narratives regarding wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.240" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">right um if you consider wisdom as</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.280" end="01:04:52.319" style="s2">you know freedom from pain freedom from</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:55.440" style="s2">anxiety and a very buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.319" end="01:04:56.799" style="s2">kind of notion of um</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.440" end="01:04:58.079" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t even say buddhist notion</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.799" end="01:05:00.240" style="s2">because the actual buddhist notion of</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.079" end="01:05:02.880" style="s2">prajna has very little to do with this</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.240" end="01:05:03.839" style="s2">yeah yeah um but if you do kind of view</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">it as a very</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.839" end="01:05:08.799" style="s2">like you know the cessation of worldly</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:13.039" style="s2">suffering you know to be wise is to</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">not suffer worldly pain um</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.039" end="01:05:16.160" style="s2">that&#39;s one narrative of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">monica&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.160" end="01:05:19.520" style="s2">measure seems to be tracking pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:23.039" style="s2">that right right what</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.520" end="01:05:25.599" style="s2">igor&#39;s measure seems to be tracking is</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.039" end="01:05:26.559" style="s2">wisdom in terms of the pursuit of active</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.599" end="01:05:28.400" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.559" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">right right we&#39;ve kind of described it</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.400" end="01:05:31.520" style="s2">as the negative narrative and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:33.280" style="s2">positive narrative there&#39;s the i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.520" end="01:05:35.039" style="s2">want to be this way narrative which is</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.280" end="01:05:37.039" style="s2">tracked by the 3dws</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.039" end="01:05:39.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s the i do want to be this way</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.039" end="01:05:41.119" style="s2">narrative which is tracked by the swis</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.119" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">oh that&#39;s interesting they track</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:45.920" style="s2">different things for example</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">uh the 3dws the negative wisdom tracks</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.920" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">you know um freedom from stress</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">um i think a little bit more sense of</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:55.599" style="s2">control things like that</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">whereas igor&#39;s measure attracts more</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.599" end="01:05:58.720" style="s2">things like meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">you know like what you get out of this</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.720" end="01:06:02.000" style="s2">kind of thing um</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the epicureans of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.000" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">stoics yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">yes uh yeah i would say that um</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:12.480" style="s2">yeah that uh monica&#39;s view the negative</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">view of wisdom is very much tracking the</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.480" end="01:06:16.160" style="s2">epicurean</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:17.599" style="s2">form of enlightenment whereas the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.160" end="01:06:18.480" style="s2">positive form of wisdom is very much</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.599" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">tracking the stomach form of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.480" end="01:06:21.280" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:22.480" style="s2">now of course i&#39;m going to argue as</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.280" end="01:06:26.720" style="s2">always you need both</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.480" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">yes yeah you know you need</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.720" end="01:06:30.240" style="s2">and you know we&#39;ve had this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.319" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">elsewhere you need</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.240" end="01:06:36.319" style="s2">to both be able to dial back</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.839" end="01:06:37.760" style="s2">your own cognitive biases and reasoning</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.319" end="01:06:40.240" style="s2">and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.760" end="01:06:40.960" style="s2">and you know basically hold yourself at</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.240" end="01:06:42.319" style="s2">bay</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.960" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">which is more the negative view of</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.319" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">wisdom but you also need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:48.720" style="s2">have the shall we say you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:50.480" style="s2">intellectual and existential courage to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.720" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">reach out into the world to try and</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.480" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">change yeah so i&#39;m going to sort of uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:58.640" style="s2">sort of meta assimilation and meta</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:00.400" style="s2">accommodation strategies in a sense yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.640" end="01:07:02.640" style="s2">pretty much um</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.400" end="01:07:04.720" style="s2">so then my you know my interest is okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.640" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">well how does the sense of realness play</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.720" end="01:07:07.280" style="s2">into this</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">like especially realness of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.280" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">attainability of future states of view</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.839" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">um you know realness of certain</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:17.839" style="s2">practices and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">and then the hope is to essentially take</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.839" end="01:07:24.400" style="s2">the branch of my research that looks</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:28.640" style="s2">at aspiration and wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.400" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">and future states of you as well as your</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.640" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">motivations behind why you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:35.039" style="s2">and stick it together with my research</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.799" end="01:07:38.559" style="s2">on wisdom and spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.039" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">and magic to essentially say</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.559" end="01:07:44.400" style="s2">you know if we give you a coherent</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:45.440" style="s2">system for growth for self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.400" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.440" end="01:07:50.720" style="s2">um despite my i think infamous among our</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:53.039" style="s2">colleagues dislike of young</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.720" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">i think this is why people grab onto him</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.039" end="01:07:56.880" style="s2">so tightly</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:07:58.559" style="s2">is he gives you that he gives you that</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.880" end="01:08:01.440" style="s2">in a slightly irresponsible</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:03.280" style="s2">scattered and occluded kind of way which</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.440" end="01:08:06.319" style="s2">is why i don&#39;t like him</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.280" end="01:08:08.319" style="s2">um but he</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.319" end="01:08:09.920" style="s2">gives you a narrative for growth and</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.319" end="01:08:10.640" style="s2">development and unfortunately as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.920" end="01:08:13.839" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.640" end="01:08:16.480" style="s2">elsewhere so do conspiracy theories so</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.839" end="01:08:17.359" style="s2">you need both and so i was going to ask</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.480" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">you maybe that</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.359" end="01:08:20.960" style="s2">that&#39;ll be my final question for you</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">then we can wrap it up because</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.960" end="01:08:24.560" style="s2">i&#39;m just playing a little bit with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:26.799" style="s2">etymology the word wizard which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.560" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">uh supposed to be you know is is an</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.799" end="01:08:30.799" style="s2">archetypal name for</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:31.440" style="s2">some sort of magic user also means wise</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.799" end="01:08:32.880" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.440" end="01:08:34.719" style="s2">and i believe there&#39;s also connections</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.880" end="01:08:37.199" style="s2">between the word wiccan</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.719" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">and wisdom in some fashion etymological</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.199" end="01:08:43.520" style="s2">fashion too they all go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:46.640" style="s2">um to the indo-european word for sight</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.520" end="01:08:50.239" style="s2">right yeah and and so and</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.640" end="01:08:52.080" style="s2">this is why um now this is why i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:55.359" style="s2">think wisdom is an effect of quality</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.080" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">wisdom is ultimately a capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.359" end="01:09:01.759" style="s2">see possibilities yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">see the ultimate at the optimal route so</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.759" end="01:09:05.359" style="s2">cited a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.640" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">insight rather than just visual i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.359" end="01:09:07.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve had this conversation before where</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.520" end="01:09:11.279" style="s2">you know wisdom seems to kind of be an</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:12.159" style="s2">emergent function of insight hindsight</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.279" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2">and foresight</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.159" end="01:09:15.199" style="s2">yes i agree um where there&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:17.359" style="s2">ability to look</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.199" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">deeply into a situation to see how it</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.359" end="01:09:20.719" style="s2">came about and then to predict the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:22.960" style="s2">multiple ways in which it can unfold</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.719" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">yeah um so i&#39;m a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.960" end="01:09:27.920" style="s2">interested you know i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:28.960" style="s2">um you know nick west strait and uh</p>

<p begin="01:09:32.000" end="01:09:37.839" style="s2">the hindsight aspect of wisdom on walk</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.600" end="01:09:38.799" style="s2">right and i think you and igor are</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.839" end="01:09:40.560" style="s2">steadily getting into</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.799" end="01:09:41.920" style="s2">and you know the lab in general still</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.560" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">getting into the insight</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.920" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">portion of wisdom right i&#39;m kind of more</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.960" end="01:09:48.880" style="s2">interested in the foresight</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">oh this is brilliant i hadn&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.880" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">that way before</p>
