<p begin="00:00:10.559" end="00:00:16.720" style="s2">subject today is is karma right</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.960" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">it is karma and forgiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.720" end="00:00:22.560" style="s2">forgiveness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.600" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked a lot about uh no mythology</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.560" end="00:00:25.599" style="s2">and we talked about the eternal return</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.800" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">of the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.599" end="00:00:29.119" style="s2">like everything is circular and comes</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:31.359" style="s2">back to the same place</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.119" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">over and over again now this was the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.359" end="00:00:34.960" style="s2">shared world view by</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">anybody until like three to four</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.960" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:40.960" style="s2">eventology came along and limitology</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">essentially the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.960" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">no it&#39;s not exactly the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:46.719" style="s2">returns</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:47.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a small difference with each</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.719" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">loop</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:54.079" style="s2">and that small difference is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.719" end="00:00:56.480" style="s2">say accumulated information so you store</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.079" end="00:00:59.199" style="s2">information outside of your own brain</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.480" end="00:01:00.800" style="s2">and suddenly you write things down and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.199" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">the next generation can then inherit</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.800" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">more information than you ever had</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.039" end="00:01:07.840" style="s2">and that idea of course is maybe one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">only two or three major ideas</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.840" end="00:01:12.159" style="s2">humans ever come up with was a raster&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:14.960" style="s2">idea 3700 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.159" end="00:01:16.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s the beginning of entology now</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.960" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">what&#39;s also interesting with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.400" end="00:01:19.759" style="s2">is that this enables something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen before</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">existed for it&#39;s called forgiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">we talked a lot about lynch mobs in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">past and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">we all three met in denmark this last</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">week and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:33.920" style="s2">that the current lynch mobs we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">everywhere right now are pagan</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.920" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">all right see if they&#39;re pagan that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:38.000" style="s2">means they&#39;re probably also prevalent in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:39.759" style="s2">the east</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.000" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">because hinduism is still a pagan</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.759" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">religion so</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">uh and certainly there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">paganism going on in china so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:47.360" style="s2">problem here with chinese and indian</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">culture we have a problem with our own</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.360" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">heritage that&#39;s popping up again</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:52.960" style="s2">we&#39;re not even christian any longer we</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.560" end="00:01:54.640" style="s2">go back to paganism so we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.960" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">a good definition of what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.640" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">karma and what you mean by forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">like what is it</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">notion of karma and then we have there</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">is a more sophisticated version of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">i think perhaps the same is true okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:08.720" style="s2">let&#39;s not allow</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">karma to escape the cheap way here let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.720" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">confront karma with all the problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">that inherent in paganism it&#39;s okay so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">karma originally is a pagan concept and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">it is that anything you do</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">it will undoubtedly follow you until the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">day you die and possibly into your next</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s also tied to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">reincarnation because everything returns</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">to the same means you might also be</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">reborn</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">so reincarnation and karma are tied</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">together they&#39;re very pagan concepts</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">and essentially this is what the lynch</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">bob is after the lynch mob when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">attacking you if you&#39;re the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">the lynchburg will tell you that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">is no forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">there&#39;s no way out of your sins or out</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">of your shame you must die</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s total pre-pre-destination</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">is a vulgar notion of karma from my</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">point of view</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t say it&#39;s a vulgar notion i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what karma is if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">elaborate on that later yeah i would</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">allow you to it&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">because i would love to say buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">from this if we can that&#39;s basically the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">theme for this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">so um the problem is that though that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">what soraster then discovers and this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">the original sense of forgiveness the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">seration sense is that oh wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">if there&#39;s difference with each</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">repetition that means it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">great for say a youngster</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">to be able to do something and then make</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">a mistake and learn from the mistake and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">then do it again</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">this is essentially how life works i</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:29.360" style="s2">mean life cannot work without</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">memory without memory inside the cell</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.360" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">there&#39;s no point to life at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">so memories as early as a cell becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">life form</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s always some kind of memory</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">because you will memorize your previous</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">experience this is what it would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">and through this experience you would</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">then you have a memory also learn so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">don&#39;t repeat your mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">so the zoroastrian sense of forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">is very simple and very ethical this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">problems or rasterism think it solves</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">the lynch model problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">because essentially say no no no wait a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">second there is no eternal con</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">damnation there is no sin or shame in</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:02.720" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">because actually you can be forgiven for</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.720" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">your acts</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">not your sins you&#39;ll be forgiven for</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">your act if you have failed</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">and this is actually the sore astral</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">notion of forgiveness is the very simple</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">one you do when you do entrepreneurship</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">oh you failed try again and if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">failed again</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">try again that is forgiveness the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">zoroastrians it&#39;s strictly ethical</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">imperative nothing else but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">both this does not exist in paganism</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">because everything returns the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">means there is no forgiveness there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">way out</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">if you do something it&#39;s eternally valid</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">there&#39;s no way out of karma basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">yeah that is original karma</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">the problem though is to me is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">abrahamic religions of which erasticism</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">is not a part</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">the abrahamic religions we do this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">christianity and islam also have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">different versions of forgiveness i</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">think judaism is the most sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">john kippur is a perfect example of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">but in christianity there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">forgiveness but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">loving and caring it&#39;s called mercy but</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">in those religions you have a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">god and if you have a state of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">perfection that you relate to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">you end up with actually what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:08.800" style="s2">muslims eventually do with a tub or</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s called table and gothi</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.800" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">but the different concepts within islam</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">of forgiveness so basically is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">you made a terrible mistake you must go</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">to god and ask for mercy and never ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">do it again</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">but there&#39;s no learning experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">involved in that sense of forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">this is my problem with the abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">forgivenesses so we have a problem on</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">one end which is the karma vulgar carmia</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">called it</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.639" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">which then generates pagan lynch mobs</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">the other problem is a forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">that comes at a point of mercy from an</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:42.639" style="s2">omnipotent omniscient perfect god</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">but zeratism doesn&#39;t have perfection it</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.639" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a perfect god at all it has</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">forever changed that&#39;s exactly why i</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">think that is the forgiveness i want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">work from</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">how does this relate to buddhism i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">got a few like comments about that like</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">i i think the point of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:06:02.880" style="s2">buddhism basically uh is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">is to kind of transcend karma for one</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.880" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">so so it it&#39;s it&#39;s uh the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">buddhis so it&#39;s a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">grace or something like that when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">transcend karma</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">um the whole point is that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">uh bound to the past um and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">and that there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to to go beyond karma and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">that there&#39;s an open future in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s this creative open</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">so that that would that&#39;s what i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">say is a more</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">but how does forgiveness relate to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">i mean who forgives him</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">who forgives whom well the forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:43.039" style="s2">is is probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">i would say it&#39;s like the the awareness</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.039" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">of the karmic knot is what breaks the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">karmic knot</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">in some sense so that&#39;s why buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">meditate and and you know try to break</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">through this karmic knot</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">to to experience um</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">i find that dissatisfying what does</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">thomas say</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">yeah mr experience of buddhism in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">relation to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">unforgiving and the forgiving well the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">first thing that comes to mind when i</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">hear you that is that um</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">maybe we need to be a bit precise about</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">what what paganism means here</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">i mean paganism has a very precise</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">definition or</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a very precise concept in in uh in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">in the girardian context right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">it&#39;s i mean it&#39;s the old story right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:27.599" style="s2">there&#39;s conflict in the community you</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">find the scapegoat you kill the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.599" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">that way you pacify the community and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">you deify the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">now so so that&#39;s that&#39;s basically the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">essence of paganism right and you said</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">like hinduism and uh and china that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">had a lot of paganism</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">so i&#39;d like to i&#39;d like you to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">that a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">okay i should maybe call it nomidology</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">a normalology without eventology is all</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">we had</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">as long as it could only memorize in our</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">own heads but then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">in normatology if you so let&#39;s say if</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">you have a culture that that puts the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">emphasis on normatology is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">automatically a pagan culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:11.280" style="s2">it is pagan in this sense it&#39;s pagan in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">the sense that karma cannot be forgiven</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.280" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">authority to forgive it that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">why i believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">that&#39;s when you create a lynch mob and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">remove</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">your karma and put it on somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">you can clean yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">why do you need an authority to to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">forgive karma</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">well you&#39;re responsible to somebody if</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">you act</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">you&#39;re in the tribe your actions have</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">repercussions to the tribe&#39;s interests</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">i actually i would interpret this karma</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">more in the sense of like in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">nietzschean sense that you you have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">go beyond being the man of the hurt</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">you know the the tasman that you all</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">that you all also uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">touched upon in previous podcasts the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">unobject that you have to go beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">because that&#39;s irma right the karma is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">basically just while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re thrown into this society</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">that has this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">this generalized opinion and you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">just you can just follow that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">and then you can kind of see that as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">certain karma right</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">yeah well there&#39;s yeah there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">levels of karma like karma just means</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">action right that&#39;s the literal meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">so so there&#39;s all you&#39;re born into this</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">world of karmas</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">right there&#39;s there&#39;s your personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">karmas and your family karmas</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:25.600" style="s2">and your national karmas and well andrew</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">have you used that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.600" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean this is a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">aspect of buddhism that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">somehow kind of you know well i was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">i was looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">you know trump who often has a radical</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">you know shift on things but you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">the vajra is is a thing that it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">karma it just cuts through karma</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">right so that you can experience the now</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">sort of thing and so that you&#39;re free of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">of of you know past</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">burdens and you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">um you&#39;re free to act in a sense so so</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">that&#39;s his inter that&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">interpretation of karma which is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">we could say there&#39;s a hinayana version</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:05.120" style="s2">of karma</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">right or there&#39;s a sutrianic version of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.120" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">karma which is just like do good things</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">do good actions right make you know good</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">actions to have good results and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of like very simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">if not very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:21.600" style="s2">yeah version of karma that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the nominal ideology he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.600" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">about there&#39;s no way out of it right</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a truism in any culture right but</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">here the question is what if you do the</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">crime if you commit a terrible you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">heinous crime and and murder a family</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">according to its standards so that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">and he practiced all this black magic</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">and he was very into paganism right</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">and he met as his teacher and his</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">teacher said build these</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">you know build these towers continually</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">build these towers and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">and then and then smash them down again</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">and and he became free of of the karma</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">of his</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">his negative acts and he was forgiven</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">you know not forgiven by</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">by his teacher but but existentially he</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">was free</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">this gets weird but okay i want to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">back to the social aspect of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">because i think we need to return to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">lynch small because that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">started this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">like several episodes ago so my promise</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">is that if you move</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">we realize we have a problem here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">called karma it&#39;s universally a problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">your acts will haunt you</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">whether you like it or not and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:02.560" style="s2">culturally they do</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">in a non-biological society which was</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">any society to this planet for say the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.639" end="00:12:08.880" style="s2">last hundred thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">until very recently that was a given you</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">know bad acts had repercussions the only</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">way to not a bad ex was to basically say</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">bad acts are completely unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:18.079" style="s2">there was a zero tolerance toward bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">acts that&#39;s essentially what</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.079" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">you know deep karma would be i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">object again i&#39;m sorry like</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">yeah you like uh in the odyssey all kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">of the gods do all kinds of bad acts and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">they get away with it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">you&#39;re way later in history your way the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">odyssey you&#39;re way</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">you&#39;re way beyond this is no matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">logical and the tolerance already</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">as soon as you have written literature</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">you can&#39;t see there&#39;s no ethics in those</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">early stories right</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not early stories they&#39;re recent</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">stories we&#39;re talking about hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">thousands of years here okay anyway go</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">on go on</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">okay i found a little bit more whereas</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:51.839" style="s2">social biological reshape was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">dissociate the associate lasted for 60</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.839" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">to 70 thousand years the artist is way</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">after that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">you can&#39;t use written literature here to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">make another gods the whole thing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.320" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">thomas is talking about the the pagan</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">lynch mobs and and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">that&#39;s later that&#39;s later again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">after nominology that&#39;s after</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">okay exclusive numerology followed by a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">number of the plus avatars</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">absolutely i mean that&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">beginning that&#39;s how we became humans</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">no wait a second this is a continual</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">argument we always have actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">zoroaster is a thousand years before the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">odyssey</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">so raster knows already then that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">eventology is a fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">so no the greeks were immersed well the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">were talking about a world where people</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">believe in gods and wrath you know god&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">is all about forefathers it&#39;s ur mothers</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">and ur fathers it&#39;s not about gods even</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">the chinese never even went for the gods</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:45.360" style="s2">so wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">my pointer is this it&#39;s about the lynch</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.360" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s about the mob it&#39;s about society</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">you got to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">rid of this excess there&#39;s an excess</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">hair or bad acts</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.279" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">some of you got to solve that and of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">course the way to do that in a gerardian</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">way is basically to put the blame on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">scapegoat take anybody who won&#39;t protest</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">make that person the scapegoat and drag</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">them through the streets and kill them</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">and you get the release</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">so there&#39;s not only envy which gerard is</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">correct about</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:11.839" style="s2">there&#39;s also a release in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">karmas being put on this creature</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.839" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">so in christianity christ on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">does both</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">both throw all the sins on to him but at</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">the same time obviously</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">he&#39;s an example of what happens if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">scapegoat somebody so we should avoid</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">you can argue both and it&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">with christianity i don&#39;t have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">christ takes on the escape i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">christianity christianity&#39;s strongest</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">is his forgiveness but i want to argue</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">here i started with michael butler last</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">week in denmark</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">i want to argue here the christian sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">of forgiveness and surah sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">forgiveness and probably jewish in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">are different and they&#39;re all rich these</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">traditions are rich because they try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:49.199" style="s2">deal with how to avoid the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">what soresters basically do is they say</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.199" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">bad activity was intentional major</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">problem but at least a non-intentional</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.560" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">bad act</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">is not drug drug is all about intentions</p>

<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:06.399" style="s2">moralism so basically that&#39;s why so</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">rasters are great entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.399" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the wealthiest people ever</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">great degrees and they go out and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">conquer the world now how do you become</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:22.399" style="s2">such a successful culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have a principle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">actually very clever that principle is</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">that oh you made a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">listen try again that is original</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:33.440" style="s2">forgiveness to me if you go back about 4</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">000 years because of eventology</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">i would argue that it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">unless the event happens and the event</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">is neutral</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">the event can be ecstatic or it can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just difference and you can prepare</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">for that so that means</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">when you when you notice that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">difference with each repetition</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">you start to plan for the next</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">repetition that&#39;s what civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">you start a plan for okay it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go for another loop now of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">the eternal recurrence of the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">let&#39;s make the deviations something more</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:05.759" style="s2">productive this time rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">destructive this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.759" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">asha versus druid</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">i let the repetition happen the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">difference that come out can be anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">usually it&#39;s traumatic usually terrible</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">because nature will go towards the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">terrible the traumatic unless you try to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">direct it</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:27.360" style="s2">towards the event big static okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">go towards ecstatically you create an</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.360" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">authentic event this is alan badu by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">way this is all phallic philosophy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t believe being an event returns</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">to this idea you can&#39;t direct the future</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">by planning for it towards the more</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.839" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">constructive</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">that&#39;s asha now in that process you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">discover and by the way if we do go</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">towards a traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">we intended to go towards the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">constructed</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">grade okay can we learn from that yes we</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">because we&#39;re a life form that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">memory we can actually store that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">information we can write it in the books</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">that&#39;s you start writing bibles you</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">write the book of job write cain and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">abel you write all these stories</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">this is what happens if you do wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">by reading the story</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">you can avoid making that mistake so</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some link to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:16.319" style="s2">literacy and forgiveness yes okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s interesting rasterism</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">and judaism are children of that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">then christianity takes on a more</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">sentimental version of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">which i think nietzsche properly</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">criticizes</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:29.919" style="s2">because he finds it meek and weak</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">because the forgiveness in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.919" end="00:17:34.799" style="s2">osama becomes too generous</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">or too sentimental and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.799" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">problem nietzsche hasn&#39;t really found</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">out is that the more</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">perfect you make god who&#39;s the authority</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">gives the forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">the more perfect god is the more you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">venture resort into the trap or islam</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">ended up and islam there is no</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">forgiveness there&#39;s only repentance</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">well i have something to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">in terms of the the jewish tradition</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">because in certain aspects of the jewish</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">tradition god has a dark side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">called the siddhatra or something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">god is not only good and pure</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">and absolute it&#39;s there&#39;s also a dark</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">side to god</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">and so he a human being&#39;s job is</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">actually to help god</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">that&#39;s just part of the the this part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">the jewish um um</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">um you know so so we&#39;re more implied</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">we have more of a purpose here rather</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">than let&#39;s say up you know a</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">protestant idea where where you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">you&#39;re just sort of you know you just</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">uh uh there&#39;s just this predestination</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">you&#39;re just sort of bound to karma</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:34.960" style="s2">love it so so in judaism in judaism you</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">do these acts uh they&#39;re called misfus</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">in order to help god because god&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">really bored if</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">human beings are not there to to help in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">this creative act so so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">so it stands for giving not a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:48.559" style="s2">wait a second is that forgiveness in</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">judaism a social event or is it a divine</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.559" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">event</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter sure i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">know i know much about how they</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">how they what they do for forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">okay what&#39;s important here though is</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">that you just describe the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">god which is imperfection</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s no perfection at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">invented by the greeks way later so</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">the aura and master are split phallus</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">that in itself says it&#39;s not infinite</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a finite entity and definite entity</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">is not perfect because nothing is ever</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">perfect because the world is ever</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">changing</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">fresh or correct so that&#39;s the point so</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">zoroastrian i think is gets away with</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:25.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s a question we brought up before</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">is that why did the sore astron empires</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">not have tons of lynch mobs they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">apparently incredibly rare in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">persian empire</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">incredibly rare and sore probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">because they had a way of dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:39.440" style="s2">karma i would say like a correct way</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">of dealing with karma that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.440" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">prevent the lynch mods right no</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">no well wait partly yes but</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to have a culture a proper</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">cultural forgiveness but the forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">must not be sentimental and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">devoid of reality it must be related to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">something real</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">yeah now the question i returned to then</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">is that how is buddhism throughout</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">history tried to solve this because i</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">think it has to do with the buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:05.280" style="s2">attitude towards the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">because as long as the lynch as long as</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.280" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got karma out there</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">and karma is a fiendishly hard thing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">get rid of and you can only do it on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">personal level but not on the social</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">i see the lynch mobs are still there in</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">the streets i don&#39;t see how you actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:20.080" style="s2">get out of the lynch mob culture unless</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.280" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">disappears in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">where you&#39;re allowed to change your ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">and you can be forgiven for your past</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">what do you think thomas do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">do to refund that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">the classic way to avoid uh to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">mobs to avoid scapegoating is is</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">prohibition</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">religious prohibition so that you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">too much</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">envy and jealousy because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">leads to mobs</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s why that&#39;s why all religions</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:05.280" style="s2">have very very</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">severe prohibitions with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.280" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">sexual sexuality because sexuality is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">is an extreme source of envy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">jealousy so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">what for example christians get very</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">wrong right so they think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">something inherently problematic with</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anything probably inherently</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">problematic with sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just that it very easily leads to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">jealousy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">envy and that&#39;s why you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">careful with it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">well i i lived in a buddhist monastery</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">there are confession rituals you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">you you confess your</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">your you confess your karma i guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">to other people it could be your</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">thoughts could be similar to i guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">christianity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of confession process but</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">the confession is followed by the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">blessing</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">uh in christianity you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">from your sins off you go</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">do you do that with the book you do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">do you do that within buddhism did you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">practice that in buddhism or is it just</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">a you know you let your heart out you</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">pour your heart out and you tell people</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">what you&#39;ve been up to but that&#39;s you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">in any 12-step program</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">yeah 12-step programs do not offer you</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:12.799" style="s2">forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.840" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">um well yeah you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.799" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">there&#39;s the same i don&#39;t know i guess</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">the difference between catholic</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">confessional is you go and meet somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:22.720" style="s2">and he</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">he he he forgives you or something</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.720" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">whereas that forgiveness is the point</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">not the confession</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:30.039" style="s2">no i&#39;m back to what thomas just said</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">though i agree</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.039" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">completely so this is where christianity</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">runs into problems to me christianity</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">its problems increasingly come out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">mimicking</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">previous what i call the major religions</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">here i would consider christianity in</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">islam as minor religions and i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">islam has enormous problems because</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">islam is like</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">is it it&#39;s like the pop culture parody</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">of of what went before it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">relation between zorasis and islam is</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">clearly that way</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">the same thing i think with judaism and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">christianity there&#39;s a richness</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">into these religions the older they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">and the older they are they come</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">less out of these sort of platonist</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">ideas of perfection and infinity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">immortality</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">because if you get immortality out the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">door if you get infinity out the door to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">get perfection out the door in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:14.880" style="s2">it&#39;s probably really good religion to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">work from</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">you see what i mean it also doesn&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">have a problem with sexuality it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">realizes</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">the problem is envy because i don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">the jews and i don&#39;t see the saurons or</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">the buddhists having a major problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:30.000" style="s2">with sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">i think no they don&#39;t christians wrongly</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.000" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">focus on sexuality itself instead of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">the sexuality is is one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">people fight over it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">therefore therefore their place ended</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">with sexuality itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">as a source of sin and christianity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">yeah well yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">we all agree with that this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">um whereas yeah you might go and live in</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">a monastery and you might</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">avoid sexuality but you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">not you don&#39;t consider it to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">evil or what did thomas say</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">well in the sense that christianity</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">tries to do the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">the right thing but they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">it&#39;s that they confuse the means with</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">ends right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:15.600" style="s2">regulating christianity is just</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:16.640" style="s2">regulating sexuality is a means to an</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">end and that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">to limit the the the proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">envy and jealousy</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">so in that sense in that sense we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">disagree we have the institution of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">marriage</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">and all that inherently problematic</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">what are you okay can you finish that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.679" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">thomas i&#39;m sorry i interpreted yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">that&#39;s in this sense i mean as much as i</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">like paglia but there we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">disagree with pacquiao</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">because she kind of says that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">sexuality is inherently catonic</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s inherently problematic it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have to be like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">uh-huh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">okay that&#39;s where you go utopian thomas</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">this gets interesting this is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">new direction for tonight&#39;s conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">but i love it well paglia says art is</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">sort of like you know wait wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">question is good</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">and under andre i love your talk in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">case i&#39;d love thomas to elaborate more</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">on the difference between hammurich and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:12.580" style="s2">paglia when it comes to sexuality</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.120" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">i think i got it but yeah it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">that i i read also there was a book</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">about</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">but basically the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">the idea is that the sexuality is in</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">inherently problematic as</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">as a problematic thing but you can you</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">can but</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">if you look at it from from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">view of why is it problematic well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">not inherently problematic but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s one of those things that lead</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">to jealousy and envy and that&#39;s the real</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">problem and jealousy and envy will</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">come from all kinds of areas so you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">that you can get that from</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">from material greed you can have that</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">from prestige and and and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">so in that sense there is so so</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:05.679" style="s2">christianity has a focus</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">a big focus on on sexuality that is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.679" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">bit um</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">that makes it a bit unworkable for many</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">people i think that the views of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">of christianity with respect to to to</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">sexuality is something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">has turned many people away i remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:21.039" style="s2">paglia also saying that the power of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">catholic culture</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.039" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">right is the fact that they repress</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">sexuality and then so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.120" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">it it i think this is called this art</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">power and and i think that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">wrong that&#39;s that was fabulous</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">that religions religions use sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.360" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">to gain power</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">i mean i never really understood that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">how would that how would that happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">that&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">trying to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">people to become jealous and envious of</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.159" style="s2">and if they do that you get conflict</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">throughout the whole community and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.159" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">start killing each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">or they start killing scapegoats that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">why you have all these religious</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">prohibitions</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">that&#39;s also why you try to distribute</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">wealth within communities in all</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">the same thing and this is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">problematic in the persian empire</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:09.600" style="s2">they got agnostics who said we should</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">totally even out the wealth</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">which is of course the master kites the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">origin of islam and of socialism in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">west starts with mastoc and his idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">that we should basically have a state</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">that takes all the property so we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">then distribute it</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.600" style="s2">according to needs right the vulgar</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">version of marxism is the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.600" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">when marx for example said that to each</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">according to his needs</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">he meant to each according to his needs</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">considering who&#39;s going to work tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">morning</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">meaning that the workers should have</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">more than anybody else because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">going to go to work the next month he</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">according to body size or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">that at all that&#39;s vulgar and marxism</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">one of the problems with the tax marxism</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">they they don&#39;t understand this</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">but the master creates that problem so</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">that was inherent problems or asterism</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">because within an</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:55.919" style="s2">empire it was really hard to distribute</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">wealth to the extent you avoided</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.919" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">envy so avoiding mv central to really i</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:02.320" style="s2">agree on that but</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">i disagree and actually agree with pogba</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.320" end="00:28:07.039" style="s2">here because sexuality is problematic</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:08.960" style="s2">but problematic here is in a delusion</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">sense productively problematic</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.960" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s ambivalent and anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">that that dances on ambivalence your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">subjectivity is another example of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">you can never really agree on who you</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">are who you are you can never really</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">understand yourself that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">according to hegel that is yourself the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">selfie status which is concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">being yourself and cannot make up its</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">mind what it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">that is being yourself to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">according to hebrew so at the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">goes to sexuality subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">sexuality are very similar here</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">the same thing goes for the worldview we</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">can&#39;t really agree on how the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">operates because we can&#39;t agree or it</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">operates we&#39;ll stare at the stars every</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">night</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">and there are you know riddles out on</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">how the world operates and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">of course where it&#39;s origin of science</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">and curiosities it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">we can never really nail how the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">and and that is ambivalence and i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">sexuality should more be compared to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">subjectivity in science</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">then it should be compared as a moral</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">problem it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the three artistic problem or</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">something the thrill of it is that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">never reaches a balance and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">we want to avoid here</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:12.720" style="s2">the tallest fantasies of the yin and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">young reach in some kind of balance is</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">what i&#39;m against i</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">i think there&#39;s always three not two and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">the third</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">force is always the one that starts</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">everything gets everything moving again</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">whenever you&#39;re close to anything that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">looks like a balance</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">that&#39;s why for example contemporary law</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">concerning sexuality is completely</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">deranged</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">there is no such thing as a contractual</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">consent before you [ __ ] somebody because</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">the [ __ ] is gonna be terrible</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">if you do that and that is problematic</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">right it&#39;s um but it&#39;s a good problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">like the law said the problems are</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2">but it seems that we are i think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">when i hear you talking also about uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">about uh zoryastranism then then it</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">seems that it&#39;s it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">it&#39;s about skills versus not having</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">it&#39;s about it it&#39;s about constructive</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">action or or action that actually works</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">that accomplishes something in the in</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:07.919" style="s2">the world versus</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">versus clumsiness or ignorance or just</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.919" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">lack of skills</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:12.960" style="s2">rather than good versus evil oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">they&#39;re still good versus evil and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.960" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">zoroastrianism</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">remember this is the most misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">concept or religion</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">ever like anything you&#39;ve heard about</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">soras and forget it okay read the</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">so why not operate in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">actually is aligned with how things work</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">that means just basically optimize your</p>

<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">optimize your behavior that is the</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">opposite of that drugs is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">oh you couldn&#39;t care less and because</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t care less</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">you go envious of others who&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">made an effort and that starts a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">destructive spiral</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">that becomes poison within a society</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">that is the understanding of drugs and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">prefer to use the original terms here</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">so forgiveness here is essentially i</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">will not forgive you if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">seriously mean you&#39;re gonna try again</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">and learn from your previous experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">that sounds like a bit aristotle who</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">said it</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">you know that apparently the romans</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">mistranslated aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">aristotle he didn&#39;t mean good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">he meant excellence or something or</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">yeah yeah what do you think where do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">think you got that from</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">i think i i probably got it from</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:38.720" style="s2">heidegger but no where do you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:42.399" style="s2">aristotle got that idea from</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">oh right does his roster yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.399" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">so if you study it right miracles</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:48.799" style="s2">are both court philosophers in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:50.000" style="s2">personal empire i mean the connection</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.799" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">with persian greece is just</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">embarrassingly underrated right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">there&#39;s not this platonic good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a it&#39;s more of a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:31:59.919" style="s2">um you know idea yeah and actually you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">and i under have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.919" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">john for varkid that he reminded me</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">that i cannot put new platinus and under</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">the same umbrella as i do with platonism</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">because with neoplatonism coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">alexandria in egypt the influence from</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">the persons had returned and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">modest</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.399" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">understanding of the world is actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">acceptable very important gets really</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:19.279" style="s2">interesting you start studying him</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">and that again is that the influence</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.279" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">goes back and forth in the hellenistic</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">so so that happens all the time okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">february has a problem with that i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s fantastic i think the hellenistic</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">world was fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s the cross cross breeding</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">of these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">that that actually were still working</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.000" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">with today</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">makes sense so how about the christian</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">forgiveness here nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">i want to go back to forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">forgiveness because i don&#39;t think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">gotten to the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">no let&#39;s go to the christian version</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">here because it it</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">no matter i think it&#39;s the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">christianity gave to the world and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">think it has</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">paid off handsomely in the west for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">last two thousand years been incredible</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t have limited companies in in</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">in the corporate world unless i said</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:07.039" style="s2">christianity had forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">implemented into it and you went for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">confession you confessed</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">you took it all out and actually i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">forgiveness in christianity because you</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:16.640" style="s2">also forgive your brother</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">your sister in the congregation is a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.640" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">of getting rid of a load it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">either you have to carry this heavy</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">weight around that</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">actually somebody did something nasty to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">you or you you you were involved in</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">somebody who did something nasty they</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have done or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">you want to have it undone and the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">to have it undone is to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">forgive</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">yeah but it avoids the escalation</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">reciprocal escalation</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">because if somebody did you wrong okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">you react by</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">giving that person the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">then that person</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">again reacts and then so you have that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">the typical escalation so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">that that leads to mobs and that needs</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">scapegoating so</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">christianity very much tries to to</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">defuse that mechanism through</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">yeah and it took until the the end of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">century or something before it stopped</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:08.720" style="s2">in the balkans right and there was again</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">a pagan heritage</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.720" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just like somebody killed in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">village would go into the next village</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">and kill one of theirs then they come</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">back here and kill us and it goes on</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly these escalations that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">try to avoid and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">i think it comes out of a more imperial</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">understanding of humanity so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">we can&#39;t have violence here in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">province where people just go around and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">kill each other all the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">so we take all the young men out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">there put them in an army somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">invade</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">uh and then we teach them a religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">where you just don&#39;t do that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">a way out</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you put a confession</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">booth in the church rebuilt here</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:45.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just a ritual place where</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:47.159" style="s2">you repeat the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.040" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">over and over again with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.159" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">nomadological approach to reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">repetition of the same over and over</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">again the same rituals</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">with the same ending and this is where i</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">think the pagan lynch mobs come in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">and the cleansing of the community by</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:04.079" style="s2">putting you know all the karma on to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">one body and then get rid of that body</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.079" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">and somehow you&#39;re cleansed for the next</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">year or so</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.720" end="00:35:10.240" style="s2">yeah and then of course you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">repeat it all over again the next year</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.240" end="00:35:13.680" style="s2">that was the problem with that model</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:14.839" style="s2">when we had growing populations and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.680" end="00:35:17.440" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.839" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">settled and we started storing</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.440" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">this just got more and more destructive</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">and worse and worse and there was</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">there had to be a way out of it and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">so raster presented one version of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">obviously there are other ways of trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">to deal with that i think all the major</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">religions do</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">deal with that they deal with how are we</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">going to distribute wealth</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">and create less source of envy</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">and just avoid envy because it causes so</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">much destruction</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">cain and abel is the oldest book in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:46.960" style="s2">old testament for a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">this is what happens this is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">happened you go and kill your brother</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">because you end them just on envy how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">you avoid enemy well</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s both your own personal journeys to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">avoid envy</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.480" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">but also we need to create a community</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">where this just won&#39;t happen there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">also the notion of loving the stranger</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">which you&#39;ve brought up a few times</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:05.920" style="s2">like the samaritan who lifts the the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">guy from the the ditch or whatever who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">not a part of his tribe</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">he kind of um he breaks that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">pattern as</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:16.079" style="s2">well like uh yeah but it&#39;s a rastiness</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">in the way you solve it that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.079" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">tolerate other religions</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">you basically the different fields the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">different levels</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">so you have one level eva was saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">that that this was very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">actually like</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">this was a problematic notion of of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">when it when it became uh sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">institutionalized</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">institutionalized we can return to that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">but let me just go back to our</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">assistance this is older right</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">what they do is that you have one level</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">which you call abstract religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">abstract religion is the religion of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">priests and the military and all those</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">guys in the specific</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s often abstract in the sense you</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">can worship a completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">uh ignorant god it doesn&#39;t care about us</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">you know if that&#39;s the truth that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">truth you just go and search</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">for the truth mysterian cults always did</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">that right the occult always did that</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">they went beyond the bard absolute to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">that and they made that pursuit and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:07.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t meant for the public</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">that&#39;s why those religions were never</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.680" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">written down but that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:12.560" style="s2">created two different fields but the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">other one was folk religion which we</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.560" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">call iconology so you go to the lesser</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">gods and you worship your eldest presti</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">or ganesha or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">you can relate to them because you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:23.440" style="s2">talk to them like an older brother or</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">or or or a father figure or a mother</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:26.000" style="s2">figure or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">in christianity that&#39;s praying to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.000" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">virgin mary so she can talk to god</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">right so or the saints</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">those are the lesser gods and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.280" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">why you have two different levels of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">religion and therefore you can have</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">and if you can have tolerance hey you</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">can love the stranger he doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">share your faith</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">your faith is not on your forehead</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">you&#39;re just running to each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">city</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">you live in your blocks your quarters</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">with your religion</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">he lives in his block over there with</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">his religion and all the major trade</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">cities along the trade routes were</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">constructed like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">from xi&#39;an in china all the way to cairo</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">that all these</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">jewish quarters and persian quarters and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">whatever afghan quarters in turkish</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">quarters</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">where minorities lived and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">practiced a different religion it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">completely accepted</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">it was he was even endorsed right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">i think loving a stranger actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">starts with creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:22.000" style="s2">a container with within which you can do</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">that christianity and this makes it a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.000" end="00:38:24.800" style="s2">moral imperative</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">i think if you&#39;re pagan you can&#39;t love</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">the stranger right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">completely bound to your tribe right you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">of course yes so you&#39;re not gonna help</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">the guy out of the ditch who&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">you you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">you know you can only surround yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">well if you don&#39;t understand yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no space from your</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">levels from</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">is where can you find food to eat you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">run into another tribe you kill them</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">i mean it was it was constant warfare</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">because anybody from a different tribe</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">than yours you would kill them</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">yes that&#39;s how he lived as long as we</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">were nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">population was never more than 3 million</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">on the entire planet</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">but the roman empire was was very we had</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">a lot of different cultures a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">different religions and it was utterly</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">pagan so</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">i think that you you can have pagan</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.000" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">making societies of pagan religions that</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">that can deal with a stranger</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">but it just comes at the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">regularly killing scapegoats</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">yeah but the roman empire the roman</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">empire inherited a structure from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">persians</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">the persians were about 600 years before</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">the roman empire so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.839" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">they mimicked each other yeah but pagan</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">religion works fine right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not as if it doesn&#39;t work i mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">this thing works very well is this very</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">brutal i mean because</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:38.400" style="s2">you know because you regularly are going</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">to kill people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.400" end="00:39:42.880" style="s2">that&#39;s built into the religion so</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">instead of letting the victimh</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.880" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">mechanism run rampant you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">organize it that&#39;s what what the nazis</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:49.680" style="s2">tried to do right</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">the nazis tried to bring back organized</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.680" end="00:39:53.520" style="s2">paganism</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">yeah right yeah and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">basically you know it could have worked</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">the roman empire was also organized</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">paganism they just killed a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">you know like if you want to pacify the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">the the community if you have problems</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">in the community</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">then you just kill people and and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:10.880" style="s2">made that work for a long time so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">not impossible to make it work it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.880" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">at some point you know uh christianity</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">kind of came up with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">there&#39;s something better and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">zoroastrianism also did that that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.599" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">can organize</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">a society that doesn&#39;t rely on these</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">regular blob bots</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">but of course now we are in a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">interesting situation where</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">um where christianity is kind of to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">certain extent we&#39;re on its course right</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">so now</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:37.200" style="s2">we&#39;re in these apocalyptic times where</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">we got rid of paganism</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.200" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">paganism doesn&#39;t work anymore well there</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">are some mobs out there but nobody</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">really buys into it right i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">like niches</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">here and there this is not causing a an</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">entire society to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">to find to find this doesn&#39;t calm down</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">an entire society anymore right</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.319" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">so we don&#39;t know that yet but yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">well it&#39;s become a kind of form of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">on some level i think coming we can have</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:04.560" style="s2">the an object that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">hijacked by a dictator that&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">always a possibility right but even that</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">will not last long that will end with</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">with a with a war that ends us all or it</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">will disappear again just like the nazis</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">disappeared it&#39;s just not not</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just not workable it&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">anymore that and the two that</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">that train left 2000 years ago you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">cannot i don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">actually have</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">oh you had stalin for 30 years you had</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">mao in china for 30 years and you had</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">palpatine china</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">in cambodia for a couple of years there</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">aren&#39;t successful societies that people</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">look up to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">with great economic growth and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">like that i mean they&#39;re kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">bit like well</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">these are failed attempts to create</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">order right</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">yeah i i i would say though that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">only reason why the woke</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">culture today isn&#39;t more successful</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">because the woke people haven&#39;t realized</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:54.560" style="s2">they&#39;re fighting a symbolic war</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">rather than a physical actual war but</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.560" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">when they realized that they could take</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">weapons into their hands and quickly</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:01.040" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">that&#39;s why i think it&#39;s dangerous today</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">i think that i think people are getting</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">killed now in america and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:08.319" style="s2">that that is because some of these guys</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">especially the antifa guys and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.319" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">some of the black lives matter guys</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">and the patriot prayer guys on the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">hand probably have realized that no no</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">wait a second we gain by picking up real</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:18.960" style="s2">weapons and killing each other for real</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">which is probably what we wanted all</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.960" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">what the whole people haven&#39;t realized</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">is that when they go into symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">warfare they attack people like me for</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">example in scandinavia</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.520" end="00:42:29.440" style="s2">i just returned the favor and my youtube</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">audiences go up</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.440" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">but once you realize that this was</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">actually your social biological program</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say they should be symbolic it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">should be physical and actual</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">then they will go after people hey where</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">were we yeah where were we</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">thomas is looking up something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">actually feel a bit uh i was rambling</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">when uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">when you asked me about this paglia</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">stuff and uh so i looked it up now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">this book called the renaissance mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">theory by wolfgang pallava</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">which is a very nice summary of of uh of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">girardi</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">actually also talks about a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">thinkers and he writes</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">so despite the proximity of paglian</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.200" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">girard with respect to the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">of sexuality and violence</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">however the difference between these two</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">thinkers is important for an</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">understanding of the mimetic theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:20.319" style="s2">paglia completely avoids the memetic</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">cause of violence in the sexual realm</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.319" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">arguing instead of the connection of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">two phenomena is a natural constant</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">sexuality and violence she says are</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">intrinsically connected and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">necessarily problematic</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">so and i agree with gerard here</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">yeah not paglia so paglia i mean of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">course these two do think</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">sexuality is less inherently problematic</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">than people</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">than people claim and this is this is an</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:48.319" style="s2">eternal beef that i have with</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">with christians who are obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.319" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">make turning</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">sexuality into an inherent problem and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">not seeing that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">sexuality as as as sexuality that is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">problem but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the envy and the jealousy that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">associated with</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.200" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">sexuality that is not skillful i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">that would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">the precise formulation okay great it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.280" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">kind of rare</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.400" end="00:44:11.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t it to to find sexuality that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">uh no i mean that&#39;s the thing is that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:16.720" style="s2">mean people</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">need to be skilled in sexuality you need</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:21.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">problematic to do that in our society</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.760" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">because we&#39;re getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">puritan</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">that means that people get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:28.800" style="s2">unskilled in sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.040" style="s2">and they will get in more and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.800" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">trouble so it&#39;s kind of like a vicious</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.040" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a vicious circle right so so more</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:38.640" style="s2">puritanism</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">less education and less less less skill</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">and more problems so and that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">more puritanism so</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of in a very interesting uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">uh spiral</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">i agree on this one that means we</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t gone pagan about</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">sexuality at all we&#39;ve gone sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">even more christian than christianity</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">about it because victorian</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">almost no no no the thing is that the 20</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">year olds today no no the 20 year old so</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">they&#39;re having tons of sex</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.880" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s very [ __ ] up right</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">so what they&#39;re doing for example is</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">that uh they have new</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">numerality where it&#39;s like if you&#39;re 25</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">and have sex with somebody 17</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like the worst thing ever but you</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">can have really hardcore cytomasochistic</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">sex to be 80 years old if your partner</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">19 or something like that it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:25.520" style="s2">whole new</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:26.960" style="s2">moralism that makes no sense at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.520" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">except that there must be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.960" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">morality around it</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">and that to me is a christian heritage</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">because these kids have no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">sexuality is</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">they it can be fostered to it at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">it&#39;s basically through</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">pornography and that&#39;s it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">pornography is not a guide towards</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">pornography is just like walking into</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:45.839" style="s2">this land and think it&#39;s a university it</p>

<p begin="00:46:15.839" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s all i wanted to say i mean what</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">in terms of healthy sexuality</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">what i mean i always think about as uh</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">an amazing community with a lot not of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">know-how and i agree i agree</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:43.280" style="s2">we went to the european men&#39;s gathering</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">last week and we all know the first rule</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.280" end="00:46:46.480" style="s2">in these gatherings is that fix your</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">damn sex life otherwise your brothers</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.480" end="00:46:49.040" style="s2">can&#39;t trust you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not the normal rule and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.040" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">done and it&#39;s done by almost all of them</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">it must not be problematic so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">looking at a trade-off here between east</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">and west</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:46:59.839" style="s2">if we&#39;re looking at the overall</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">conversation tonight</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.839" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">we still haven&#39;t gotten to how east</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">tries to solve the problem between karma</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">and forgiveness which the west</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.599" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">or the middle east and the west did</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.440" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">better right uh the problem though with</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">the with the west is that it arrived</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">with the problem with sexuality here</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">with pogba versus gerard</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">clearly shows and sherrod is right about</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">that the problem wasn&#39;t sexuality itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:23.359" style="s2">sexuality is ambivalent correct it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">is subjectivity so is science so</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.359" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">so that that doesn&#39;t have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">problem at all the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">sexuality it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">i put sexuality and violence into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">category of pathos and i think pathetic</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">narrative is completely underrated in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">our society today</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:38.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a sexuality violence pops up in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">all the wrong places and that&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">gay it&#39;s getting increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">problematic that&#39;s where pogba is on to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">something and i completely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">obviously with the pathos needing to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:49.040" style="s2">there next to the logos and the mythos</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">but in the east we need to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.040" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">the east since and this is my experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:55.760" style="s2">both zoroastrianism buddhism and daoism</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">is that none of them have a major</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:47:59.680" style="s2">problem with sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.359" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">yeah those three religions because</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:04.319" style="s2">they&#39;ve tantric traditions</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">has solved their problems when i became</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.319" end="00:48:07.839" style="s2">a zoroaster and you know converted</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">early 1990s and i started hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.839" end="00:48:10.960" style="s2">with zoroastrians from america and india</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">and europe alike</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">you know it was just like yeah you get</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">married because you actually unified two</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">different families so there&#39;s like two</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">clans get together and the way to tie</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">them together is a married</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s like a company running</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">together which is actually why they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">a very low divorce rate</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">you know you should actually men and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">women should meet and say let&#39;s run a</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">corporation together and call it a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good idea of a family so</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">they do that right and they have larger</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">more extended families that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">valid</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">and they hold so they have a very low</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:39.599" style="s2">divorce rate brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">now the trick is then what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.599" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">with your sexuality and they just looked</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.960" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">at me just like well</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">who you sleep with is a totally</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">different story wherever you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">execute your sexuality and you use that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:50.559" style="s2">energy obviously</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">very small part of it is going to be for</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.559" end="00:48:54.079" style="s2">reproductive purposes which means your</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">husband or your wife is not that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">now there might be part seasons or</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">esther&#39;s out there disagreeing in public</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">about this but they would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">private agree because this is how they</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">live also i don&#39;t find a major problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">in sexuality in israel i think israelis</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">or jews in general are much more relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">about sexuality than christians and</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">muslims are yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">so so that&#39;s not a major problem yet the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">problem is when we approach</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">islam and christianity the pop religions</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">of the west</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">is that suddenly sexuality itself is</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:25.280" style="s2">seen as the problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">i wonder if it&#39;s because there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">strong matriarchal culture like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">not women involved</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">somehow in uh in in dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">sexuality like i mean this was something</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">i got from paglia too</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">since we&#39;re speaking of her she</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">mentioned you know in the east you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">you have tantric women teachers yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not like feminism has helped us</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">well no it&#39;s not feminism it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s tradition right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:53.440" style="s2">there is a tradition of a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:54.000" style="s2">of female right than than mother mary</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.000" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">and ver you know than this soft kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">kind of female there&#39;s well i would</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">agree because then if islam is the worst</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">case here then certainly if you lock up</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">women behind the jobs and things and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">lock them up in a house and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">you have to [ __ ] each other as men</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:11.200" style="s2">before you&#39;re allowed to [ __ ] women and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">when you do you might rape them</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.200" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">gets worse right so but you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">pagan wasn&#39;t nice either like so so uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s nasty uh but again if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">create larger gatherings the social</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">becomes larger forms than clan or tribe</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">and clan tribe you can contain sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:32.079" style="s2">per se</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">then if you have larger communities you</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.079" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">need prohibitions and these prohibitions</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:37.440" style="s2">are ultimately not about</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.760" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">controlling sexuality because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.440" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">just creating pressure cookers</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:42.880" style="s2">so anybody would know is rather about</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:44.160" style="s2">you know letting it out somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.880" end="00:50:46.319" style="s2">and then use it for constructive</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">purposes and the way you do that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.319" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">you avoid making it a topic event</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">but return to the education the weakness</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.800" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">of the east in all of this is that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">that insult sexuality better than the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:03.040" style="s2">west did</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">but you still got the problem with karma</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.040" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">and this is an acute problem in india</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">where i work a lot these days because in</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">india</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">they are now mimicking the west on a</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:13.520" style="s2">massive scale and they have all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.599" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">programmers and the coders of the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:17.359" style="s2">and they have now a huge huge industry</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">employing tens of millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.359" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">who basically do all the program and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:21.280" style="s2">coding you know computers for the rest</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.280" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">now that&#39;s a massive industry in india</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.359" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">it creates very little value though</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">because this this is low pay this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">like this is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">the factories of our age right so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">problem then is how can india become</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">more competitive by becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:39.280" style="s2">and here is a problem you can in some</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:41.119" style="s2">indian cults and some minority religions</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.280" end="00:51:42.160" style="s2">like jainisms or asians and find a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.119" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">of entrepreneurship</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.160" end="00:51:45.520" style="s2">that is very specialized and gilded the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">india&#39;s society doesn&#39;t in general have</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">an entrepreneurial spirit to it indians</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">go to america and then they become</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">bosses big companies they do not</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">necessarily innovate they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">brilliant at mimicking</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">but the problem with indian culture is</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">that because it&#39;s tied to karma it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">incredibly hard for an indian to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">allowed to make mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">i would say this is still the pagan part</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s an unforgiving</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">uh uh notion of karma again</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">i think the brilliance with christianity</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:16.079" style="s2">was properly practiced especially in</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">southern europe where</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">capitalism started was that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">root of capitalism this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:23.119" style="s2">the brilliance of capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:24.640" style="s2">capitalism started with the bazaars</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.119" end="00:52:26.240" style="s2">along the silk route</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.640" end="00:52:28.160" style="s2">what was so great about the silk road</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.240" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">and the bazaars was it just the trade</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:31.760" style="s2">no it was also the production and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">production went on all along the silk</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.760" end="00:52:34.079" style="s2">road and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">you know goods were transported back and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.079" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">forth along the silicon</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">how did that happen it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.480" end="00:52:40.400" style="s2">entrepreneurial so you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:42.160" style="s2">learned from your master but you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.400" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">also add innovation</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">so you could develop the products make</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">them better and better and improve on</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">them all the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">and to me this is the central</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">social value of forgiveness it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:56.559" style="s2">about mercy being nice to people</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">it&#39;s really about implementing an idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.559" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">that you can actually create same</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">engineering culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:04.800" style="s2">an architectural culture you could you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:05.599" style="s2">could innovate and be entrepreneurial in</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">a culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.599" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">if you add tons of forgiveness to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:11.839" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">yeah that might be right i know i</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.839" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">remember like the the tibetans never</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">invented anything other than butter tea</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">right they had this very very complex</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">deep spirituality but but they have they</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">don&#39;t have any entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:29.119" style="s2">aspect at all but still i suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">buddhism calmed down the lunch mobs in</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.119" end="00:53:32.960" style="s2">the east so why wouldn&#39;t buddhism then</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.119" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">have some kind of entrepreneurial aspect</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.960" end="00:53:36.640" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">where would entrepreneurism come from in</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">china</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:43.119" style="s2">um is it buddhism confusion is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">modalism</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.119" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">um probably doubts i don&#39;t know probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">a mix of buddhism and taoism</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be confusionism we should</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">invite a chinese person to discuss that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:54.400" style="s2">because obviously there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">entrepreneurial spirit going in china</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.400" end="00:53:58.160" style="s2">which communism then prevents and stops</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">and tries to milk</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.160" end="00:54:01.680" style="s2">but still it&#39;s happening undeniably</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">happening the chinese are</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.680" end="00:54:04.960" style="s2">inventing they have an inventing culture</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">japan</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.960" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">japan has an innovative culture they</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">have shinto islam and buddhism as the</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">two main religions korea is an</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:15.119" style="s2">innovative culture it is buddhism again</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.119" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">zoroastrianism i&#39;ve argued that zen</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:22.400" style="s2">and zion and china are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">trade route religion so that means</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">there&#39;s don&#39;t waste them in buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">you&#39;re iconoclastic as well right you</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">know you can kill the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">like uh uh you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">expression if you meet the buddha kill</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">the buddha and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:37.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of uh you can break</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">something and then and then do it again</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.839" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">probably maybe that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">there is a lot i think there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">there is there is a a a big</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">aspect of repentance uh in that culture</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:50.480" style="s2">and you you do things</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">wait i make a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.480" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">forgiveness and repentance yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:55.280" style="s2">the difference</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">repentance is that you stand before a</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">perfect god and you&#39;ve proven to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:54:59.119" style="s2">imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">so you&#39;ve done something that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">imperfect so you ask for repentance</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">meaning you&#39;re forgiven for that</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">specific acts you can go back into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:09.359" style="s2">perfect realm</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:10.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no learning involved if you do</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.359" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">repent</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.240" end="00:55:13.760" style="s2">that&#39;s so that&#39;s not that&#39;s islam that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">the problem with islam islam is strictly</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">repentance culture means that you did</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t excuse yourself for</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">doing bad you&#39;ll get killed now but then</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">you might get a second chance but</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">there&#39;s really no learning going on</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">because you stand before perfection</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">if you stand for perfection that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:29.119" style="s2">repentance</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:30.559" style="s2">that is the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.119" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">repentance and forgiveness that i find</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.559" end="00:55:35.200" style="s2">incredibly important here</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.200" end="00:55:37.359" style="s2">because you cannot create a thriving</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.200" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">entrepreneurial culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.359" end="00:55:40.880" style="s2">on religion that only allows for</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">repentance but if religion allows for</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.880" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">forgiveness and puts forgiveness at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">center you eliminate two problems</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">one you go innovative and two you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:52.319" style="s2">the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">because on this what do you think thomas</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.319" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">would you have any</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:56.880" style="s2">i think one here very good yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:59.359" style="s2">basically um</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.880" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">so so turn the other cheek is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:03.920" style="s2">mechanism to avoid escalation</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing and then but the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.920" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">other thing is as what alexander points</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:09.760" style="s2">out is also that that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:11.359" style="s2">you need to be able to you can fail and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.760" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">then learn from your mistakes and try</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:14.079" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">so these are kind of two aspects of of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.079" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">forgiveness so you avoid escalation and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:20.160" style="s2">and you you enter a learning process so</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:22.400" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.160" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">yeah that that makes a lot of sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.400" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">and the scapegoat cannot be scapegoated</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">without problems at least if the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">scapegoat can be forgiven because the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:32.319" style="s2">has done certain things that means you</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">got to go pagan</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">to kill the scapegoat you can&#39;t stay</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">within the christian realm so even if</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:39.359" style="s2">you got a christian lynch mob say going</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:41.119" style="s2">after the jew</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.359" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely correct to say that</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.119" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">stop being christians when they start</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">doing the programs that kill the jews</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">because that&#39;s not christian at all</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">i see i see paganism in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:50.799" style="s2">everywhere now after reading girard it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:52.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.799" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">it&#39;s also such a relief right because</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.960" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">now i can say like well</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">the aspects of christianity that are</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:57:00.319" style="s2">always disliked these are pagan aspects</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:02.160" style="s2">and the aspects of christianity also</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.319" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">like well this makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.160" end="00:57:05.520" style="s2">these are actually in my as far as i can</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:07.920" style="s2">understand now</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.520" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">these are actually the very old aspects</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.920" end="00:57:10.079" style="s2">of christianity that turn christianity</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.079" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">into a success like for example the so</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:17.200" style="s2">the problematic deeply problematic</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">aspects like the witch burnings and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.200" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">and you know the pogroms against the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">jews and stuff like that that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.640" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">just chris christians get going turtle</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">pagan</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s quite fascinating i mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">you see a lot of a lot of opinions now a</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:31.599" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:33.599" style="s2">people who consider themselves very very</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">christian they&#39;re not christian at all</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.599" end="00:57:36.640" style="s2">they&#39;re pagans for example also</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:39.520" style="s2">christians who very</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.640" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">who judge other religions this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.520" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">christian thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">well they got a problem we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">before and that&#39;s the elimination of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:47.839" style="s2">bard absolute so the bard absolute is</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">there and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.839" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s foundational for</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">zoroastrianism and judaism doubtlessly</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.200" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">so i mean it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:57:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s something behind the bar</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:57:59.599" style="s2">absolutely you must not go behind</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.280" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">because if the bard absolute is removed</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.599" end="00:58:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s nothing prevents you from looking</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:04.960" style="s2">straight into the eyes of god right</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.720" end="00:58:06.400" style="s2">and protestantism played this fully</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:08.079" style="s2">luther played his fault</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.400" end="00:58:09.520" style="s2">this is like lutheran cow it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">direct relationship to god</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.520" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">makes christianity unique nobody else</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">nobody else allows to talk directly to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:16.319" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">actually that is alien that is alien to</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.319" end="00:58:18.799" style="s2">people the bard absolute there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:20.960" style="s2">something between</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.799" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">humans and god and the priesthood has to</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.960" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">make sure that door is locked</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">and that is key to zoroastrianism</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">judaism and it&#39;s precisely how you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">a mass religion to go pagan is i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">paganism could sneak into christianity</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">certainly into islam the back door</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">because these religions</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:40.880" style="s2">had no barred absolute and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">have a bad absolute paganism come back</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.880" end="00:58:44.880" style="s2">can come back in because if</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:46.640" style="s2">if you have a direct access to god then</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.880" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">god is also reflected in your direct</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.640" end="00:58:51.920" style="s2">actions that means your pagan instincts</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">because it can be completely divine</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.920" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">because you know the will of god</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">people who do not follow the will of god</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">they sh they can be scapegoated is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">is that your</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:03.359" style="s2">yes yes exactly that makes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.119" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">sense so the root of fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.359" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">which is unique to christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:08.880" style="s2">islam it doesn&#39;t make any sense to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:10.160" style="s2">fundamentalism and buddhism is harassing</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.880" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">judaism because these are complex</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.160" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">religious that basically says you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.520" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">know [ __ ] anyway right</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">go it&#39;s a long path to learn by the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a part absolute at the end you</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">need to pass through it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:20.400" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:22.079" style="s2">in buddhism and it&#39;s really really hard</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">to get there right and at least it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.079" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">tantrum sutra and buddhist teachings too</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.920" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">so rasterism has the same thing it has a</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">definite bardocks which you must not go</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">the priests even have their own religion</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:32.880" style="s2">which is separate from yours</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:35.119" style="s2">you&#39;re taught a religion that works for</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.880" end="00:59:36.720" style="s2">you it&#39;s about your asha so this</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.119" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">religion you&#39;re being taught it will</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.720" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.319" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s so rationalism it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">masterism and the separate from</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:45.760" style="s2">mosleyism is</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">organism so they&#39;re separated in in</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.760" end="00:59:50.720" style="s2">judaism this is clearly the case here</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">what the jews find so disgraceful</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.720" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">about christ dying on the cross not that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:55.359" style="s2">he died on the cross and they might even</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:56.079" style="s2">have made a mistake he might have been a</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.359" end="00:59:57.440" style="s2">good man</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.079" end="00:59:59.599" style="s2">and maybe he could even teach them a</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="01:00:01.119" style="s2">lesson about scapegoating they like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.599" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">but what the jews found problematic</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.119" end="01:00:03.280" style="s2">about christ on the cross that was</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.319" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">described in the bible</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.280" end="01:00:06.319" style="s2">is that the curtain fell down in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:08.799" style="s2">temple and there was</p>

<p begin="01:00:11.119" end="01:00:15.040" style="s2">this is this is today when we see</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.799" end="01:00:17.040" style="s2">today&#39;s society with transparency</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.040" end="01:00:18.799" style="s2">and the demand for everything to be seen</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.040" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">and people opening up their their homes</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.799" end="01:00:21.359" style="s2">and everything</p>

<p begin="01:00:21.359" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">our books we call it the porn inflated</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:27.359" style="s2">this con it&#39;s constant need that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.520" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">everything opened up for everybody to</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.359" end="01:00:29.920" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:31.280" style="s2">that comes from a terrible mistake</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.920" end="01:00:32.880" style="s2">christianity in islam</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.280" end="01:00:34.319" style="s2">and this is the idea that everything</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.880" end="01:00:36.559" style="s2">should be opened up for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.319" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">because we have the divine right to see</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:41.119" style="s2">absolutely everything and see straight</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:42.960" style="s2">into the ass of god if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.119" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">and this opens the door so that when</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.960" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">paganism then comes back with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.640" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">vengeance it comes back</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">aggressively these cultures this has</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:52.319" style="s2">cursed islam and christianity</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">all along and that is the price they</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.319" end="01:00:56.559" style="s2">paid for being pop religions</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:00:58.319" style="s2">they made religion easy they packaged</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.559" end="01:01:00.400" style="s2">themselves to sell it to the masses</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.319" end="01:01:02.480" style="s2">i i i just say i disagree i think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.400" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">you are being way too harsh on both</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.480" end="01:01:06.079" style="s2">christianity and islam i think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:07.920" style="s2">you know islam has been around for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.079" end="01:01:09.920" style="s2">long time you know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">if you&#39;ve seen a building like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.920" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">alhambra right i mean you can see like</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">what what</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:15.760" style="s2">incredible beautiful things islam can</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">can can accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.760" end="01:01:18.799" style="s2">so i think that all religions will have</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.400" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.799" end="01:01:22.079" style="s2">non-functional pop part that is like</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.079" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">you know kind of a perversion and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:26.559" style="s2">they will have a core that is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:27.839" style="s2">like well you know this is the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">that actually makes it work</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.839" end="01:01:31.119" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s very interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">look at religions like like that so</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.119" end="01:01:35.119" style="s2">so i i will gladly take you to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">guardians of yas did iran you see the</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.119" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">world hamburgers mimicked from it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:42.000" style="s2">from a muslim heritage at all</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:43.599" style="s2">so no i i disagree that islam really has</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.000" end="01:01:44.240" style="s2">contributed as much as being claimed i</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.599" end="01:01:45.839" style="s2">mean because</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.240" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">has been the world religion for 1400</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.839" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">years actually i&#39;m kind of like more</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">proposing a research project because</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:54.799" style="s2">you know gerard has has has done very</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:57.039" style="s2">little with respect to other religions</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.799" end="01:01:59.119" style="s2">i mean he he wrote one book about uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.039" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">about brahmanism i believe</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.119" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">but uh i haven&#39;t read it yet it&#39;s on my</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">to-do list but he hasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:06.400" style="s2">he he limited himself very much to</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.559" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">christianity i think that the gerardian</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.400" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">project should look at other religions</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">like buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:13.520" style="s2">sutra and tantric buddhism and islam and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:16.000" style="s2">basically see like how how do they</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.520" end="01:02:17.520" style="s2">these religions work and why did they</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.000" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">stick around so long</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.520" end="01:02:20.799" style="s2">because most religions they just they</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:22.720" style="s2">just come up and they disappear right</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.799" end="01:02:24.079" style="s2">yeah why are these religions successful</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.720" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">so what made them</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.079" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">and most functional and what makes them</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:29.200" style="s2">dysfunctional i think these are very</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:31.839" style="s2">interesting questions</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.200" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">most of buddhism is is probably pop</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.839" end="01:02:36.079" style="s2">religion too i mean people in in</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:37.280" style="s2">people believe in the pure land and</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.079" end="01:02:38.960" style="s2">they&#39;re going to go to the pure land</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.280" end="01:02:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very very pop religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.960" end="01:02:41.599" style="s2">most of it i would say probably but</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.400" end="01:02:42.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the fact that i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.599" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">function of that i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.960" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2">function there needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:47.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s a false religion version of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:48.799" style="s2">it don&#39;t mistake that for the proper</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:50.480" style="s2">religion in this case</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.799" end="01:02:51.839" style="s2">well i mean there&#39;s a billion buddhists</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.480" end="01:02:54.559" style="s2">and most of them are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.839" end="01:02:56.319" style="s2">sort of i mean there&#39;s always there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.559" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">people who always</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.319" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">turn it into something that that works</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:01.359" style="s2">and which which works at a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">superficial level right</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.359" end="01:03:04.640" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s always going to happen that</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:07.599" style="s2">happens with buddhism hinduism</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.640" end="01:03:08.240" style="s2">christianity yeah but don&#39;t flatten it</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:09.920" style="s2">out here</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.240" end="01:03:11.599" style="s2">we must be able to criticize certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.920" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">religions for certain basic talents they</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.599" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">believe in they are different</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">after all and i think islam was popular</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:18.559" style="s2">because it was simplistic</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:20.480" style="s2">and that has been its curse ever since</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.559" end="01:03:21.920" style="s2">and the really simplistic religions if</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.480" end="01:03:24.079" style="s2">we want to simplistic religious</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.920" end="01:03:25.839" style="s2">we have a we have a reversed order of</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.079" end="01:03:27.760" style="s2">the silk road tribe that we of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.839" end="01:03:29.520" style="s2">admire we love zarastis and buddhism and</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.760" end="01:03:30.000" style="s2">dallas and that&#39;s the situation i really</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.520" end="01:03:32.640" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.000" end="01:03:34.559" style="s2">grounded now but um the other version of</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.640" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">that is the disney world triad</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.559" end="01:03:37.359" style="s2">the district will try to jehovah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:38.559" style="s2">witnesses and hormones and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.359" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">scientologists</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.559" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">so as you can see religion has gone on a</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">downward slope the last five thousand</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:44.960" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:46.720" style="s2">yet up with the most vulgar silliest</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:47.839" style="s2">versions of it in america in the last</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.720" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">100 years</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.839" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">so you know the the disabled tribe is</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">interesting for a comparative study with</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:56.079" style="s2">buddhism and daoism or westernism</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">what really happens when you go pop</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.079" end="01:04:00.480" style="s2">culture in terms of religion i mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:01.200" style="s2">scientology is just hysterical in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.480" end="01:04:03.680" style="s2">sense it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.200" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just you you pay your way to go to</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.680" end="01:04:07.680" style="s2">different planets</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:08.559" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s just yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.680" end="01:04:10.720" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.559" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">actually that religion can go that far</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.720" end="01:04:14.160" style="s2">and get that silly</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">and you can&#39;t compare those religions</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.160" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">with the traditions we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:18.960" style="s2">what about the catholic church for</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">example that is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.960" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">is that a pop religion or i mean most of</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:23.920" style="s2">it or</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a folk religion element that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.920" end="01:04:26.880" style="s2">why you added the saints</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:29.520" style="s2">and that was smart that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.880" end="01:04:31.599" style="s2">catholicism will survive protestantism</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.520" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">prosthetism is dying catholicism will</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.599" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">still be around for a long time to come</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">and and simply because it allows for a</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">folk religion which you can talk to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:39.359" style="s2">saints and the saints will then talk to</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:41.760" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.359" end="01:04:43.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve reinstated the bardab suit in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.760" end="01:04:45.280" style="s2">very clever way</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.680" end="01:04:46.720" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.280" end="01:04:48.160" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.720" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">thought but then they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.160" end="01:04:51.200" style="s2">actually reinstated i mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">basically what i pointed out right so</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.200" end="01:04:53.760" style="s2">that you will have like</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">you will have like let&#39;s say pop</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.760" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">religion and then you have something</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:04:57.520" style="s2">like let&#39;s say something that is a bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.720" end="01:05:00.240" style="s2">less uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.520" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">a bit more refined so and and i guess</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.240" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like that with all religions right</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:05.599" style="s2">so then you would kind of would kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:07.839" style="s2">expect</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.599" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">a certain certain religion has a court</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.839" end="01:05:11.520" style="s2">that that is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:12.880" style="s2">to some extent integrated and valuable</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.520" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">and then and then a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.880" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">of uh of stuff on top of that that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:19.440" style="s2">could call pop religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:21.200" style="s2">yeah you had the same thing in islam you</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.440" end="01:05:23.520" style="s2">have you have sufism that</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.200" end="01:05:24.960" style="s2">came along along the silk route and was</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.520" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">devised essentially it&#39;s harassed in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.960" end="01:05:28.079" style="s2">buddhist teachings developed under an</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:29.520" style="s2">islamic umbrella and of course it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.079" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">most interesting part</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.520" end="01:05:33.680" style="s2">artistically theologically anything you</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:35.359" style="s2">like within islam is sufism and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.680" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">very little islamic to be honest about</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:40.079" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s just it just yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:42.160" style="s2">catholicism you know realized we need a</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.079" end="01:05:44.480" style="s2">bard absolute okay so</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.160" end="01:05:46.480" style="s2">have martyrs so then become saints</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.480" end="01:05:48.559" style="s2">they&#39;re not scapegoats because</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.480" end="01:05:50.480" style="s2">scapegoating ended with christ no</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.559" end="01:05:51.359" style="s2">they&#39;re models role models so you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.480" end="01:05:52.799" style="s2">actually talk to them</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.359" end="01:05:54.480" style="s2">and because they live this fulfilling</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.799" end="01:05:56.559" style="s2">and rich lives the church</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.480" end="01:05:57.920" style="s2">in communication with god is decided we</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.559" end="01:05:58.640" style="s2">can turn these into role models or</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.920" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">forefathers</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.640" end="01:06:01.839" style="s2">or four mothers that you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:03.119" style="s2">pray to so you don&#39;t have just virgin</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.839" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">mary harry all of a sudden have all</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.119" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">these scents you can pray to</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:08.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a much richer religion than</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:09.760" style="s2">protestantism that then comes much later</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.480" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">and says that oh we&#39;re going to print</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.760" end="01:06:12.880" style="s2">the bible because to print the bible</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:13.839" style="s2">your local language will have direct</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.880" end="01:06:15.599" style="s2">access to god</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.839" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">so he can remove all the saints and</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.599" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">clean out all the churches to make the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">minimalists</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:23.760" style="s2">has looked at that so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.319" end="01:06:26.240" style="s2">scholar barth</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.760" end="01:06:27.680" style="s2">um which probably you know considered</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.240" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">one of the greatest theologians of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.680" end="01:06:30.480" style="s2">20th century and</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.720" end="01:06:33.440" style="s2">one of the things that he pointed out is</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.480" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">that well there&#39;s no god behind jesus</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.440" end="01:06:37.039" style="s2">so he was aware of this problem i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:39.599" style="s2">and he solved it by saying well you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.039" end="01:06:41.280" style="s2">often christians think of you know you</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.599" end="01:06:42.559" style="s2">have jesus and then god is behind that</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.280" end="01:06:43.119" style="s2">right from something in the sky that</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.559" end="01:06:44.960" style="s2">looks down</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">and he points out well jesus is the only</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.960" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">thing you have there&#39;s no god behind</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:50.079" style="s2">jesus</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:53.359" style="s2">you can&#39;t decouple it and that is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.079" end="01:06:55.839" style="s2">is a very interesting thought</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.359" end="01:06:56.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the saurus and mastan ahura</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.839" end="01:06:58.000" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.400" end="01:07:00.480" style="s2">they&#39;re both primordial in</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.000" end="01:07:02.480" style="s2">zoroastrianism they&#39;re not personified</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.480" end="01:07:04.559" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of like why zizek would say</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.480" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">that uh you know be a christian atheist</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.559" end="01:07:07.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:08.640" style="s2">of some kind if there&#39;s no guide behind</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.119" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">jesus then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.640" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">just man right it seems that i ended up</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">somewhere uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:16.160" style="s2">somewhere along that part yes yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:18.079" style="s2">the kind of escape what the theologians</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.160" end="01:07:21.119" style="s2">did in the 20th century but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.079" end="01:07:22.880" style="s2">uh back to orthodoxy and orthodoxy gets</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.119" end="01:07:25.119" style="s2">into the same problem the way to try to</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.880" end="01:07:27.599" style="s2">solve is by going modest so</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.119" end="01:07:28.559" style="s2">neoplatonism is dominated in orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.599" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">theology</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.559" end="01:07:31.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s if you convert to orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">christian it&#39;s probably because of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.520" end="01:07:34.720" style="s2">modest worldview you don&#39;t buy into the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:36.880" style="s2">platelet dualism</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.720" end="01:07:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the new plate and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.880" end="01:07:39.680" style="s2">shaped orthodoxy and that was a major</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.880" end="01:07:41.359" style="s2">shift for them</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:43.280" style="s2">that&#39;s how they tried to solve the bard</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.359" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">absolute because the bard absolutes is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.280" end="01:07:46.160" style="s2">automatically reinstated if you go for a</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:49.440" style="s2">modest world view</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.160" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the price you pay for monism</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.440" end="01:07:57.039" style="s2">okay unpack that a bit okay so</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">if you go for dualism your soul can be</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.039" end="01:08:00.400" style="s2">free from your body</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:02.880" style="s2">your soul can then be perceived as being</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.400" end="01:08:04.000" style="s2">divine and that allows for the bard</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.880" end="01:08:05.599" style="s2">absolute to be removed</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.000" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">that&#39;s what all gnostics are trying all</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.599" end="01:08:09.280" style="s2">the time they realize they cannot become</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:11.280" style="s2">divine in the human body</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.280" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">so they hate the body consider their own</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.280" end="01:08:14.480" style="s2">spirit to be superior</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:16.159" style="s2">to the body and suddenly it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.480" end="01:08:16.960" style="s2">superior to anything else inside this</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.159" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">divine</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.960" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">so gnostics tend to be very</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:22.480" style="s2">self-preoccupied narcissists usually</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:23.759" style="s2">pillar saints who think of themselves</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.480" end="01:08:25.440" style="s2">being superior to others and</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.759" end="01:08:27.440" style="s2">usually very envious of other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.440" end="01:08:29.279" style="s2">sex lives okay that&#39;s the probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.440" end="01:08:30.960" style="s2">gnostics</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.279" end="01:08:32.239" style="s2">so rasters knew it and they just wanted</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.960" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">to get rid of them they just they</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.239" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">weren&#39;t even heretics they were just</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:35.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:37.679" style="s2">trash it&#39;s just like get them out of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.839" end="01:08:39.199" style="s2">way like marx would consider the lump</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.679" end="01:08:40.480" style="s2">and proletariat just they&#39;re out of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:41.520" style="s2">way they&#39;re destroying our revolution</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.480" end="01:08:42.799" style="s2">get them out of the way</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.520" end="01:08:45.359" style="s2">so there were the gnostics and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.799" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">gnosticism stayed because of dualism and</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.359" end="01:08:48.159" style="s2">the radical dude is of course separation</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">of body mind means that</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.159" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">all of the world is the dual means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.960" end="01:08:53.920" style="s2">not unified</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not connected it&#39;s evil and good or</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.920" end="01:08:58.080" style="s2">whatever that can&#39;t be unified at all</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.920" end="01:08:59.520" style="s2">your body your mind cannot be unified</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.080" end="01:09:01.120" style="s2">and you have to pick one of them and</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.520" end="01:09:02.400" style="s2">then if you go for the mind you got to</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.120" end="01:09:04.239" style="s2">get rid of the body and then you start</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:05.600" style="s2">hating sexuality and in through the door</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:07.120" style="s2">you got the problem sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.600" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">christianity created because of except</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.120" end="01:09:09.839" style="s2">for dualism</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.839" end="01:09:12.239" style="s2">now in modernism you don&#39;t accept that</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.839" end="01:09:14.560" style="s2">everything is tied to everything else</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.239" end="01:09:16.640" style="s2">but you can allow as many attributes as</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.560" end="01:09:19.920" style="s2">you like so for example god can have</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.640" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">different faces and still be one god</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.920" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.440" end="01:09:29.600" style="s2">elohim in judaism elohim is a pluralist</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.480" end="01:09:30.319" style="s2">you don&#39;t say allah you say yeah you say</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.600" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">gods</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.319" end="01:09:33.359" style="s2">for god meaning you got yava and you got</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.359" end="01:09:37.040" style="s2">and you got adonai and they&#39;re separated</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.600" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">and the same thing is rasterism you</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.040" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">separate mastanura they&#39;re not separate</p>

<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:44.480" style="s2">they&#39;re just different names for god</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:48.319" style="s2">they&#39;re usually used separately</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.480" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">because being and master is mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.319" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">and because mind is within being and</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">being as</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.440" end="01:09:55.280" style="s2">is within mind in zoroastrianism they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:09:58.480" style="s2">in parallel with one another</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:10:01.840" style="s2">and they together are the divine</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.480" end="01:10:03.679" style="s2">so you look up to the divine and try to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.840" end="01:10:06.080" style="s2">model yourself accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.679" end="01:10:08.880" style="s2">so you might have role models in between</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.080" end="01:10:10.640" style="s2">say mobeds or ushas or military leaders</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.880" end="01:10:12.080" style="s2">whenever you look up to your mentor or</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.640" end="01:10:13.600" style="s2">your father or your mother whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.080" end="01:10:15.520" style="s2">you look up to other role models in your</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.600" end="01:10:16.960" style="s2">life and you try to mimic them to be as</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.520" end="01:10:19.760" style="s2">they are and grow up</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.960" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">and you have a divine ideal that then</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">grown-ups look up to and then grown-ups</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:25.520" style="s2">become models for children</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:26.880" style="s2">so you got a chain here of things you</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.520" end="01:10:28.960" style="s2">should mimic that&#39;s how they solve the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.880" end="01:10:31.280" style="s2">mimiky the problematic desire</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.960" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">so the that&#39;s the rasterism version of</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:34.480" style="s2">that and you can do that within a modest</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.480" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">but then the bird absolute comes in</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">because for the child</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.800" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">the grown-ups are about absolute you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:45.280" style="s2">literally three years old</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.320" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">you&#39;re three you&#39;re not 30. when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.280" end="01:10:48.560" style="s2">30 years old you&#39;re literally not</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.960" end="01:10:50.000" style="s2">90. you cannot be an elder when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.560" end="01:10:51.679" style="s2">30 years old you&#39;re probably in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.000" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">middle of your reproductive phase you</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.679" end="01:10:54.960" style="s2">work hard you have kids right</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:56.960" style="s2">you can then become an elder what do the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.960" end="01:10:58.400" style="s2">elders do the elders look up to assumed</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.960" end="01:10:59.760" style="s2">and look up to the priesthood</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.400" end="01:11:01.679" style="s2">and the priesthood then look up to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.760" end="01:11:03.040" style="s2">divine so there&#39;s always somebody you</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.679" end="01:11:06.239" style="s2">look up to who you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.040" end="01:11:08.159" style="s2">yet at and you take this is a rasterism</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.239" end="01:11:11.199" style="s2">all the way to your death</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.159" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">and when when you die you strive for a</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.199" end="01:11:15.840" style="s2">mere thought which is transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:17.520" style="s2">but you reach harvard which is fullness</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.840" end="01:11:19.440" style="s2">so you reach fullness and you die you</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.520" end="01:11:21.679" style="s2">can go to peace and you can die</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.440" end="01:11:22.560" style="s2">because a meditation will then be your</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.679" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">heritage</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.560" end="01:11:25.679" style="s2">so whatever you created during your life</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:28.159" style="s2">will then be inherited</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:30.000" style="s2">and used by others to create an even</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.159" end="01:11:31.199" style="s2">better world which is zoroastrianism&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.000" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">unique points</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.199" end="01:11:34.480" style="s2">and this this idea of fraction of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:36.719" style="s2">ever-improving world</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.480" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">is central to zerastreamism you can only</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.719" end="01:11:40.159" style="s2">do that with the bard absolutely you</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:42.400" style="s2">have several board absolutes on the way</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.159" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">but if you remove them like islamic</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.400" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">christianity did</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:47.440" style="s2">there&#39;s not even a difference between a</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:49.040" style="s2">child and a god</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.440" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">there&#39;s no coincidence that you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.040" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">child gods and god children in these</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:54.159" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:55.679" style="s2">they do not exist in judaism they did</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.159" end="01:11:57.679" style="s2">not exist in buddhism they did not</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.679" end="01:12:00.159" style="s2">existed zoroastrianism the idea that god</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.679" end="01:12:01.760" style="s2">can be a child and the child can be god</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.159" end="01:12:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s actually what i would say is islam</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.760" end="01:12:05.199" style="s2">and christianity&#39;s problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.360" end="01:12:07.600" style="s2">so you get allah who is a boy who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.199" end="01:12:10.800" style="s2">god and in christianity you get</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.600" end="01:12:11.360" style="s2">the boy who&#39;s born with wisdom so this</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.800" end="01:12:13.199" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.360" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">critical question in christianity you</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.199" end="01:12:16.400" style="s2">you get the boy in the cradle</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">he&#39;s apparently god so he must be</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.400" end="01:12:19.840" style="s2">perfect and he must have ultimate wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:21.120" style="s2">he&#39;s never lived in life how can you</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.840" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">have ultimate wisdom he hasn&#39;t lived</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.120" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">alive</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:25.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s of course why he goes all the</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:27.679" style="s2">way to the cross you don&#39;t ever hear</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.120" end="01:12:29.199" style="s2">about his sex life</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.679" end="01:12:31.440" style="s2">because if he had a sex life he would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.199" end="01:12:33.440" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.440" end="01:12:35.199" style="s2">so he starts with a mother next team in</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.440" end="01:12:36.320" style="s2">the cradle and he ends up on the cross</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.199" end="01:12:38.880" style="s2">next to his mother</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.320" end="01:12:40.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s essentially a boy pharaoh all</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.880" end="01:12:42.640" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.159" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">no i i don&#39;t really agree that with that</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.640" end="01:12:47.760" style="s2">i mean the whole point of of uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">of of crisis just to to expose the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.760" end="01:12:52.320" style="s2">victimization mechanism that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.080" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">that&#39;s it i mean in that sense christ</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.320" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t really i mean is an example in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:58.159" style="s2">sense that um</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:12:59.520" style="s2">that he avoids the memetic escalation</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.159" end="01:13:03.040" style="s2">and things like that but</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.520" end="01:13:06.320" style="s2">i mean you can&#39;t just take christ as a</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.040" end="01:13:08.640" style="s2">as a uh as a role model it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.320" end="01:13:11.440" style="s2">no no no no i&#39;m not saying i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.640" end="01:13:14.719" style="s2">that the problem is a religion the boy</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.440" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">and god are the same thing if you remove</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.719" end="01:13:19.440" style="s2">the bar dab so that&#39;s what you get</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.880" end="01:13:21.440" style="s2">because the barred absolutes that we go</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.440" end="01:13:22.159" style="s2">through in life are the things we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.440" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">yet be</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.159" end="01:13:27.280" style="s2">but that we strive towards that is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:28.640" style="s2">point with taunton too sutra is there to</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.280" end="01:13:30.400" style="s2">strive towards tantra</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.640" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">you can stay in sutra and be a</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.400" end="01:13:34.000" style="s2">reasonable citizen in a society</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">and you can just find out the tantra is</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.000" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">too hard for you to stomach</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:39.040" style="s2">then don&#39;t go there you&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">stay within the sutra and be</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.040" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2">perfectly okay actually if you go into</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.280" end="01:13:43.679" style="s2">the tantic mode and you weren&#39;t prepared</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.040" end="01:13:45.600" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.679" end="01:13:47.199" style="s2">and you went in there anyway you [ __ ] up</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.600" end="01:13:50.320" style="s2">yourself miserably and become a drug</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.199" end="01:13:50.320" style="s2">abuse and all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.560" end="01:13:55.520" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s exactly the point with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.800" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">bard absolute that&#39;s why buddhism has it</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.520" end="01:13:58.880" style="s2">your religion has it my religion has it</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:00.080" style="s2">judaism has it</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.880" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">the problem was that islamic</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.080" end="01:14:03.520" style="s2">christianity removed it to turn</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.840" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">themselves into pop religions</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.520" end="01:14:06.880" style="s2">and the really absurd versions of that</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:07.600" style="s2">the disallowing disa world tribe in</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.880" end="01:14:09.840" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.600" end="01:14:11.600" style="s2">have no idea what a bard absolute even</p>

<p begin="01:14:11.600" end="01:14:15.600" style="s2">that is problematic the prohibition that</p>

<p begin="01:14:53.199" end="01:14:57.360" style="s2">the secret torah and you have the oral</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.960" end="01:14:59.040" style="s2">torah the oral torah is what moses gave</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.360" end="01:15:00.640" style="s2">the jews with all these rules</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.040" end="01:15:02.239" style="s2">they have to follow and that was a</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.640" end="01:15:03.120" style="s2">punishment because they weren&#39;t ready</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.239" end="01:15:05.120" style="s2">for the secret</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.120" end="01:15:06.800" style="s2">for the they weren&#39;t ready to get the</p>

<p begin="01:15:06.800" end="01:15:10.880" style="s2">they weren&#39;t ready for that so actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.640" end="01:15:12.320" style="s2">the torah that the oral torah is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.880" end="01:15:14.640" style="s2">punishment to prepare</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.320" end="01:15:15.440" style="s2">prayer was a punishment from god</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.640" end="01:15:16.960" style="s2">apparently</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.440" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">whereas whereas the real thing is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.960" end="01:15:22.159" style="s2">sikh is the is the um</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">is it is the um the secret torah not the</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.159" end="01:15:25.120" style="s2">secretary</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.880" end="01:15:26.080" style="s2">the other just the oral torah the direct</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.120" end="01:15:29.520" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.080" end="01:15:32.320" style="s2">right i see this i see this</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:34.159" style="s2">like past the bard absolute there are</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.320" end="01:15:35.440" style="s2">there are there are there are no stages</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.159" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">and rules and</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.440" end="01:15:40.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s no suture anymore um</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:41.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s when you meet that but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:42.560" style="s2">right yeah you have to be prepared for</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.920" end="01:15:44.880" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.560" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">so so uh no there&#39;s no sutra in your</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.880" end="01:15:47.600" style="s2">life but you need to teach sutra to</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:49.840" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.600" end="01:15:51.760" style="s2">that&#39;s we become a real leader sure</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.840" end="01:15:52.400" style="s2">right that&#39;s why the jewish religion is</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.760" end="01:15:54.880" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.400" end="01:15:56.880" style="s2">i find this fascinating because the</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.880" end="01:15:58.719" style="s2">natural reaction today especially among</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.880" end="01:16:00.320" style="s2">young smart men and we have quite a few</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.719" end="01:16:01.600" style="s2">of them around us in the election deep</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.320" end="01:16:03.679" style="s2">web in other places</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.600" end="01:16:05.199" style="s2">is that they all go for alchemy and they</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.679" end="01:16:07.600" style="s2">want to invent sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.199" end="01:16:09.280" style="s2">an intelligent credible real version of</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.600" end="01:16:09.840" style="s2">chaos magic and things like that right</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.280" end="01:16:12.320" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.840" end="01:16:14.159" style="s2">they&#39;re really going towards freemasonry</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:17.280" style="s2">and orders again</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.159" end="01:16:19.199" style="s2">uh that that is the bard absolute in</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.280" end="01:16:20.800" style="s2">sort of civil life that&#39;s the civil west</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.199" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.800" end="01:16:24.400" style="s2">you would go into those orders because</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.560" end="01:16:25.600" style="s2">if religion was too childish and forgave</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.400" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">you for anything you did you could at</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.600" end="01:16:29.120" style="s2">least go into these orders which then</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:31.280" style="s2">became part of religion</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.120" end="01:16:33.120" style="s2">and i think they were again invented to</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.280" end="01:16:34.960" style="s2">sort of back up the lack for bard</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.120" end="01:16:36.719" style="s2">absolutes within christianity</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.960" end="01:16:38.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s why freemasonry for example</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.719" end="01:16:39.520" style="s2">which is the beauty of the united states</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.159" end="01:16:41.520" style="s2">of america is the constitution was</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.520" end="01:16:42.880" style="s2">created by freemasons they did</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.520" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">fantastic things and they were very</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.880" end="01:16:47.280" style="s2">inspired by persians through the french</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:49.360" style="s2">and i love these traditions because</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.280" end="01:16:51.040" style="s2">because i i think it&#39;s very healthy but</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.360" end="01:16:52.719" style="s2">the the reaction from guys that go</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.040" end="01:16:54.400" style="s2">anti-walk after they&#39;re tired of being</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.719" end="01:16:55.600" style="s2">anti and they want to be active rather</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.400" end="01:16:57.679" style="s2">than reactive</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.600" end="01:16:59.600" style="s2">is that patrick ryan does this daniel</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.679" end="01:17:01.600" style="s2">faraga does this owen cox does it</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.600" end="01:17:03.440" style="s2">all these guys they&#39;re really sincerely</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.600" end="01:17:04.800" style="s2">interested in alcohol and chaos magic</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.440" end="01:17:06.400" style="s2">but not from the point of like</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.800" end="01:17:08.080" style="s2">i&#39;m a teenager trying to find my</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.400" end="01:17:09.600" style="s2">identity this is cool thing to do you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.080" end="01:17:11.040" style="s2">going to satanist death cults or</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.600" end="01:17:11.440" style="s2">whatever i&#39;ll listen to every metal no</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.040" end="01:17:13.360" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.440" end="01:17:15.040" style="s2">they are serious about this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:16.239" style="s2">serious about rewriting the history of</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.040" end="01:17:19.520" style="s2">the alchemists</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.239" end="01:17:21.679" style="s2">and um i find that interesting it is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.520" end="01:17:25.440" style="s2">rediscovery of the bard episode how</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.679" end="01:17:27.440" style="s2">incredibly important it is for culture</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.440" end="01:17:28.800" style="s2">and maybe we&#39;re finally then waking up</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.440" end="01:17:31.280" style="s2">to what i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.800" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">going towards here which is what i call</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.280" end="01:17:35.679" style="s2">the adultification of religion and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:38.400" style="s2">adultification of the west</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.679" end="01:17:40.640" style="s2">yeah the principal exploitation has to</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.400" end="01:17:42.320" style="s2">be replaced by the principle implotation</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.640" end="01:17:44.320" style="s2">we have to preach equitopianists and we</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.320" end="01:17:46.000" style="s2">have to preach cosmopolitanism we also</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.320" end="01:17:46.880" style="s2">have to preach the tower of god which</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.000" end="01:17:48.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.880" end="01:17:49.679" style="s2">there are certain things you cannot</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.159" end="01:17:51.600" style="s2">achieve in your life you will have to</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.679" end="01:17:54.000" style="s2">die before those things can be achieved</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.600" end="01:17:56.560" style="s2">maybe your children will okay that is</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.000" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">the bard episode in its absolute form</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.560" end="01:17:59.760" style="s2">and we call it the tower of god in our</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:00.480" style="s2">work next to the garden of god and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.760" end="01:18:02.159" style="s2">city of god</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.480" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">but i think that these ideas are coming</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.159" end="01:18:06.159" style="s2">back they&#39;re all built on the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.400" end="01:18:08.000" style="s2">if you don&#39;t reinstate the bard</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.159" end="01:18:09.199" style="s2">absolutely dramatically and this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.000" end="01:18:11.679" style="s2">of course teaching tantra</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.199" end="01:18:13.760" style="s2">philosophically to the west</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.679" end="01:18:14.719" style="s2">there is no way the west could achieve</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.760" end="01:18:17.360" style="s2">any of this i mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.719" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">the direct access society the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.360" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">shortcut society</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.880" end="01:18:23.120" style="s2">the quick fix society all these</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:24.960" style="s2">pathologies we see today that</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.120" end="01:18:26.480" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna have it and i&#39;m gonna have it</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.960" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.480" end="01:18:30.880" style="s2">that the commercialism you know brought</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">in that if i want this i can have it no</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.880" end="01:18:34.400" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:36.080" style="s2">actually you probably never can have it</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:37.840" style="s2">even if you try it you won&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.080" end="01:18:39.440" style="s2">yeah and why is that what if you did</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.840" end="01:18:41.199" style="s2">meet god directly like</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.440" end="01:18:43.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t that the ultimate religious</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.199" end="01:18:45.199" style="s2">prohibition that&#39;s needed today is to</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.280" end="01:18:46.880" style="s2">stop this porn inflation and the mass</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.199" end="01:18:47.199" style="s2">narcissism and the world culture and all</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.880" end="01:18:49.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.199" end="01:18:50.880" style="s2">is to go back and say no you will not</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.040" end="01:18:52.719" style="s2">have any of these things or at least</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.880" end="01:18:54.159" style="s2">very few of them and only if they fit</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.719" end="01:18:55.840" style="s2">your archetypes you can serve the</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.159" end="01:18:56.719" style="s2">community by having them and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.840" end="01:19:00.159" style="s2">to take you</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.719" end="01:19:00.159" style="s2">years and years to get it</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.400" end="01:19:03.520" style="s2">this is the bird absolute i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.840" end="01:19:04.159" style="s2">absolutely key it&#39;s the end chapter of</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.520" end="01:19:06.320" style="s2">our book</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.159" end="01:19:07.679" style="s2">we tied to the dark renaissance and the</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.679" end="01:19:10.400" style="s2">but we&#39;re going to end the book on that</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:11.840" style="s2">note and we&#39;re not going to end the book</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.400" end="01:19:13.679" style="s2">with forgiveness we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.840" end="01:19:15.360" style="s2">end up with some sort of syrupy ending</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.679" end="01:19:16.719" style="s2">saying yeah i know some of those gotta</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.360" end="01:19:17.760" style="s2">come along and save us early third time</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.719" end="01:19:19.440" style="s2">at all i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.760" end="01:19:21.120" style="s2">exactly the wrong message today</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.440" end="01:19:21.760" style="s2">absolutely this is here so don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.120" end="01:19:24.239" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.760" end="01:19:25.040" style="s2">no not at all the sausage can be a</p>

<p begin="01:20:10.800" end="01:20:14.639" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a good overall title</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:16.800" style="s2">for sure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.639" end="01:20:18.000" style="s2">that makes sense to me but forgiveness</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.800" end="01:20:19.679" style="s2">has to be in here i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.000" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">getting this raster version of it i</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.679" end="01:20:22.800" style="s2">think i can get the jewish version</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:25.199" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in the christian version</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.800" end="01:20:26.719" style="s2">of it not because subscribe to it i</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.199" end="01:20:27.679" style="s2">think it&#39;s a bit of a cheap shot i think</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:30.480" style="s2">bitch&#39;s critique</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.679" end="01:20:33.280" style="s2">was irrelevant but it has worked it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.480" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">worked wonderfully</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.280" end="01:20:36.719" style="s2">it is it is why christianity is being</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:37.840" style="s2">imported in korea and china at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.719" end="01:20:39.600" style="s2">moment it&#39;s only because</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.840" end="01:20:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s associated with prosperity and</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.600" end="01:20:43.520" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.520" end="01:20:45.040" style="s2">so if buddhism didn&#39;t provide enough</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.520" end="01:20:46.560" style="s2">innovation energy</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.040" end="01:20:48.400" style="s2">to the chinese and the koreans and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.560" end="01:20:50.320" style="s2">taiwanese they&#39;re certainly now on a</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.400" end="01:20:52.239" style="s2">massive scale importing christianity</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.320" end="01:20:53.760" style="s2">the vulgar protestant american version</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.239" end="01:20:57.440" style="s2">of it so what</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.760" end="01:20:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s all about try and try again</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:01.120" style="s2">and americans do try and they fail and</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.920" end="01:21:04.000" style="s2">they try again</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.120" end="01:21:05.920" style="s2">interesting at least before they became</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.000" end="01:21:09.760" style="s2">woke</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.920" end="01:21:10.800" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s essential to the heroic</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.760" end="01:21:11.600" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been talking about for years</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.800" end="01:21:13.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.600" end="01:21:15.120" style="s2">i&#39;ve never talked about the heroic being</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.040" end="01:21:16.880" style="s2">tied to forgiveness but i absolutely now</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.120" end="01:21:20.400" style="s2">see the connection</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.880" end="01:21:21.840" style="s2">and i&#39;m still interested in buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.400" end="01:21:23.920" style="s2">must have worked a lot with this</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.840" end="01:21:26.239" style="s2">compared to hinduism and</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.920" end="01:21:28.239" style="s2">asian paganism so i&#39;m interested how</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.239" end="01:21:29.520" style="s2">buddhism solved that problem how you get</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.239" end="01:21:31.280" style="s2">out of the karma circle</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.520" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">not too cheaply that was nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.280" end="01:21:35.280" style="s2">point his criticism of</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:37.840" style="s2">christianity was not you couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.280" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">out of the circle it was rather that you</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.840" end="01:21:41.120" style="s2">got out too deeply</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.120" end="01:21:42.880" style="s2">again the whole point is to get out and</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.120" end="01:21:44.800" style="s2">get out of the circle and in buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.880" end="01:21:46.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the entire</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.800" end="01:21:48.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the entire point is to get out of</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.400" end="01:21:50.560" style="s2">the the wheel</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.960" end="01:21:52.239" style="s2">but that&#39;s your next life and the next</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.560" end="01:21:54.000" style="s2">life of the next life or can we give</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.239" end="01:21:55.440" style="s2">reincarnation here and say that buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.000" end="01:21:56.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really preach reincarnation oh</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.440" end="01:21:57.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t you don&#39;t need to you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.960" end="01:21:59.679" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.440" end="01:22:01.199" style="s2">the reincarnation is irrelevant to that</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.679" end="01:22:03.679" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re trying to wake up</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.199" end="01:22:05.360" style="s2">you know out of the karmas but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.679" end="01:22:06.480" style="s2">going to save yourself in that sense you</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.360" end="01:22:08.239" style="s2">must forgive yourself</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.480" end="01:22:10.320" style="s2">how does it work it&#39;s just i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.239" end="01:22:11.920" style="s2">fascinated with because obviously it has</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.320" end="01:22:12.960" style="s2">at least partly solved this problem</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.920" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">because there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.960" end="01:22:16.239" style="s2">less lynch mobbing in the culture which</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.639" end="01:22:17.840" style="s2">to me is evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.239" end="01:22:19.520" style="s2">somehow there&#39;s a forgiveness mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.840" end="01:22:20.880" style="s2">working because i think the forgiveness</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.520" end="01:22:23.600" style="s2">mechanism is what</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.880" end="01:22:24.000" style="s2">ultimately de-instrumentalizes the lynch</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.600" end="01:22:26.719" style="s2">mod</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.000" end="01:22:28.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just they hate when you say</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.719" end="01:22:30.400" style="s2">there&#39;s forgiveness because if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.400" end="01:22:33.040" style="s2">allow forgiveness they can&#39;t kill the</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.400" end="01:22:36.000" style="s2">bait yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.040" end="01:22:37.679" style="s2">well if you it can&#39;t at least they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.000" end="01:22:38.239" style="s2">kill the bait without being guilty for</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.679" end="01:22:40.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.239" end="01:22:41.520" style="s2">and they don&#39;t want the guilt they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.480" end="01:22:43.040" style="s2">want the guilt they don&#39;t want the shame</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.520" end="01:22:43.760" style="s2">they&#39;re terrified of that the lyrical</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.040" end="01:22:46.480" style="s2">wants</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.760" end="01:22:47.199" style="s2">to be an objective collectively go after</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.480" end="01:22:48.719" style="s2">the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.199" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s why they all throw rocks at</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.719" end="01:22:52.800" style="s2">the same time so none of them is guilty</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:55.920" style="s2">of killing the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.800" end="01:22:58.159" style="s2">oh it just died right and it died and</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.920" end="01:23:01.120" style="s2">there was release from tension</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.159" end="01:23:02.480" style="s2">but what gets hard to do is not only the</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.120" end="01:23:03.760" style="s2">savior standing there</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.480" end="01:23:05.440" style="s2">saying that you must not kill the</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.760" end="01:23:07.120" style="s2">scapegoat because you will repeat that</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.440" end="01:23:07.679" style="s2">all over and over again next time is</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.120" end="01:23:09.440" style="s2">your turn</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.679" end="01:23:10.880" style="s2">no this is not an ethical scapegoating</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.440" end="01:23:13.440" style="s2">christian</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.880" end="01:23:15.520" style="s2">the christian savior is not only a</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.440" end="01:23:18.239" style="s2">defender of the scapegoat in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.520" end="01:23:19.360" style="s2">the christian savior says those of you</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.239" end="01:23:22.719" style="s2">who have no sin</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.360" end="01:23:23.600" style="s2">you throw the first rock that is that is</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.719" end="01:23:26.719" style="s2">the end</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.600" end="01:23:29.040" style="s2">that is de-recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.719" end="01:23:31.679" style="s2">or and sees that it&#39;s his own face or</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.040" end="01:23:31.679" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.920" end="01:23:35.199" style="s2">maher is the devil or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.520" end="01:23:53.199" style="s2">one of you guys is an echo onto your</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.120" end="01:23:53.199" style="s2">microphone right now you don&#39;t want that</p>

<p begin="01:24:09.440" end="01:24:13.199" style="s2">you you can you can think of these six</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.040" end="01:24:16.000" style="s2">realms of the realms in which you can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.199" end="01:24:16.480" style="s2">born right reincarnated but chogyam</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.000" end="01:24:18.880" style="s2">trump</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.480" end="01:24:19.600" style="s2">actually used them very much as ways of</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.880" end="01:24:21.840" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.600" end="01:24:23.199" style="s2">right so so many people who do</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.840" end="01:24:25.120" style="s2">meditation and do these</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.199" end="01:24:26.719" style="s2">follow these these uh you know new age</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:27.679" style="s2">teachings that they try to get to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.719" end="01:24:29.520" style="s2">god realm</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.679" end="01:24:30.719" style="s2">so that&#39;s the realm of perfect being</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.520" end="01:24:32.320" style="s2">right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.719" end="01:24:34.159" style="s2">where you&#39;re enlightened you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.320" end="01:24:34.800" style="s2">perfectly happy and you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.159" end="01:24:36.560" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.800" end="01:24:37.920" style="s2">so but that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s not the goal</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.560" end="01:24:39.600" style="s2">of it that&#39;s just one of these six</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.920" end="01:24:40.719" style="s2">realms and the other other realms are</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.600" end="01:24:43.360" style="s2">the hungry the</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.719" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">the jealous god real where you you this</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.360" end="01:24:46.080" style="s2">is kind of like</p>

<p begin="01:24:46.080" end="01:24:48.719" style="s2">still want to be richer that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.840" end="01:24:50.239" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.719" end="01:24:52.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the jealous god ryan then you</p>

<p begin="01:25:04.239" end="01:25:08.560" style="s2">violence and war and</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.760" end="01:25:10.480" style="s2">hatred yeah and in each of these realms</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.560" end="01:25:11.840" style="s2">so these are beings right you have god</p>

<p begin="01:25:23.920" end="01:25:28.400" style="s2">an opportunity for a buddha</p>

<p begin="01:25:36.560" end="01:25:40.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very i think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.560" end="01:25:42.960" style="s2">very nice teaching and basically</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.080" end="01:25:44.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not so much about um about avoiding</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.960" end="01:25:46.400" style="s2">these realms</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.320" end="01:25:48.400" style="s2">which would be kind of the the sutrick</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.400" end="01:25:49.440" style="s2">approach or and the approach of</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.400" end="01:25:51.920" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.440" end="01:25:53.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s about recognizing in which real</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.920" end="01:25:56.239" style="s2">realm you are and by</p>

<p begin="01:26:06.320" end="01:26:10.480" style="s2">very open</p>

<p begin="01:26:26.080" end="01:26:29.199" style="s2">prosperous so in that sense it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.000" end="01:26:32.000" style="s2">much about because</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.199" end="01:26:32.480" style="s2">you so the the buddhism is not so much</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.000" end="01:26:35.280" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.480" end="01:26:36.320" style="s2">about escaping the cycle it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.280" end="01:26:39.280" style="s2">accepting the</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.320" end="01:26:39.840" style="s2">cycle completely as your as your way of</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.280" end="01:26:42.800" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.840" end="01:26:44.960" style="s2">there is no but it&#39;s alchemical too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.800" end="01:26:48.159" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s transforming that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.960" end="01:26:49.920" style="s2">you brought up alchemy uh alexander i</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.159" end="01:26:52.239" style="s2">think that vagina path is profoundly</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.920" end="01:26:55.920" style="s2">alchemical it&#39;s about transforming</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.239" end="01:26:57.520" style="s2">those uh those realms i love it i guess</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.920" end="01:26:59.120" style="s2">this is this is great this explains a</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.520" end="01:27:00.719" style="s2">lot because</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.120" end="01:27:02.480" style="s2">although i&#39;m familiar with it the way</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.719" end="01:27:03.679" style="s2">you explain it now in this context means</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.480" end="01:27:06.800" style="s2">you create a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.679" end="01:27:08.320" style="s2">very concrete micro ethics just like</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.800" end="01:27:09.920" style="s2">these are the different answers though</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.320" end="01:27:11.840" style="s2">they also rhyme very well with all three</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.920" end="01:27:13.120" style="s2">narratives pathos logos and mythos</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.840" end="01:27:14.880" style="s2">because you have the aspects of path as</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.120" end="01:27:15.920" style="s2">long as it is so so the stories you tell</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.880" end="01:27:17.440" style="s2">about yourself that&#39;s all about the</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.920" end="01:27:18.960" style="s2">world are you pathetic or mythical</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.440" end="01:27:21.360" style="s2">logical or the mixes of them</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.960" end="01:27:22.320" style="s2">so the same thing matches these six six</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.360" end="01:27:24.560" style="s2">realms too</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.320" end="01:27:25.520" style="s2">but you actually then go into sort of</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.560" end="01:27:27.840" style="s2">microethicals</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.520" end="01:27:30.080" style="s2">you do concretely deal with these things</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.840" end="01:27:30.800" style="s2">and that transformation you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.080" end="01:27:32.719" style="s2">about here</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.800" end="01:27:34.560" style="s2">is the shift i&#39;m interested in because</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.719" end="01:27:36.159" style="s2">the transformation is the goal</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.560" end="01:27:38.320" style="s2">of why you have forgiveness is your</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.159" end="01:27:40.480" style="s2">astronaut the forgiveness of strategism</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.320" end="01:27:42.480" style="s2">is not there as a generous</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.480" end="01:27:44.400" style="s2">thing to be thrown off because you have</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.480" end="01:27:46.080" style="s2">you know your children of god and god is</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.400" end="01:27:46.560" style="s2">merciful this is not about god looking</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.080" end="01:27:48.719" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.560" end="01:27:49.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not about virtual signaling at all</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.719" end="01:27:51.600" style="s2">no it&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.840" end="01:27:53.520" style="s2">no oh you made a mistake listen you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.600" end="01:27:54.800" style="s2">got plenty of time to be child before</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.520" end="01:27:58.000" style="s2">you become a grown</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.800" end="01:27:59.280" style="s2">so why don&#39;t you try again okay you try</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.000" end="01:28:01.199" style="s2">and try again and then you finally</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.280" end="01:28:03.199" style="s2">transform and you become a grown up</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.199" end="01:28:04.560" style="s2">in zoroastrianism so you stop being a</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.199" end="01:28:06.000" style="s2">child you become a grown up and you take</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.560" end="01:28:07.120" style="s2">on the responsibilities you go through</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.000" end="01:28:08.639" style="s2">right of passage</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.120" end="01:28:10.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a similar journey you make</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.639" end="01:28:12.639" style="s2">different steps and again</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.159" end="01:28:13.199" style="s2">there is a before and after this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.639" end="01:28:14.480" style="s2">before you</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.199" end="01:28:16.000" style="s2">walk into the realm and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.480" end="01:28:17.679" style="s2">confronted with all these things you</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.000" end="01:28:18.800" style="s2">cannot avoid them and you must be there</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.679" end="01:28:21.120" style="s2">and stay there with it</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.800" end="01:28:22.400" style="s2">until you with the buddha&#39;s help or your</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.120" end="01:28:26.560" style="s2">buddha as a role model</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.400" end="01:28:28.880" style="s2">can be transformed yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.560" end="01:28:30.400" style="s2">again it it&#39;s i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.880" end="01:28:32.159" style="s2">prohibition is the right word the</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.400" end="01:28:34.239" style="s2">religion deals with here it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.159" end="01:28:36.080" style="s2">fostering us it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.239" end="01:28:38.159" style="s2">yeah this is the right channel that now</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.080" end="01:28:39.440" style="s2">get get in here in this channel and in</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.159" end="01:28:41.679" style="s2">schooling it&#39;s education</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.440" end="01:28:43.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you do this properly here</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.679" end="01:28:45.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s been done before by many</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.840" end="01:28:46.880" style="s2">instead of guessing what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.120" end="01:28:47.440" style="s2">do then you probably arrive in the right</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.880" end="01:28:50.639" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.440" end="01:28:53.840" style="s2">now compare that for example to the idea</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.639" end="01:28:55.840" style="s2">of contemporary secular sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.840" end="01:28:57.280" style="s2">which is just that oh by the way uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.840" end="01:28:59.280" style="s2">teenagers will find out for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.280" end="01:29:01.360" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.280" end="01:29:03.280" style="s2">and they&#39;ll discover it naturally if we</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.360" end="01:29:05.600" style="s2">just close down the warehouses and close</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.280" end="01:29:07.280" style="s2">down pornography let&#39;s figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.600" end="01:29:09.040" style="s2">so let&#39;s not have to educate them or</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.280" end="01:29:10.000" style="s2">teach them about any of these things</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.040" end="01:29:12.960" style="s2">mind-bogglingly</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.000" end="01:29:14.639" style="s2">idiotic it is mind-boggling idiotic</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.960" end="01:29:15.679" style="s2">exactly which means they will only go to</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.639" end="01:29:17.280" style="s2">pornography and they have nowhere else</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.679" end="01:29:18.400" style="s2">to go i thank god of these for that</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.280" end="01:29:19.600" style="s2">because if they didn&#39;t even know that</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.400" end="01:29:21.600" style="s2">what would they do to rape each other</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.600" end="01:29:22.639" style="s2">what of course they get [ __ ] up</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.600" end="01:29:24.159" style="s2">of course they have no idea what</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.639" end="01:29:26.239" style="s2">sexuality is of course they can create</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.159" end="01:29:27.280" style="s2">all kinds of weird moralities around it</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.239" end="01:29:29.280" style="s2">because they live in a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.280" end="01:29:30.800" style="s2">post-christian world where christianity</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.280" end="01:29:31.280" style="s2">is still around but not supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.800" end="01:29:33.199" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.280" end="01:29:34.719" style="s2">the pagan alternatives is basically just</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.199" end="01:29:35.280" style="s2">rape and take whatever you want and</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.719" end="01:29:37.600" style="s2">leave</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.280" end="01:29:39.280" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s well because they</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.600" end="01:29:42.000" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the out</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.280" end="01:29:42.639" style="s2">chemical aspect of sexuality right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.000" end="01:29:45.360" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.639" end="01:29:47.040" style="s2">children cannot invent a world of rules</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.360" end="01:29:50.800" style="s2">and regulations then we get</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.040" end="01:29:52.000" style="s2">lord of the flies we left sexuality in</p>

<p begin="01:30:57.199" end="01:31:01.199" style="s2">i think i think the search for mentors</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.920" end="01:31:02.239" style="s2">is a healthy thing we see among the</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.199" end="01:31:03.120" style="s2">young guys right now on the men&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:31:03.120" end="01:31:07.120" style="s2">we embrace it because there&#39;s a lack of</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.960" end="01:31:07.440" style="s2">mentors they go into alchemy and lodges</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.120" end="01:31:08.719" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.440" end="01:31:10.800" style="s2">orders and things because that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.719" end="01:31:12.239" style="s2">you meet the other guys your own age</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.800" end="01:31:13.840" style="s2">that is essentially what a really good</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.239" end="01:31:15.920" style="s2">men&#39;s group is</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.840" end="01:31:17.520" style="s2">like if you don&#39;t find elders find five</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.920" end="01:31:19.360" style="s2">other guys your own age because together</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.520" end="01:31:21.199" style="s2">you&#39;re 100 years old you have</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.360" end="01:31:22.639" style="s2">five times 20 years life experience</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.199" end="01:31:23.199" style="s2">that&#39;s not a bad start at all for a</p>

<p begin="01:31:23.199" end="01:31:26.000" style="s2">i think these reactions that are coming</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.480" end="01:31:27.040" style="s2">from the young smart kids right now are</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.000" end="01:31:28.560" style="s2">very healthy and good</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.040" end="01:31:30.000" style="s2">that means they&#39;re going necrocratic</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.560" end="01:31:31.360" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna do fine they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.000" end="01:31:32.480" style="s2">do well they&#39;re going to be engineers</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.360" end="01:31:33.840" style="s2">programmers coders</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.480" end="01:31:35.600" style="s2">they&#39;re going to create a technological</p>

<p begin="01:31:39.360" end="01:31:43.040" style="s2">process right some kind of process to go</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.600" end="01:31:45.920" style="s2">through rather than just</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.040" end="01:31:47.280" style="s2">this being through process and event</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.920" end="01:31:49.520" style="s2">thrown into the world with</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.280" end="01:31:52.000" style="s2">with nothing and just process is</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.520" end="01:31:55.440" style="s2">childhood but the move from childhood to</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.000" end="01:31:56.800" style="s2">adulthood is the event okay adulthood is</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.440" end="01:31:59.280" style="s2">a process</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.800" end="01:32:00.000" style="s2">you move from adulthood into elderhood</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.280" end="01:32:02.159" style="s2">an event</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.000" end="01:32:03.679" style="s2">oh that&#39;s another priesthood an event at</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.159" end="01:32:05.920" style="s2">the priesthood for the divine</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.679" end="01:32:07.679" style="s2">okay so these steps the part absolutes</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.920" end="01:32:10.400" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to go through say you go</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.679" end="01:32:12.800" style="s2">you within sutra you&#39;re in process yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.400" end="01:32:13.360" style="s2">you go from sutra to tantra that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.800" end="01:32:15.280" style="s2">event</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.360" end="01:32:16.880" style="s2">then you can move into tantra as a</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.280" end="01:32:18.800" style="s2">process this is why we write a book</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.880" end="01:32:20.560" style="s2">called prasan event is to discuss</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.800" end="01:32:22.080" style="s2">and understand how you can be in a loop</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.560" end="01:32:24.159" style="s2">where you can make mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.080" end="01:32:26.000" style="s2">you can make them all over again and you</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.159" end="01:32:28.000" style="s2">you learn from your mistakes and you get</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.000" end="01:32:29.600" style="s2">ready and eventually whoop one day the</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.000" end="01:32:30.000" style="s2">event happens and you can pass on to the</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.600" end="01:32:31.520" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.000" end="01:32:33.679" style="s2">well that&#39;s it&#39;s not that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.520" end="01:32:34.320" style="s2">perfected sutra in some kind of a way</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.679" end="01:32:35.920" style="s2">right you</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.320" end="01:32:37.360" style="s2">to get to the event that you would go</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.920" end="01:32:38.960" style="s2">into tantra like you don&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.360" end="01:32:42.000" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.960" end="01:32:42.880" style="s2">oh you you become whole you you well you</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.000" end="01:32:44.880" style="s2">don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.880" end="01:32:48.080" style="s2">become whole if there&#39;s there&#39;s an event</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.880" end="01:32:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.080" end="01:32:51.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no perfection there&#39;s no no no</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.320" end="01:32:54.560" style="s2">there&#39;s no perfection there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.920" end="01:32:57.360" style="s2">there&#39;s just it&#39;s not perfect completion</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.560" end="01:32:59.440" style="s2">and perfection are different words</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.360" end="01:33:00.880" style="s2">completion means you completed that</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.440" end="01:33:01.199" style="s2">journey it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re perfect</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.880" end="01:33:02.960" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.199" end="01:33:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just that what you were supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.960" end="01:33:05.280" style="s2">do there you&#39;ve done it you&#39;re through</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.800" end="01:33:07.280" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.280" end="01:33:09.120" style="s2">you can move on to the next stage so</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.280" end="01:33:10.560" style="s2">completion is not perfection remember</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.120" end="01:33:13.600" style="s2">that in smarasian religion there is</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.560" end="01:33:15.600" style="s2">completion there is no perfection</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.600" end="01:33:17.679" style="s2">but we are in a we are in a very good</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.600" end="01:33:18.400" style="s2">position and we are in a very good</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.679" end="01:33:21.360" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.400" end="01:33:23.280" style="s2">because we have uh we have we have the</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.360" end="01:33:24.560" style="s2">we have a deep theoretical framework to</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.280" end="01:33:26.080" style="s2">understand tantra and</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.560" end="01:33:28.639" style="s2">to understand sutra because we have</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.080" end="01:33:30.320" style="s2">girard for sutra with very precise</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.639" end="01:33:32.320" style="s2">description of desire</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.320" end="01:33:33.760" style="s2">and then we have we have uh nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.320" end="01:33:35.600" style="s2">who has the tantric side</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.760" end="01:33:38.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re they need to be united you</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.600" end="01:33:40.560" style="s2">know like girard didn&#39;t quite uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.400" end="01:33:41.760" style="s2">do nietzsche justice and of course</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.560" end="01:33:43.440" style="s2">nietzsche was way too</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.760" end="01:33:45.199" style="s2">i mean he just jumped into tantra and</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.440" end="01:33:46.880" style="s2">rejected sutra completely</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.199" end="01:33:48.480" style="s2">so in a sense we have like two</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.880" end="01:33:50.400" style="s2">incomplete geniuses</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.480" end="01:33:51.520" style="s2">and they need to be united so i guess</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.400" end="01:33:52.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to do in your</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.520" end="01:33:53.840" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.159" end="01:33:54.880" style="s2">on a better yeah and we got hagel and</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.840" end="01:33:55.679" style="s2">white on the other side for the</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.880" end="01:33:58.639" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.679" end="01:34:00.560" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah well those four are the</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.639" end="01:34:02.639" style="s2">giant those four are the giants i agree</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.560" end="01:34:04.239" style="s2">completely i&#39;m willing to skip the less</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.639" end="01:34:05.840" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.239" end="01:34:07.840" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t fulfill the</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.840" end="01:34:08.639" style="s2">requirements there&#39;s something lacking</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.840" end="01:34:10.000" style="s2">in him he was a</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.639" end="01:34:11.840" style="s2">brilliant when he was younger but he</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.000" end="01:34:14.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.840" end="01:34:15.280" style="s2">the last just basically took made a</p>

<p begin="01:34:25.120" end="01:34:29.040" style="s2">that&#39;s the last book on each is</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.960" end="01:34:31.840" style="s2">fantastic but it&#39;s a book on nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.040" end="01:34:33.360" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s great so you&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.840" end="01:34:34.639" style="s2">nietzsche through heidi and the laws and</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.360" end="01:34:37.120" style="s2">started them in parallel</p>

<p begin="01:39:26.320" end="01:39:29.520" style="s2">finally makes the right move against the</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.320" end="01:39:31.199" style="s2">lures by saying that</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.520" end="01:39:32.639" style="s2">somebody said this would be the lesson</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.199" end="01:39:34.639" style="s2">century i think actually for</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.639" end="01:39:34.960" style="s2">co-prophesied to said that in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.639" end="01:39:36.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.960" end="01:39:38.320" style="s2">the future is the lesson h and then his</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.880" end="01:39:39.840" style="s2">challenge just i said no</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.320" end="01:39:42.239" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m adamant it&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.840" end="01:39:43.440" style="s2">hegelian h and finally they get an age</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.239" end="01:39:45.119" style="s2">is going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.440" end="01:39:46.800" style="s2">and and he then takes hegel into</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.119" end="01:39:48.400" style="s2">neuroscience and everything and you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.800" end="01:39:50.239" style="s2">the first three pages of that book</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.400" end="01:39:52.239" style="s2">contained more knowledge and more</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.239" end="01:39:55.440" style="s2">original insight than the entire</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.239" end="01:39:57.040" style="s2">uber of shisha last 10 years so the guy</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.440" end="01:39:58.239" style="s2">has both written a crappy book i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.040" end="01:39:59.199" style="s2">know who put that together the</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.239" end="01:40:00.880" style="s2">publishing company</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.199" end="01:40:02.560" style="s2">and then obviously it&#39;s worked properly</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.880" end="01:40:04.480" style="s2">on the other one which is where he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.560" end="01:40:06.159" style="s2">his heart</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.480" end="01:40:07.920" style="s2">and and i think adrian johnstone</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.159" end="01:40:09.119" style="s2">slavishing because they&#39;re now fighting</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.920" end="01:40:10.639" style="s2">over hegel which is the right</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.119" end="01:40:12.000" style="s2">interpretation of echo we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.639" end="01:40:13.840" style="s2">very close to each other but</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.000" end="01:40:15.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a transcendental materialism</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.840" end="01:40:16.960" style="s2">which is johnston they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.040" end="01:40:18.719" style="s2">dialectical materialism which is</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.960" end="01:40:20.159" style="s2">which is uh and we&#39;re going to kill</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.719" end="01:40:20.960" style="s2">materialism all together with brady</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.159" end="01:40:22.880" style="s2">island&#39;s help</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.960" end="01:40:24.480" style="s2">and create a transcendental emergencism</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.880" end="01:40:26.320" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.480" end="01:40:28.320" style="s2">which i think is more hegelian there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.320" end="01:40:30.639" style="s2">more spinosa and hegel than these guys</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.320" end="01:40:30.639" style="s2">admit</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.679" end="01:40:36.880" style="s2">what was that about spinoza oh</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.719" end="01:40:39.440" style="s2">hegel is the coalition of kant versus</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.880" end="01:40:39.440" style="s2">spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.719" end="01:40:47.520" style="s2">so the spanish universe ends up flat</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.239" end="01:40:47.920" style="s2">and no freedom no motivation no pathos</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.520" end="01:40:49.360" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.920" end="01:40:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a very dead place</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.360" end="01:40:53.600" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s so feminine it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.280" end="01:40:54.960" style="s2">yeah the virtue signalers today are all</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.600" end="01:40:56.639" style="s2">kind of vulgar spinners</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.960" end="01:40:58.560" style="s2">every one of them is a vulgar species</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.639" end="01:40:59.840" style="s2">today it&#39;s just like yeah ecology is</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.560" end="01:41:02.000" style="s2">vulgar spinacism</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.840" end="01:41:03.280" style="s2">everything is oneness vulgar he said</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.000" end="01:41:04.800" style="s2">vulgar spin doesn&#39;t make new age</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.280" end="01:41:06.320" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s vulgar spinosa</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.800" end="01:41:08.159" style="s2">the way hegel reacted is that this is</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.320" end="01:41:09.679" style="s2">just dead philosophy just fly it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.159" end="01:41:12.159" style="s2">easy that&#39;s not how things work</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.679" end="01:41:14.159" style="s2">and then kant comes along and kant says</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.159" end="01:41:15.920" style="s2">that phenomenological the nominal cannot</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.159" end="01:41:17.840" style="s2">meet and they&#39;re separated meaning</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.920" end="01:41:20.480" style="s2">there is a separation in the world that</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.840" end="01:41:22.960" style="s2">spinoza hasn&#39;t acknowledged</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.480" end="01:41:23.679" style="s2">okay there&#39;s a problem after count with</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.960" end="01:41:25.840" style="s2">spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.679" end="01:41:26.960" style="s2">the copernican internal count makes me</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.840" end="01:41:27.679" style="s2">says there&#39;s a massive problem with</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.960" end="01:41:29.760" style="s2">spinosa</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.679" end="01:41:31.840" style="s2">you either go back to prior to count and</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.760" end="01:41:32.159" style="s2">you dig into that and you dwell in that</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.840" end="01:41:35.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.159" end="01:41:36.159" style="s2">the lures tried to do and failed or you</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.119" end="01:41:37.600" style="s2">actually do what happened</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.159" end="01:41:39.280" style="s2">and said that what if we haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.600" end="01:41:42.560" style="s2">thought kant all the way through</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.280" end="01:41:44.080" style="s2">properly and arrived at a monism that is</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.560" end="01:41:46.400" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.080" end="01:41:47.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not a dead space it&#39;s process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.400" end="01:41:50.000" style="s2">thriving and it&#39;s alive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.840" end="01:41:51.840" style="s2">dialectical it&#39;s moving all the time</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.000" end="01:41:53.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what hegel does when he moves</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.840" end="01:41:56.239" style="s2">into transcendental idealism</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.920" end="01:41:57.199" style="s2">but it moves away from the controversial</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.239" end="01:42:00.159" style="s2">by saying that no</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.199" end="01:42:01.679" style="s2">actually the nominal is completely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.159" end="01:42:03.679" style="s2">not even interesting</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.679" end="01:42:05.280" style="s2">just get rid of the numeral altogether</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.679" end="01:42:08.159" style="s2">we obviously collide with</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.280" end="01:42:10.480" style="s2">rocks all the time it&#39;s it&#39;s a given but</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.159" end="01:42:12.400" style="s2">we live in a world of phenomena and the</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.480" end="01:42:13.600" style="s2">phenomenology of spirit essentially how</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.400" end="01:42:15.440" style="s2">the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.600" end="01:42:16.960" style="s2">how does human spirit deal with the</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.440" end="01:42:18.880" style="s2">phenomenology we&#39;re approaching</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.960" end="01:42:20.159" style="s2">oh it has done that in different ways</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.880" end="01:42:23.280" style="s2">throughout history hey</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.159" end="01:42:25.920" style="s2">paradigms hey historicism hey</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.280" end="01:42:28.480" style="s2">historicity and you know and i&#39;m totally</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.920" end="01:42:29.760" style="s2">with hegel and all these things</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.480" end="01:42:32.239" style="s2">we work we&#39;re living in a very</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.760" end="01:42:34.400" style="s2">historical world with events</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.239" end="01:42:35.360" style="s2">and these events change history forever</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.400" end="01:42:38.800" style="s2">and the question</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.360" end="01:42:41.520" style="s2">now as always is will the anuject rise</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.800" end="01:42:42.480" style="s2">in create tyrant with tarot or can we</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.520" end="01:42:44.480" style="s2">avoid that</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.480" end="01:42:45.760" style="s2">with still learning the lesson we should</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.480" end="01:42:47.360" style="s2">learn from lynch mobs</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.760" end="01:42:49.600" style="s2">learn the lesson let them kill each</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.360" end="01:42:53.040" style="s2">other for god&#39;s sake and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.600" end="01:42:54.480" style="s2">see the higher project rise which is the</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.040" end="01:42:55.199" style="s2">force for constructive change of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.480" end="01:42:57.679" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.199" end="01:42:58.639" style="s2">our project high project at the same</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.679" end="01:43:00.159" style="s2">high project okay</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.639" end="01:43:01.760" style="s2">high project we agreed on the high</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.159" end="01:43:03.280" style="s2">projector last time it&#39;s a good term</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.760" end="01:43:05.440" style="s2">because super deck and whitehead is</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.280" end="01:43:07.119" style="s2">different although they&#39;re related</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.440" end="01:43:08.800" style="s2">because the white head and super deck is</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.119" end="01:43:10.800" style="s2">really the beginning of the high project</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.800" end="01:43:12.400" style="s2">but the higher projected super data goes</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.800" end="01:43:14.719" style="s2">out and acts in the world and does the</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.400" end="01:43:16.239" style="s2">right things which is of course</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.719" end="01:43:18.239" style="s2">stopping the lynch mode that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.239" end="01:43:20.480" style="s2">thing you do then</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.239" end="01:43:22.159" style="s2">providing forgiveness so you can try</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.480" end="01:43:24.159" style="s2">again second thing you do</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.159" end="01:43:26.080" style="s2">you can then add to that list or what</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.159" end="01:43:27.679" style="s2">the high projective force does</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.080" end="01:43:29.920" style="s2">to create a better more constructive</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.679" end="01:43:29.920" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.080" end="01:43:38.239" style="s2">then i think we&#39;re on the right path</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.119" end="01:43:39.920" style="s2">so uh yeah i i agree i&#39;m with them i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.239" end="01:43:40.719" style="s2">with them that i loved spinoza when i</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.920" end="01:43:42.320" style="s2">was younger</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.719" end="01:43:44.000" style="s2">i struggled with kant it was a bit</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.320" end="01:43:45.920" style="s2">boring but i realized there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.000" end="01:43:47.600" style="s2">movement to spinoza&#39;s philosophy yes the</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.920" end="01:43:48.239" style="s2">same problem that i found with taoism in</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.600" end="01:43:50.000" style="s2">china</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.239" end="01:43:51.360" style="s2">you said you got yin and yang he said</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.000" end="01:43:52.560" style="s2">but it has to be third force and people</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.360" end="01:43:53.679" style="s2">tell you well it&#39;s the border between</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.560" end="01:43:56.400" style="s2">you near</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.679" end="01:43:58.480" style="s2">uh that&#39;s just a border this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.400" end="01:44:00.400" style="s2">really happening there it&#39;s not a force</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.480" end="01:44:01.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t put the thing on the move it</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.400" end="01:44:02.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make it move it&#39;s not a problem</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.920" end="01:44:04.840" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.239" end="01:44:06.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t explain what you need to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.840" end="01:44:08.320" style="s2">processed</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.560" end="01:44:10.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s what taoism lacks and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.320" end="01:44:11.440" style="s2">why it opens up the door there must be</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.000" end="01:44:12.800" style="s2">something else in china&#39;s culture you</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.440" end="01:44:16.719" style="s2">can&#39;t just say with daoism</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.800" end="01:44:16.719" style="s2">because it becomes banal</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.199" end="01:44:21.840" style="s2">it has to be third force involved and</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.040" end="01:44:24.560" style="s2">that is the hegelian dialectics</p>

<p begin="01:44:24.560" end="01:44:29.119" style="s2">abstraction leads to concretion</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.639" end="01:44:29.760" style="s2">the concretion then becomes the negation</p>

<p begin="01:44:40.639" end="01:44:43.920" style="s2">is it that it&#39;s not concrete enough for</p>

<p begin="01:44:43.920" end="01:44:47.360" style="s2">that kickstarts the next negation makes</p>

<p begin="01:44:49.520" end="01:44:52.800" style="s2">this is even valid for physics i think</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.119" end="01:44:53.440" style="s2">he&#39;s a very risky territory when he says</p>

<p begin="01:44:53.440" end="01:44:57.280" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s certainly valid for</p>

<p begin="01:44:57.280" end="01:45:00.840" style="s2">and i&#39;m perfectly happy with that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.199" end="01:45:03.840" style="s2">the only emergence factor where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.840" end="01:45:03.840" style="s2">needed</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.440" end="01:45:09.280" style="s2">i have no idea but it sounds like it</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.400" end="01:45:12.400" style="s2">sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.280" end="01:45:13.760" style="s2">buddhism a bit to me that sounds very</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.400" end="01:45:16.239" style="s2">vague</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.760" end="01:45:18.239" style="s2">oh it sounds big to thomas once you look</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.239" end="01:45:20.719" style="s2">into it that&#39;s how you become breathing</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.239" end="01:45:22.080" style="s2">always sounds very vague to me like well</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.719" end="01:45:23.920" style="s2">what does this actually mean that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.080" end="01:45:25.520" style="s2">i like whitehead you know it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.920" end="01:45:27.600" style="s2">complicated but you know you can really</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.520" end="01:45:30.480" style="s2">dig into the hair is kind of a bit</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.600" end="01:45:31.440" style="s2">but it might it&#39;s me i mean i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.480" end="01:45:33.520" style="s2">studied hegel</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.440" end="01:45:35.119" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m kind of i would say if you</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.520" end="01:45:35.920" style="s2">don&#39;t the other way you would say the</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.119" end="01:45:38.320" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.920" end="01:45:40.239" style="s2">so hegel and whitehead are on a par i</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.320" end="01:45:40.800" style="s2">said you do the metaphysics with the two</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.239" end="01:45:43.600" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.800" end="01:45:45.760" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s still where white it</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.600" end="01:45:47.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t accomplished this amazing project</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.760" end="01:45:49.199" style="s2">you can still use hegel to think it</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.360" end="01:45:50.639" style="s2">through properly why said he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.199" end="01:45:52.719" style="s2">incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.639" end="01:45:54.320" style="s2">of course he&#39;s incredibly again no we</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.719" end="01:45:55.679" style="s2">discussed that it&#39;s true bradley right</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.320" end="01:45:58.880" style="s2">so so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.679" end="01:45:59.280" style="s2">i&#39;m sure that uh i mean i&#39;m very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.880" end="01:46:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.280" end="01:46:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s i&#39;ll put it on my to-do list again</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.280" end="01:46:05.600" style="s2">you know like and not the bad hegel that</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.360" end="01:46:07.119" style="s2">the french read after the 1940s because</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.600" end="01:46:08.800" style="s2">they misunderstood it completely when</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.119" end="01:46:10.480" style="s2">the loss attacks hillary hasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.800" end="01:46:11.760" style="s2">studied higgled properly doesn&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.480" end="01:46:12.639" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what ends up in the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.760" end="01:46:14.080" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.639" end="01:46:15.760" style="s2">and i think this is the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.080" end="01:46:17.679" style="s2">contemporary spinal system</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.760" end="01:46:18.880" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t start hegel carefully</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.679" end="01:46:19.840" style="s2">enough to understand that hegel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.880" end="01:46:22.960" style="s2">critique</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.840" end="01:46:24.960" style="s2">higgen loved spinosa he called spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.960" end="01:46:28.000" style="s2">the messiah philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.960" end="01:46:29.600" style="s2">but he then looked at what spinoza was</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.000" end="01:46:31.520" style="s2">missing and that&#39;s when he started</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.600" end="01:46:34.159" style="s2">moving and that&#39;s what that is why</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.520" end="01:46:35.360" style="s2">western process philosophy starts and</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.159" end="01:46:38.719" style="s2">ends with hegel</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.360" end="01:46:38.719" style="s2">and it includes whitehead</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.199" end="01:46:42.880" style="s2">processing event these are the guys we</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.000" end="01:46:44.239" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.880" end="01:46:46.000" style="s2">we can work on these four guys and then</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.239" end="01:46:47.520" style="s2">we can go back and study and restart the</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.000" end="01:46:49.840" style="s2">east again and again again</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.520" end="01:46:51.440" style="s2">probably find similar patterns way older</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.840" end="01:46:54.800" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.440" end="01:46:57.520" style="s2">so here you go whitehead gerard yes</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.800" end="01:46:58.000" style="s2">all right i&#39;m on board well tell our</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.520" end="01:46:59.600" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.000" end="01:47:01.440" style="s2">you got to get these guys eventually</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.600" end="01:47:04.159" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be hard you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.440" end="01:47:05.600" style="s2">long journey uh maybe don&#39;t jump into</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.159" end="01:47:06.400" style="s2">hegel&#39;s signs of logic the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.600" end="01:47:09.679" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.400" end="01:47:10.719" style="s2">uh because that&#39;s like an incredible</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.679" end="01:47:12.800" style="s2">challenge right</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.719" end="01:47:14.560" style="s2">but once you do and you get it you</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.800" end="01:47:16.159" style="s2">understand how he thinks and he really</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.560" end="01:47:17.600" style="s2">thinks he&#39;s completely misunderstood</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.159" end="01:47:18.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s very drought but then you</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.600" end="01:47:20.480" style="s2">get it so that white it</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.880" end="01:47:22.000" style="s2">once you to begin with get the</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.480" end="01:47:23.600" style="s2">vocabulary just</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.000" end="01:47:25.040" style="s2">don&#39;t think you understand the words by</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.600" end="01:47:26.639" style="s2">themselves because they use these</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.040" end="01:47:28.159" style="s2">words that you&#39;ve heard before in a</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.639" end="01:47:30.159" style="s2">completely different way than what you</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.159" end="01:47:31.920" style="s2">thought they would</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.159" end="01:47:33.440" style="s2">you have to read learn language itself</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.920" end="01:47:35.679" style="s2">to study these masters</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.440" end="01:47:37.440" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s always deep thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.679" end="01:47:40.000" style="s2">always need to redefine</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.440" end="01:47:41.920" style="s2">part at least parts of language because</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.000" end="01:47:43.440" style="s2">i think nietzsche richard why is it in</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.920" end="01:47:44.239" style="s2">that way but hegel and white because</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.440" end="01:47:46.000" style="s2">they&#39;re moving to the world of</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.239" end="01:47:47.440" style="s2">metaphysics which is incredibly complex</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.000" end="01:47:48.400" style="s2">metaphysics of phenomenology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.440" end="01:47:50.560" style="s2">where they&#39;re located</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.400" end="01:47:51.440" style="s2">whereas with nietzsche and and girard</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.560" end="01:47:54.239" style="s2">we&#39;re in the social</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.440" end="01:47:55.920" style="s2">philosophy of the social this is social</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.239" end="01:47:57.360" style="s2">flow this is understanding ourselves our</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.920" end="01:47:59.440" style="s2">own predicaments who we are</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.360" end="01:48:00.960" style="s2">and where we&#39;re at in society today it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.440" end="01:48:02.639" style="s2">existentialism that&#39;s why they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.960" end="01:48:04.000" style="s2">need to invent a whole new vocabulary</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.639" end="01:48:04.719" style="s2">because it&#39;s already there whereas the</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.000" end="01:48:07.199" style="s2">other guys do</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.719" end="01:48:08.080" style="s2">so is that what you&#39;re saying come again</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.199" end="01:48:11.600" style="s2">andrew i didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.080" end="01:48:14.480" style="s2">oh nichi and and um</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.600" end="01:48:15.760" style="s2">and girard use the english language</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.480" end="01:48:17.280" style="s2">right as we know it right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.760" end="01:48:18.800" style="s2">readable you know kind of readable</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.280" end="01:48:21.119" style="s2">my nietzsche wrote so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.800" end="01:48:23.920" style="s2">inventing a whole new vocabulary to</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.119" end="01:48:26.320" style="s2">describe a whole new territory which</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.920" end="01:48:29.600" style="s2">these other guys need to do somehow</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.320" end="01:48:30.000" style="s2">well i&#39;m always very very uh suspicious</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.600" end="01:48:33.360" style="s2">when i</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.000" end="01:48:34.400" style="s2">encounter um jargon and very complicated</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.360" end="01:48:36.480" style="s2">texts</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.400" end="01:48:38.159" style="s2">um you should be because in 99 percent</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.480" end="01:48:40.239" style="s2">of the cases [ __ ] but one percent of</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.159" end="01:48:41.920" style="s2">the cases most brilliant takes ever read</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.239" end="01:48:43.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why i i mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.920" end="01:48:44.880" style="s2">taking ketamine nine</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.280" end="01:48:46.560" style="s2">nine ideas out of ten you get on</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.880" end="01:48:47.840" style="s2">ketamine or rubbish but the 10th idea is</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.560" end="01:48:48.560" style="s2">probably brilliant enough to be looked</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.840" end="01:48:50.159" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.560" end="01:48:52.320" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s just it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.159" end="01:48:53.920" style="s2">of those things yeah but just because of</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.320" end="01:48:55.600" style="s2">almost all of it is [ __ ] it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.920" end="01:48:56.239" style="s2">there&#39;s gold in there but there is gold</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.600" end="01:48:58.880" style="s2">in there and</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.239" end="01:49:00.400" style="s2">actually when you get it you get it from</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.880" end="01:49:02.239" style="s2">white when you get it just like</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.400" end="01:49:04.080" style="s2">yeah could you have done it any other</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.239" end="01:49:05.679" style="s2">way probably not</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.080" end="01:49:06.960" style="s2">because you as a philosopher you sit</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.679" end="01:49:08.719" style="s2">there all the time are you going to</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.960" end="01:49:09.760" style="s2">invent new terms like an object and</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.719" end="01:49:12.000" style="s2">higher project</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.760" end="01:49:13.119" style="s2">yes we have to because we sat and have</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.000" end="01:49:15.520" style="s2">these conversations</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.119" end="01:49:16.560" style="s2">wonderful conversations with you and we</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.520" end="01:49:18.880" style="s2">realized that</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.560" end="01:49:20.719" style="s2">this voice coming from inside the</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.880" end="01:49:24.239" style="s2">lunchbox doesn&#39;t really have a name</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.719" end="01:49:27.760" style="s2">in a western language and objects</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.239" end="01:49:29.599" style="s2">like in abject subject would make sense</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.760" end="01:49:33.280" style="s2">anno meaning anonymous here</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.599" end="01:49:35.199" style="s2">is like oh it&#39;s the voice that nobody</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.280" end="01:49:36.719" style="s2">subscribes it nobody says they&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.199" end="01:49:38.239" style="s2">voice but they all</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.719" end="01:49:39.920" style="s2">claim the part of the voice and they</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.239" end="01:49:41.040" style="s2">blame their own shortcomings on that</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.920" end="01:49:42.800" style="s2">voice so this is</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.040" end="01:49:44.880" style="s2">frick little voice that just with the</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.800" end="01:49:45.599" style="s2">costume on it and you know it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.880" end="01:49:46.960" style="s2">the tyrant</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.599" end="01:49:48.800" style="s2">and when you realize that then you can</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.960" end="01:49:50.639" style="s2">just go what&#39;s the inversion of that oh</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.800" end="01:49:51.599" style="s2">god of course that&#39;s the savior figure</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.639" end="01:49:53.440" style="s2">like the social</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.599" end="01:49:55.920" style="s2">he who stands up to the lynch mob and</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.440" end="01:49:56.960" style="s2">stops it or even goes to the cross in</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.920" end="01:49:59.599" style="s2">case that&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.960" end="01:50:00.480" style="s2">okay that&#39;s essential the messiah who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.599" end="01:50:04.800" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.480" end="01:50:07.440" style="s2">project so it&#39;s the very best in us</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.800" end="01:50:09.360" style="s2">the most courageous in us the most truth</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.440" end="01:50:11.679" style="s2">seeking in us the most heroic and all</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.360" end="01:50:13.760" style="s2">that the best we can possibly be</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.679" end="01:50:15.040" style="s2">the optimization of our own selves</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.760" end="01:50:16.880" style="s2">ethically speaking</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.040" end="01:50:18.719" style="s2">if we use with some luck and with some</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.880" end="01:50:21.360" style="s2">hard work can get to that point</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.719" end="01:50:23.119" style="s2">we have hyper objected ourselves we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.360" end="01:50:26.400" style="s2">gone from super deck to high project</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.119" end="01:50:28.000" style="s2">and the high project can both be role</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.400" end="01:50:29.760" style="s2">model and it can be the same</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.000" end="01:50:31.679" style="s2">oh that&#39;s interesting it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.760" end="01:50:35.199" style="s2">the archetype but</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.679" end="01:50:37.840" style="s2">but something new the ultimate hero</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.199" end="01:50:39.760" style="s2">but that&#39;s the niche in overman yes and</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.840" end="01:50:42.239" style="s2">that stands up against the hurt</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.760" end="01:50:44.320" style="s2">and that goes beyond the hurt thinking</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.239" end="01:50:46.159" style="s2">yes and that&#39;s what we agreed last time</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.320" end="01:50:48.239" style="s2">that the sausage and disruptionism the</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.159" end="01:50:49.520" style="s2">moshiach in judaism the savior and</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.239" end="01:50:51.199" style="s2">christianity and the over many</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.520" end="01:50:53.040" style="s2">nietzsche actually are the same figure</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.199" end="01:50:54.639" style="s2">and it says that this is the guy stands</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.040" end="01:50:56.719" style="s2">up to the mediocrity</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.639" end="01:50:58.080" style="s2">of the lynch mob the banality of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.719" end="01:51:01.920" style="s2">lynch mob and say</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.080" end="01:51:03.440" style="s2">humans can do better at least i can do</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.920" end="01:51:04.880" style="s2">better and i will show you how you do</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.440" end="01:51:06.000" style="s2">better and if you only mimic me it would</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.880" end="01:51:08.000" style="s2">be better than this [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.000" end="01:51:09.280" style="s2">trash i got in front of me you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.000" end="01:51:09.840" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially what the over man</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.280" end="01:51:13.440" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.840" end="01:51:15.280" style="s2">right it was even mark&#39;s dream of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.440" end="01:51:17.199" style="s2">proletariat and if you got to save</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.280" end="01:51:18.960" style="s2">anything in marx and i think we should</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.199" end="01:51:20.320" style="s2">we should re-read him correctly this</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.960" end="01:51:22.880" style="s2">time and and</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.320" end="01:51:23.840" style="s2">it helps we can throw marks at the wall</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.880" end="01:51:25.760" style="s2">the proletariat</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.840" end="01:51:26.960" style="s2">they hate they woke people hate parks</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.760" end="01:51:27.360" style="s2">because they never read him and do no</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.960" end="01:51:28.880" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.360" end="01:51:30.560" style="s2">because he was a rock but he would hate</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.880" end="01:51:33.520" style="s2">the walk people he would have hated him</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.560" end="01:51:35.119" style="s2">uh but but with marx is the proletariat</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.520" end="01:51:36.080" style="s2">and the proletariat is he loves the</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.119" end="01:51:37.520" style="s2">capitalists and said</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.080" end="01:51:38.960" style="s2">we could probably do better than that</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.520" end="01:51:40.560" style="s2">this would not be the end of history</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.960" end="01:51:41.199" style="s2">like we do for example with synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.560" end="01:51:43.119" style="s2">and we say</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.199" end="01:51:44.960" style="s2">why would atheism be the last of all of</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.119" end="01:51:46.080" style="s2">this it&#39;s probably just a little blip in</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.960" end="01:51:49.360" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.080" end="01:51:52.639" style="s2">it&#39;s not even properly thought through</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.360" end="01:51:54.400" style="s2">it oh okay we take god from the past and</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.639" end="01:51:55.840" style="s2">say it&#39;s not a creator god who&#39;s bored</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.400" end="01:51:57.119" style="s2">on the cloud we just put god in the</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.840" end="01:51:58.639" style="s2">future today what do you say now and</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.119" end="01:52:00.800" style="s2">they says go oops you&#39;re not allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.639" end="01:52:02.320" style="s2">do that and we say why not</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.800" end="01:52:04.400" style="s2">and then we exposed them they hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.320" end="01:52:06.080" style="s2">even thought of it they hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.400" end="01:52:07.040" style="s2">of the hegelian negation again they</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.080" end="01:52:09.760" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought it</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.040" end="01:52:10.400" style="s2">you could just take the god word and</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.760" end="01:52:12.239" style="s2">think of it</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.400" end="01:52:13.920" style="s2">what is it all about and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.239" end="01:52:17.119" style="s2">can credit put it somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.920" end="01:52:18.719" style="s2">if it does not exist yet</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.119" end="01:52:21.679" style="s2">throw it into the future what happens oh</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.719" end="01:52:30.239" style="s2">my god religion is back</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.679" end="01:52:32.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a typical hegelian term see if we</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.239" end="01:52:33.679" style="s2">could do that whitehead</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.400" end="01:52:35.679" style="s2">i&#39;m going to talk to brady ellen</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.679" end="01:52:38.080" style="s2">tomorrow our genius our co-opening</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.679" end="01:52:38.080" style="s2">genius</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.119" end="01:52:43.280" style="s2">yeah how much is it my shared adoption</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.199" end="01:52:45.119" style="s2">yeah uh i&#39;m very much looking forward to</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.280" end="01:52:46.639" style="s2">your podcast</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.119" end="01:52:48.159" style="s2">yes yes yes and please do write it</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.639" end="01:52:50.000" style="s2">without us we want to hear to you talk</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.159" end="01:52:52.880" style="s2">about why didn&#39;t put in the parallax</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.000" end="01:52:53.920" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re gonna do it on this book</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.880" end="01:52:56.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.920" end="01:52:58.000" style="s2">i want to understand uh whiteheads</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.320" end="01:52:59.599" style="s2">metaphysics from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.000" end="01:53:02.000" style="s2">quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.599" end="01:53:04.080" style="s2">brilliant because then you can be very</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.000" end="01:53:06.560" style="s2">precise what are eternal objects what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.080" end="01:53:07.920" style="s2">concretia and what is the superject and</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.560" end="01:53:09.920" style="s2">and because whitehead wrote his</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.920" end="01:53:10.960" style="s2">metaphysics such that it&#39;s compatible</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.920" end="01:53:13.440" style="s2">with both</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.960" end="01:53:14.159" style="s2">relativity theory and quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.440" end="01:53:16.719" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.159" end="01:53:17.280" style="s2">and so rather than just reading his</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.719" end="01:53:20.560" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.280" end="01:53:22.639" style="s2">so this book is basically about about</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.560" end="01:53:24.000" style="s2">how quantum mechanics fits into a white</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.639" end="01:53:26.320" style="s2">hedian framework</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.000" end="01:53:27.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s not deepak chopra right it</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.320" end="01:53:29.520" style="s2">is uh it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.520" end="01:53:31.199" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty solid so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.520" end="01:53:32.800" style="s2">going to make the the metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.199" end="01:53:35.199" style="s2">whitehead extremely precise</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.800" end="01:53:36.880" style="s2">up to uh up to mathematical detail so</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.199" end="01:53:38.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.880" end="01:53:40.159" style="s2">fantastic and by the way we should add</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.880" end="01:53:41.679" style="s2">that without watching there wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.159" end="01:53:43.280" style="s2">quantum mechanics the way we understand</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.679" end="01:53:44.239" style="s2">it max bohr wouldn&#39;t have thought the</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.280" end="01:53:46.080" style="s2">way he did</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.239" end="01:53:47.840" style="s2">whiter was ahead of them he wrote about</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.080" end="01:53:50.080" style="s2">this in 1925.</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.840" end="01:53:50.960" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know how how much he wrote</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.080" end="01:53:53.599" style="s2">definitely about</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.960" end="01:53:54.159" style="s2">uh relativity theory he had his own</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.599" end="01:53:57.599" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.159" end="01:53:59.760" style="s2">um and uh but i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.599" end="01:54:00.960" style="s2">how much influence he had on physics</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.760" end="01:54:02.159" style="s2">white hat i mean he was</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.960" end="01:54:03.920" style="s2">definitely very important for</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.159" end="01:54:05.199" style="s2">mathematics right i think that book</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.920" end="01:54:06.880" style="s2">should solve that issue because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.199" end="01:54:08.320" style="s2">also historical books so it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.880" end="01:54:11.440" style="s2">deals with black it&#39;s relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.320" end="01:54:13.040" style="s2">the quantum mechanics quantum physicist</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.440" end="01:54:15.119" style="s2">there are the the the thesis of the</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.040" end="01:54:15.920" style="s2">1920s and white were obviously burton</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.119" end="01:54:17.599" style="s2">russell and</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.920" end="01:54:18.960" style="s2">and white was one of the worst leading</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.599" end="01:54:20.480" style="s2">mathematicians i mean priscilla</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.960" end="01:54:23.199" style="s2">mathematica made him</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.480" end="01:54:24.560" style="s2">a massive academic figure in america so</p>
