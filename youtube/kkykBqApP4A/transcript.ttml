<p begin="00:00:48.150" end="00:00:53.790" style="s2">but Corbin is making use of this term in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.560" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">a new way he makes a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.790" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">the imaginary which is how we typically</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">use the word the imagination and mental</p>

<p begin="00:01:02.940" end="00:01:11.070" style="s2">and the imaginal the imaginal which</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.689" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">mediates between the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.070" end="00:01:18.539" style="s2">intelligible world and the concrete</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">sensible world and trans Jet&#39;s between</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.539" end="00:01:21.959" style="s2">the subjective and the objective and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:25.520" style="s2">that is not done statically all this</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.959" end="00:01:29.090" style="s2">mediation but a mutual affordance is</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.520" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">done and an ongoing transformative</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.090" end="00:01:34.709" style="s2">trance framing and that the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:38.569" style="s2">captures all of this and then I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.709" end="00:01:40.709" style="s2">to bring out Corbin&#39;s core symbol and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.569" end="00:01:43.049" style="s2">it&#39;s a core symbol that relates directly</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.709" end="00:01:44.939" style="s2">to gnosis because in gnosis and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.049" end="00:01:47.729" style="s2">transformative participatory knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.939" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">this goes to the core of Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.729" end="00:01:53.789" style="s2">notion of design the being whose being</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:56.999" style="s2">is in question we write half to see self</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.789" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">knowledge and knowledge of the world as</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.999" end="00:02:03.779" style="s2">inextricably bound up together in order</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:07.349" style="s2">to do that we are pursuing Corbin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.779" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">central symbol the angel which of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.349" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">is immediately off-putting to many</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:16.920" style="s2">people including myself but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:19.260" style="s2">trying to get a way of articulating how</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.920" end="00:02:23.180" style="s2">Corbin is incorporating both Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.260" end="00:02:27.050" style="s2">and Persian Sufism Neoplatonic Sufism</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.180" end="00:02:29.870" style="s2">into this understanding of the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.050" end="00:02:31.460" style="s2">and I recommended that we take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.870" end="00:02:35.950" style="s2">the work of first of all of staying the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.460" end="00:02:40.070" style="s2">historical work showing how throughout</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.950" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">the ancient Mediterranean world and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.070" end="00:02:44.900" style="s2">up and through the Hellenistic period</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:48.620" style="s2">and beyond up until the period of easily</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.900" end="00:02:52.550" style="s2">our pseudo-dionysius around you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.620" end="00:02:54.980" style="s2">fifth century of the Common Era</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.550" end="00:02:59.320" style="s2">there&#39;s the pursuit of the divine double</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.980" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">and then the idea is one that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.320" end="00:03:04.760" style="s2">transgressive of our cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.790" end="00:03:08.150" style="s2">grammar of decadent Romanticism where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.760" end="00:03:10.520" style="s2">have a we are born with our true self</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.150" end="00:03:11.990" style="s2">that nearly needs to express itself a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.520" end="00:03:15.260" style="s2">Larusso</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.990" end="00:03:17.630" style="s2">and that author the core virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.260" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">authentic authenticity which is being</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.630" end="00:03:24.320" style="s2">right true to the true self that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:26.330" style="s2">have you know you possess rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.320" end="00:03:28.250" style="s2">for example a Socratic model in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.330" end="00:03:30.890" style="s2">the true self is something towards which</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.250" end="00:03:33.080" style="s2">you are constantly aspiring and then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.890" end="00:03:34.790" style="s2">recommended trying to make this so and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.080" end="00:03:37.550" style="s2">what&#39;s the transgressive mythology sorry</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.790" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">the transgressive mythology is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.550" end="00:03:42.020" style="s2">their self that I have now is not my</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:45.080" style="s2">true self my true self is my divine</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.020" end="00:03:47.690" style="s2">double this is right something that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.080" end="00:03:50.270" style="s2">superlative to me it is not it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.690" end="00:03:52.580" style="s2">bound to me it is my double right it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.270" end="00:03:54.500" style="s2">bound to me and but it is superlative to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.580" end="00:03:56.930" style="s2">me it is both me and not me it&#39;s me as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.500" end="00:03:59.480" style="s2">meant to be as I should be and that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.930" end="00:04:01.970" style="s2">project right the existential project is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.480" end="00:04:05.959" style="s2">not one of expressing a self that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.970" end="00:04:09.980" style="s2">have but of transcending to become a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.959" end="00:04:12.950" style="s2">self that is ecstatically ahead of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.980" end="00:04:14.990" style="s2">in an important way and then I pointed</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.950" end="00:04:17.780" style="s2">out that for many of you this would</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.990" end="00:04:19.370" style="s2">still be sort of like okay but I get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.780" end="00:04:21.350" style="s2">transgression but I still find this</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.370" end="00:04:24.260" style="s2">notion of a divine double unpalatable</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.350" end="00:04:26.300" style="s2">maybe for some of you you don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.260" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">nevertheless I think there is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.300" end="00:04:30.770" style="s2">important way by picking up on like by</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.270" end="00:04:33.050" style="s2">asking the question why did so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.770" end="00:04:35.810" style="s2">people for so long believed in they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.050" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">so deeply picking up on the question of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.810" end="00:04:40.810" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there and focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:43.490" style="s2">the this aspirational process</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.810" end="00:04:46.220" style="s2">and this takes us back into work that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.490" end="00:04:48.200" style="s2">that was core to the discussion I made</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.220" end="00:04:52.070" style="s2">about gnosis and it has had a resounding</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.200" end="00:04:53.630" style="s2">impact at various places throughout this</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.070" end="00:04:55.190" style="s2">series which is La Paul&#39;s work on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.630" end="00:04:57.320" style="s2">transformative experience and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.190" end="00:05:01.010" style="s2">somebody from who&#39;s from the same school</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.320" end="00:05:02.650" style="s2">influenced by Paul having a different</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.010" end="00:05:05.180" style="s2">viewer as Paul is more her</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.650" end="00:05:07.970" style="s2">transformations are more like insight</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.180" end="00:05:09.500" style="s2">Agnes Coward&#39;s notion of aspiration is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.970" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">much more developmental but I argue that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.500" end="00:05:13.780" style="s2">they can be I think readily reconciled</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:17.570" style="s2">together if you see development as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.780" end="00:05:19.190" style="s2">link sequence of of insights to bring</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.570" end="00:05:22.970" style="s2">about qualitative change in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.190" end="00:05:26.750" style="s2">competence so we were zeroing in on this</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.970" end="00:05:29.480" style="s2">right I&#39;m using la Paul and Agnes Keller</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.750" end="00:05:31.940" style="s2">to triangulate in to this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.480" end="00:05:33.740" style="s2">of aspiration and picking up first of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.940" end="00:05:35.870" style="s2">all on Keller&#39;s important point that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.740" end="00:05:39.470" style="s2">not addressed and this is an important</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.870" end="00:05:42.140" style="s2">point by la paul the the the deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.470" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">connections between aspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.140" end="00:05:48.500" style="s2">rationality that rationality is itself a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:50.090" style="s2">rash is an aspirational process and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.500" end="00:05:52.790" style="s2">we make the process by which we cut</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.090" end="00:05:55.310" style="s2">become rational itself not a rational or</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.790" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">irrational process we will get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.310" end="00:06:01.130" style="s2">serious a position that it&#39;s seriously</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:04.130" style="s2">self undermining similarly if the way in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.130" end="00:06:06.470" style="s2">which you become wise does not involve</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.130" end="00:06:08.690" style="s2">sort of wise acts and behavior if the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.470" end="00:06:10.820" style="s2">process itself is not itself wise you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.690" end="00:06:12.680" style="s2">going to get into all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.820" end="00:06:14.840" style="s2">difficulties if it&#39;s not in some sense a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.680" end="00:06:17.690" style="s2">rational process again last time I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.840" end="00:06:20.260" style="s2">reminded you how broadly but I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.690" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">also deeply I&#39;m using the term rational</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.260" end="00:06:25.460" style="s2">or happy being educated I mean we we</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:27.110" style="s2">make ourselves better maybe even more</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.460" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">rational or wiser by going through an</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.110" end="00:06:31.250" style="s2">education but education at least a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:33.560" style="s2">liberal education is a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.250" end="00:06:36.590" style="s2">aspirational process if that itself is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.560" end="00:06:38.300" style="s2">not part of what makes us rational is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.590" end="00:06:40.730" style="s2">that if it&#39;s not itself a rational</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.300" end="00:06:44.270" style="s2">process then of course our rationality</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.730" end="00:06:46.940" style="s2">is again being undermined and and right</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.270" end="00:06:49.160" style="s2">self contradictory fashion so the basics</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.940" end="00:06:52.810" style="s2">of this argument is if we take if we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.160" end="00:06:54.620" style="s2">not understand a kind of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.810" end="00:06:56.870" style="s2">colored calls program</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.620" end="00:07:01.040" style="s2">thick rationality that&#39;s the rationality</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.870" end="00:07:04.940" style="s2">of aspiration the rationality that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.040" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">allows you right that is the rationality</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.940" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">that emerges in education that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:13.070" style="s2">in the cultivation of rationality that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:15.890" style="s2">emerges in the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.070" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">then a lot of human behavior is Right</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.890" end="00:07:20.300" style="s2">improv is not going to be called</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:21.950" style="s2">rational and it&#39;s going then that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.300" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">going to render our notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.950" end="00:07:26.030" style="s2">rationality as I&#39;ve said self</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:28.130" style="s2">contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.030" end="00:07:31.910" style="s2">self undermining in some very</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.130" end="00:07:36.110" style="s2">fundamental ways and so again we see the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.910" end="00:07:40.520" style="s2">rejoining of right love and reason that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.110" end="00:07:44.150" style="s2">was originally talked about so deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.520" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">Plato so now we&#39;ve come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.150" end="00:07:49.070" style="s2">problem I gave you the example of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:51.890" style="s2">somebody in a liberal education and this</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.070" end="00:07:54.050" style="s2">is a colorants example right here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.890" end="00:07:56.060" style="s2">self at this time and this self at this</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.050" end="00:07:58.280" style="s2">time and something I brought out that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.060" end="00:08:00.410" style="s2">color doesn&#39;t but important because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.280" end="00:08:01.940" style="s2">a it&#39;s it it&#39;s a concise way of talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.410" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">about the relationship between them and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.940" end="00:08:06.620" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t a direct inferential</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:13.370" style="s2">relationship between these which is non</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.620" end="00:08:15.590" style="s2">logical identity right this is part and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.370" end="00:08:16.790" style="s2">parcel like think about what I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.590" end="00:08:18.500" style="s2">said earlier helped me broaden the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.790" end="00:08:20.090" style="s2">notion of rationality outside of logic</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.500" end="00:08:21.920" style="s2">if calor does right and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.090" end="00:08:24.170" style="s2">include rationality proleptic</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.920" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">rationality in our model of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.170" end="00:08:28.220" style="s2">and involves its non logical identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:30.110" style="s2">then of course we&#39;re stepping beyond</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.220" end="00:08:33.020" style="s2">sort of a purely logical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.110" end="00:08:38.330" style="s2">of rationality yet again for yet another</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.020" end="00:08:39.980" style="s2">reason okay so what&#39;s the problem here</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.330" end="00:08:43.190" style="s2">though well the problem is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.980" end="00:08:45.890" style="s2">of non logical identity so we I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.190" end="00:08:48.470" style="s2">appreciate always remember both meanings</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.890" end="00:08:50.960" style="s2">of that term too deeply and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.470" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">interwoven the two sides of aspiration I</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.960" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">deeply understand it and I deep I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:09:01.550" style="s2">deeply grateful for it I value it right</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.009" end="00:09:27.720" style="s2">of course I&#39;m not actually aspiring</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.139" end="00:09:29.970" style="s2">because this person doesn&#39;t appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.720" end="00:09:32.009" style="s2">classical music because it impresses</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">like there&#39;s something right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.790" end="00:10:19.230" style="s2">fundamental discontinuity here okay now</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:22.499" style="s2">to bring out the problem that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.230" end="00:10:24.299" style="s2">sort of resolve and bring back and tie</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.499" end="00:10:27.209" style="s2">this back to the notion of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.299" end="00:10:28.529" style="s2">double I want to talk about April a in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.209" end="00:10:31.049" style="s2">which Callard</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.529" end="00:10:36.929" style="s2">shows us how this is problematic as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.049" end="00:10:39.869" style="s2">try to talk about it and she makes use</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.929" end="00:10:44.999" style="s2">of the work of Strawson Galen Strawson</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.869" end="00:10:49.350" style="s2">and he talks about a paradox of of self</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.999" end="00:10:54.749" style="s2">creation right now Strawson points out</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.350" end="00:10:56.669" style="s2">that for self creation and doesn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.749" end="00:11:02.100" style="s2">look like self creation here&#39;s a self</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.669" end="00:11:05.850" style="s2">creating itself right right for self</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.100" end="00:11:09.720" style="s2">creation be too true to be truly an</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.850" end="00:11:11.910" style="s2">instance of self and creation sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.720" end="00:11:14.339" style="s2">emphasizing both sides of that double</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.910" end="00:11:18.119" style="s2">form two things are needed one</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.339" end="00:11:20.069" style="s2">requirement right is a continuity</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.119" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">requirement there has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.069" end="00:11:23.709" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:27.100" style="s2">continuous between s1 and s2 because</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.709" end="00:11:30.279" style="s2">right if they are not the same self then</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.100" end="00:11:32.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not an act of self creation right</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.279" end="00:11:35.529" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same self it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.740" end="00:11:44.260" style="s2">act of self creation so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.529" end="00:11:46.209" style="s2">continuity requirement and so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.260" end="00:11:50.200" style="s2">to represent it like this right</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.209" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">s1 equals s2 so what this means is if</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.200" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">like if s1 is hit by a motorcycle and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:57.670" style="s2">their brain is damaged and right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:00.370" style="s2">they act and behave in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.670" end="00:12:03.790" style="s2">that&#39;s not an act of self creation that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.370" end="00:12:06.640" style="s2">is not an act of self creation s1 has to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.790" end="00:12:09.490" style="s2">be totally responsible for s2 or else</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.640" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">it&#39;s not an act of self creation putting</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.490" end="00:12:17.290" style="s2">an emphasis on the self okay but now</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.350" end="00:12:20.700" style="s2">let&#39;s shift to the creation side right</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.290" end="00:12:24.130" style="s2">which is that there has to be real</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.700" end="00:12:27.940" style="s2">novelty between them or else there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.130" end="00:12:30.190" style="s2">creation involved if s1 just develops a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.940" end="00:12:34.300" style="s2">skill or ability they already have that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.190" end="00:12:37.000" style="s2">is not real novelty that is just more of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.300" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">the same that&#39;s quantitative development</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.000" end="00:12:43.779" style="s2">not qualitative development so right if</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:46.300" style="s2">all that happens is s1 you know improve</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.779" end="00:12:49.810" style="s2">their skill you know deepens their</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.300" end="00:12:54.520" style="s2">capacity to acquire something that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.810" end="00:12:56.890" style="s2">already value etc that right is not real</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.520" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">novelty so real novelty means there has</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.890" end="00:13:02.050" style="s2">to be a fundamental difference between</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:05.320" style="s2">s1 and s2</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.050" end="00:13:09.640" style="s2">now what Strawson does with this right</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.320" end="00:13:11.740" style="s2">is he points out notice how right in s1</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.640" end="00:13:13.329" style="s2">and s2 for the continuity requirement</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.740" end="00:13:15.130" style="s2">have to be equal but the real novelty</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.329" end="00:13:17.769" style="s2">means there has to be a real deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.130" end="00:13:19.660" style="s2">difference between s1 and s2 right or</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.769" end="00:13:21.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not creation and the permanent so</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.660" end="00:13:23.860" style="s2">what he argues is the argues that self</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.730" end="00:13:25.240" style="s2">creation is paradoxical in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.860" end="00:13:27.310" style="s2">point he&#39;s trying to make is its self</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.240" end="00:13:31.709" style="s2">contradictory there can be no such thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.310" end="00:13:31.709" style="s2">as self creation right</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:38.889" style="s2">so another way of thinking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.359" end="00:13:41.229" style="s2">if you remember when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.889" end="00:13:43.899" style="s2">this in connection with transformative</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.229" end="00:13:47.799" style="s2">experience we can invokes voters notion</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.899" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">of the idea that you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.799" end="00:13:54.369" style="s2">sort of create a stronger logic by</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:56.949" style="s2">logically manipulating a weaker logic no</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.369" end="00:13:59.589" style="s2">matter how much I manipulate the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.949" end="00:14:01.839" style="s2">machinery of predicate logic I won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.589" end="00:14:05.169" style="s2">modal logic because what I have to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.839" end="00:14:07.809" style="s2">right is I have to introduce axioms that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.169" end="00:14:10.569" style="s2">are outside forged Elian reasons</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.809" end="00:14:15.339" style="s2">ultimately are outside the system of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.569" end="00:14:18.970" style="s2">predicate logic so putting it this way</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.339" end="00:14:21.970" style="s2">right in order to get the real novelty</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.970" end="00:14:25.209" style="s2">between s1 and s2 I have to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.970" end="00:14:27.669" style="s2">something that&#39;s outside the logic of s1</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.209" end="00:14:31.989" style="s2">the logic of its values and beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.669" end="00:14:34.660" style="s2">right that will then make it into s2 but</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.989" end="00:14:36.759" style="s2">if it comes from outside of s1 it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.660" end="00:14:39.779" style="s2">foreign and strange and right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.759" end="00:14:45.609" style="s2">therefore it right is not an act of self</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.779" end="00:14:47.679" style="s2">creation what that shows voters idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.609" end="00:14:49.749" style="s2">about you can&#39;t infer a stronger logic</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.679" end="00:14:51.699" style="s2">from a weaker logic and it goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.749" end="00:14:54.069" style="s2">a point we&#39;ve made before there is no</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.699" end="00:14:58.209" style="s2">inferential way there&#39;s no way you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.069" end="00:15:00.309" style="s2">sort of infer yourself from s1 to s2 and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.209" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">this of course is part of kirkegaard</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.309" end="00:15:05.499" style="s2">whole point about the leap and the leap</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:08.169" style="s2">of faith the leap of faith is to leap</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.499" end="00:15:09.669" style="s2">into a process of development that is</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.539" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">this this goes against our normal way of</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:57.000" style="s2">this is temporarily prior but this is</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.150" end="00:22:31.390" style="s2">causes is also the thing that is the</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.390" end="00:22:35.870" style="s2">now the temptation here of course is to</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.890" end="00:22:40.190" style="s2">be teleological to think that in some</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.620" end="00:23:11.540" style="s2">before and earlier on in the series is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.320" end="00:23:13.490" style="s2">that the the pineal are the teleological</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.270" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">about so let&#39;s try and do this a little</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.710" end="00:23:29.900" style="s2">bit more slowly I want I want to say s1</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:33.620" style="s2">has the causal power but s2 has the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.900" end="00:23:38.180" style="s2">normative authority so s1 has the causal</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.960" end="00:24:04.790" style="s2">authority over me how do i how do I do</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.570" end="00:24:08.510" style="s2">that well I sort of slipped it in there</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.790" end="00:24:10.850" style="s2">right I sort of slipped it in there when</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.510" end="00:24:11.900" style="s2">I talked about right aspiring to be like</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.540" end="00:24:35.930" style="s2">are deeply those two points are deeply</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.930" end="00:24:41.630" style="s2">right and my representation of that</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.630" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">me now has to afford me somehow tapping</p>

<p begin="00:24:59.330" end="00:25:07.880" style="s2">me become a more rational person now</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.130" end="00:25:11.030" style="s2">notice of course what this means what</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.880" end="00:25:13.640" style="s2">kind of thing does this for me and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.030" end="00:25:16.340" style="s2">is Corbin&#39;s point it&#39;s a symbol not in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.640" end="00:25:19.670" style="s2">the imaginary sense but in the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.340" end="00:25:22.520" style="s2">sense it&#39;s only a symbol that right puts</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.670" end="00:25:25.370" style="s2">these two together in the right way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.520" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">a kind of relationship that right</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">identical it is not something that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.090" end="00:25:33.920" style="s2">processed in a purely logical fashion it</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:35.660" style="s2">is a representation that is</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.660" end="00:25:41.809" style="s2">to actually afford you going through the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.880" end="00:25:47.179" style="s2">transformative process now let&#39;s add a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.809" end="00:25:51.260" style="s2">little bit more my representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.179" end="00:25:53.240" style="s2">aspire to self is it&#39;s a symbolic self</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.260" end="00:25:55.929" style="s2">it&#39;s a symbolic self that I can</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.929" end="00:26:03.050" style="s2">anagogical ii right this is remember we</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.540" end="00:26:05.420" style="s2">talked about this we become we transcend</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.050" end="00:26:08.929" style="s2">ourselves by internalizing how other</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.420" end="00:26:11.330" style="s2">people&#39;s perspectives are being directed</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.929" end="00:26:13.190" style="s2">on us right so remember Spencer</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.330" end="00:26:16.510" style="s2">internalizes my perspective so that he</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.190" end="00:26:19.190" style="s2">becomes metacognitive the stoic aspirant</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.510" end="00:26:22.010" style="s2">internalizes Socrates so that he can</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.190" end="00:26:25.070" style="s2">self transcend and become more Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.010" end="00:26:26.779" style="s2">right so the symbolic self has</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.070" end="00:26:28.419" style="s2">to be internalized and notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.779" end="00:26:31.789" style="s2">happening in internalization</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.419" end="00:26:34.580" style="s2">internalization is something other than</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.789" end="00:26:37.970" style="s2">you yet it becomes something that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.580" end="00:26:40.190" style="s2">completely identified as you not just as</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.970" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">an idea right it becomes part of your</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.190" end="00:26:45.769" style="s2">metacognitive reflective rationality in</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:48.049" style="s2">the case of internalizing Socrates it</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.769" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">becomes part of the very guts of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.049" end="00:26:56.379" style="s2">machinery of yourself why anagogical II</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:27:00.049" style="s2">because what I&#39;m doing right is I am</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.379" end="00:27:02.860" style="s2">internalizing this symbol this symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.049" end="00:27:06.110" style="s2">self and what it&#39;s doing is its</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.860" end="00:27:08.360" style="s2">reordering my psyche so that I see</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.110" end="00:27:10.580" style="s2">different ways of being in the world and</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:18.440" style="s2">internalize remember this I internalized</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:20.179" style="s2">Socrates and right right and then I end</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.440" end="00:27:21.860" style="s2">well the world in a more Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.179" end="00:27:24.259" style="s2">fashion which allows me to better</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.860" end="00:27:25.940" style="s2">internalized Socrates so that I end well</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.940" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">perhaps for the Christian right right</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.809" end="00:27:40.340" style="s2">they right so there&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.340" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">an agogic and that Ana gothic process</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.830" end="00:27:47.659" style="s2">takes off of its own accord but it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.030" end="00:28:12.680" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing is you have this</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.590" end="00:28:46.150" style="s2">suggesting to you is the divine double</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:48.800" style="s2">is amethyst way of trying to capture</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.150" end="00:28:53.060" style="s2">this dynamic process which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.800" end="00:28:54.800" style="s2">discussed at length in this series and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.060" end="00:28:56.930" style="s2">what it does is it represents this</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.800" end="00:29:01.070" style="s2">process and kind of a linear narrative</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.930" end="00:29:04.340" style="s2">and therefore it simplifies it into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.070" end="00:29:06.530" style="s2">simple kind of teleology but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.340" end="00:29:09.920" style="s2">sense in which I think that peoole ology</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.530" end="00:29:13.100" style="s2">is overly simplistic it&#39;s not capturing</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.920" end="00:29:15.470" style="s2">the participatory nature the danger with</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.100" end="00:29:18.350" style="s2">the teleology of course is it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.470" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">overemphasize the passive receptivity on</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.350" end="00:29:28.370" style="s2">the part of s1 in the face of s2 so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">divine double I think what people were</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.260" end="00:34:29.020" style="s2">has an angel right because it&#39;s not only</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.560" end="00:34:50.930" style="s2">is a thing beyond itself and so you are</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:42.970" style="s2">seems to bind us a little too much to</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.940" end="00:36:30.470" style="s2">talked about the Buddha nature and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.800" end="00:36:32.270" style="s2">Buddha nature is very much the Aspire</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.470" end="00:36:37.250" style="s2">itself but things have a Buddha nature</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.270" end="00:36:39.350" style="s2">the Buddha nature is both their ultimate</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.279" end="00:36:52.289" style="s2">pointing out is that this way of talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.829" end="00:36:55.440" style="s2">about aspiration can be seen clearly in</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.289" end="00:36:57.960" style="s2">non theistic religions it&#39;s clearly in</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.440" end="00:37:00.089" style="s2">Gnosticism which i think is very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.960" end="00:37:01.740" style="s2">should not be interpreted atheistical ii</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.089" end="00:37:04.499" style="s2">i&#39;ve tried to show you that it&#39;s clearly</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.499" end="00:37:09.420" style="s2">this case for it both in Platonists and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.279" end="00:37:13.049" style="s2">aspects that at least the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.420" end="00:37:16.019" style="s2">aspects of Dionysius and so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.049" end="00:37:18.210" style="s2">clearly not theistic so i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.019" end="00:37:18.839" style="s2">use the devant of the term divine double</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.210" end="00:37:21.480" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.839" end="00:37:24.420" style="s2">because i want to try and separate this</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.480" end="00:37:29.549" style="s2">idea from its commitment to theism and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.420" end="00:37:33.210" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna call this symbolic self I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.549" end="00:37:36.539" style="s2">gonna call it the sacred second self the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.210" end="00:37:38.279" style="s2">sacred second itself it gives me even</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.539" end="00:37:43.950" style="s2">more alliteration than divine double so</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.279" end="00:37:48.630" style="s2">I win right so so the idea of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.950" end="00:37:53.089" style="s2">second self perhaps perhaps this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.630" end="00:37:55.529" style="s2">way wow I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.089" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna do right now but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.529" end="00:38:03.989" style="s2">gonna do it because I have an inkling of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">its value perhaps the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.989" end="00:38:11.700" style="s2">sacred second self is a way of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:13.289" style="s2">back the idea of having a soul in fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.700" end="00:38:15.029" style="s2">that&#39;s even the wrong way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.289" end="00:38:19.170" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.029" end="00:38:22.170" style="s2">to transgress against your sacred second</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.170" end="00:38:24.900" style="s2">self is us the soul that you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.170" end="00:38:28.559" style="s2">becoming the soul that you are aspiring</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.900" end="00:38:31.079" style="s2">through and - and perhaps that is a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.559" end="00:38:33.180" style="s2">of bringing it back the reason I raise</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.079" end="00:38:35.880" style="s2">this is because that will allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.180" end="00:38:36.569" style="s2">make a bridge to another one of the</p>

<p begin="00:38:36.569" end="00:38:43.759" style="s2">Carl Gustav Jung because this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.309" end="00:38:47.849" style="s2">a relationship to a sacred second self</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.759" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">that is perhaps what we were always</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.930" end="00:39:13.690" style="s2">lost his soul now that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.829" end="00:39:27.039" style="s2">though I&#39;m going to argue the loss of a</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.039" end="00:39:32.170" style="s2">self that is needed for responding to</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.130" end="00:39:34.359" style="s2">the meeting crisis and there are deep</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.359" end="00:39:41.470" style="s2">Corbin and this is not just similarity</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.609" end="00:39:43.869" style="s2">of argumentation Jung and Corbin had</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.470" end="00:39:45.910" style="s2">deep had a deep interaction a deep</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.869" end="00:39:47.650" style="s2">influence on each other they met</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.910" end="00:39:49.930" style="s2">regularly together at the Uranus</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.650" end="00:39:52.420" style="s2">conferences and discussed as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.930" end="00:39:53.829" style="s2">I find that Corbin is more responsible</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.420" end="00:39:55.569" style="s2">through that relationship than young</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.829" end="00:39:56.470" style="s2">Corbin talks more often about it</p>

<p begin="00:40:07.089" end="00:40:12.339" style="s2">between Corbin and Jung by picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.609" end="00:40:15.099" style="s2">this idea of your relationship to your</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.339" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">sacred second self and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.099" end="00:40:19.420" style="s2">the best way to understanding the</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.289" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">development and a notion of self</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.750" end="00:40:30.789" style="s2">transformation and a notion of how to</p>

<p begin="00:40:30.789" end="00:40:42.809" style="s2">crisis this is Jung&#39;s notion of course</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.970" end="00:40:48.660" style="s2">so how do we get to this notion well</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.550" end="00:40:50.790" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get to this note notice</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.660" end="00:40:54.869" style="s2">that each thinker gets into it in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.790" end="00:40:56.700" style="s2">different way and what Jung is doing and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.869" end="00:41:00.300" style="s2">he&#39;s right he&#39;s picking up on something</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.700" end="00:41:02.700" style="s2">that is not it&#39;s not really present in</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.700" end="00:41:08.069" style="s2">present more implicitly than explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:11.579" style="s2">and this is psychology right the the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.069" end="00:41:15.390" style="s2">processes within that psyche that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.579" end="00:41:20.760" style="s2">conducive to responding to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.390" end="00:41:22.290" style="s2">crisis and by individuation Jung and he</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.760" end="00:41:24.660" style="s2">clearly uses this adjective to describe</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.290" end="00:41:27.420" style="s2">it describes this as a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.660" end="00:41:30.420" style="s2">process now the way to get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.420" end="00:41:34.670" style="s2">clearer about how young is using the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.420" end="00:41:37.619" style="s2">notion of psychological is right to</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.670" end="00:41:40.920" style="s2">contrast him to the most important</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.619" end="00:41:43.290" style="s2">influence on him his progenitor Freud</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.920" end="00:41:47.400" style="s2">and I&#39;m not going to get into a deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.290" end="00:41:50.790" style="s2">analysis of Freud I&#39;m right that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.400" end="00:41:53.099" style="s2">would be too far afield Freud is a Titan</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.790" end="00:41:54.660" style="s2">even if 95% of what Freud is said is</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.099" end="00:41:56.220" style="s2">wrong it doesn&#39;t matter he gets to be in</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.660" end="00:41:58.859" style="s2">the Hall of the Immortals because he</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.220" end="00:42:00.690" style="s2">came up with the idea of the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.859" end="00:42:02.099" style="s2">he comes up with the idea of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.690" end="00:42:04.530" style="s2">neither nature nor nurture but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.099" end="00:42:06.569" style="s2">interaction between them in stages of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.530" end="00:42:08.700" style="s2">development is these are all just they</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.569" end="00:42:10.829" style="s2">become so deeply interwoven with our</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.700" end="00:42:12.780" style="s2">fundamental way of trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.829" end="00:42:15.150" style="s2">and theorize about ourselves like I said</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.780" end="00:42:17.490" style="s2">so Freud is a Titanic figure however</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.150" end="00:42:20.010" style="s2">let&#39;s pick up on the difference in what</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.490" end="00:42:21.869" style="s2">fundamental way did Jung&#39;s model of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.010" end="00:42:24.750" style="s2">psyche different from different from</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.869" end="00:42:26.730" style="s2">Freud&#39;s so here I&#39;m picking up on work</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.750" end="00:42:29.270" style="s2">done by paul ricoeur in his book on</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.730" end="00:42:33.329" style="s2">freud and some work done by store</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.270" end="00:42:36.390" style="s2">anthony store in his work on young in an</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.329" end="00:42:38.190" style="s2">important contrast so freud ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.390" end="00:42:40.319" style="s2">has what has been called a hydraulic</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.190" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">model of the psyche it&#39;s so the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.319" end="00:42:43.530" style="s2">is basically a Newtonian machine like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:45.690" style="s2">steam engine</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.530" end="00:42:47.339" style="s2">things are under pressure and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.690" end="00:42:49.230" style="s2">pressure has to be relieved and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.339" end="00:42:54.660" style="s2">drives and sort of pushes various</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.230" end="00:42:56.369" style="s2">processes into operation so Freud and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.660" end="00:42:58.410" style="s2">and of course this makes perfect sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.369" end="00:43:02.299" style="s2">Freud has a new toe</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.410" end="00:43:06.180" style="s2">machine hydraulic model of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.299" end="00:43:08.700" style="s2">Yong ultimately rejects that and this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.180" end="00:43:11.160" style="s2">more in store than in record because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.700" end="00:43:15.780" style="s2">course we&#39;re not primarily concentrating</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.160" end="00:43:19.140" style="s2">on Freud but what store argues is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.780" end="00:43:20.549" style="s2">and this becomes clear in the language</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.140" end="00:43:23.220" style="s2">and the metaphors that Jung use Jung</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.549" end="00:43:26.599" style="s2">replaces that hydraulic metaphor with an</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.220" end="00:43:29.039" style="s2">organic metaphor he sees the psyche as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.599" end="00:43:37.230" style="s2">self-organizing dynamical system</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.039" end="00:43:39.930" style="s2">ultimately as an auto poetic being so he</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.230" end="00:43:42.450" style="s2">sees the psyche as going through sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.930" end="00:43:44.579" style="s2">a complex process of self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.450" end="00:43:48.410" style="s2">and that you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.579" end="00:43:51.180" style="s2">individuation as this kind of organic</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.410" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">self-organizing organic self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.180" end="00:43:58.819" style="s2">process that you neither make nor</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:44:01.170" style="s2">receive but you participate in okay so</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.819" end="00:44:04.950" style="s2">this takes us to one of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.170" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">quintessential notions from Jung Jung</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.950" end="00:44:10.200" style="s2">gives a psychological an allure Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:13.020" style="s2">idea of the form a structural functional</p>

<p begin="00:44:15.980" end="00:44:20.369" style="s2">people should go back arkaid</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.140" end="00:44:21.960" style="s2">foundational like in archeology getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.369" end="00:44:24.450" style="s2">to the origins and the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.960" end="00:44:26.660" style="s2">tip-offs the patterns so the archetypes</p>

<p begin="00:44:26.660" end="00:44:33.299" style="s2">founding patterns of the psyche these</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.349" end="00:44:35.309" style="s2">are the ways in which these are the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.299" end="00:44:37.410" style="s2">structural functional organizations by</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.099" end="00:44:46.980" style="s2">therefore very much psychological</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.579" end="00:44:49.710" style="s2">versions of the Platonic forms and Jung</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.980" end="00:44:54.150" style="s2">is much better at acknowledging plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.710" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">influence than Freud is for example so</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.150" end="00:45:03.329" style="s2">the archetypes are not images right the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">archetypes are not images right you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.329" end="00:45:11.490" style="s2">to take the images and treat them in an</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.700" end="00:50:17.970" style="s2">ultimately that can be can become part</p>

<p begin="00:50:55.470" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">self I noticed ultimately how that falls</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.230" end="00:51:05.339" style="s2">back to Plato and Socrates this notion</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.769" end="00:51:14.309" style="s2">again of Jung&#39;s deep right deep</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.170" end="00:51:33.530" style="s2">why is young so critical of literalism</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.940" end="00:51:35.930" style="s2">and fundamentalism because it is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.530" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">reduce the imaginal nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.930" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">archetypes into simply being imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:44.510" style="s2">it is to lose the being mode and since</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:46.670" style="s2">the simply having of subjective</p>

<p begin="00:51:52.190" end="00:51:56.990" style="s2">a form of inflation in which the ego</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:52:00.860" style="s2">pretends that it is sufficient unto</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.990" end="00:52:03.020" style="s2">itself and tries to take on the right</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.020" end="00:52:09.470" style="s2">self tries to just have an identity</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.260" end="00:52:12.050" style="s2">rather than continually becoming in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.470" end="00:52:15.950" style="s2">process of individuation it is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.050" end="00:52:19.850" style="s2">disturbing to see someone who is would</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.300" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">young young understands all of this and</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.870" end="00:53:07.700" style="s2">that&#39;s how I&#39;ve explained it to you as</p>

<p begin="00:53:13.010" end="00:53:19.480" style="s2">end Jung seems to be breaking out of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.890" end="00:53:21.530" style="s2">this purely psychological way of talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.480" end="00:53:25.580" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.820" end="00:53:32.870" style="s2">course this is problematic right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.220" end="00:53:35.000" style="s2">this is what Corbin was trying to get</p>

<p begin="00:53:41.809" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">within the mind the archetypes are</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:53.749" style="s2">in young as subjectively rather than</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.099" end="00:53:55.400" style="s2">transductive ly and because of this and</p>

<p begin="00:55:20.209" end="00:55:25.400" style="s2">indwelling in the world that Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.789" end="00:55:29.269" style="s2">right is pointing to and Heidegger</p>

<p begin="00:55:31.130" end="00:55:36.469" style="s2">the internalization looks like how does</p>

<p begin="00:55:38.150" end="00:55:41.390" style="s2">suggesting to you this is neither Corbin</p>
