<p begin="00:00:09.620" end="00:00:16.289" style="s2">so I was thinking today I like what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:18.840" style="s2">really wanted to well I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.289" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">all week and listening to your book your</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.840" end="00:00:23.570" style="s2">audiobook and thinking about what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:28.130" style="s2">really wanted to talk to you about and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.570" end="00:00:32.910" style="s2">what comes up the most really is is</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.130" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">America America yeah the United States</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.910" end="00:00:40.430" style="s2">of America or let&#39;s say America as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:44.210" style="s2">concept America as a as a country the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.430" end="00:00:46.700" style="s2">dystopian and the utopian qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.210" end="00:00:49.020" style="s2">America I think you&#39;re uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.700" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">qualified to talk about that because you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.020" end="00:00:56.699" style="s2">spent so much time in sort of subculture</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:59.579" style="s2">America or let&#39;s say alternative America</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.699" end="00:01:03.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what exactly to call it in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">search of let&#39;s say X status community</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.180" end="00:01:08.010" style="s2">tasks either some of the words you use</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">in your book a lot yeah yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.010" end="00:01:14.520" style="s2">know and I don&#39;t usually you know might</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">in my current public biography kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">stuff it doesn&#39;t usually feature very</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">strongly but I mean I was all but done</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">on a dissertation in American history so</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">so I&#39;m actually trained academically as</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:28.380" style="s2">an American historian and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">anthropologist oh how interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.380" end="00:01:33.570" style="s2">in addition then personally we also went</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">searching for the last best places in</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.570" end="00:01:38.850" style="s2">America and following that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">Promethean thread revival culture you</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.850" end="00:01:43.430" style="s2">know and again academically studying it</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">from the 17th through the 20th centuries</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.430" end="00:01:48.840" style="s2">experientially going and checking out</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">all these seeming hotbeds and bubbling</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">ups of that kind of culture coming out</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:56.850" style="s2">of the 50s and 60s mm-hmm so both as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">participant observer and then also from</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.850" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">an academic perspective that&#39;s kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">found myself almost like a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">Alexis de Tocqueville you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">famous a Frenchman ooh who came to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:11.069" style="s2">u.s. in the middle of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">and wrote about America as a concept as</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.069" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">a meme in a way that Americans obviously</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:18.030" style="s2">couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:20.550" style="s2">because they were in it so yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.030" end="00:02:22.020" style="s2">think there&#39;s so many different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.550" end="00:02:25.260" style="s2">slice and dice this I mean in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.020" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">respects I think Gary Snyder the poet</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.260" end="00:02:30.840" style="s2">who wanted Pulitzer for his collection</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">total Island and was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.840" end="00:02:36.600" style="s2">preeminent beats and I mean arguably one</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:38.940" style="s2">of my most that one of the leading</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.600" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">lights of the 1960s counterculture I I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.940" end="00:02:46.170" style="s2">admire and respect the most and he has</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:47.730" style="s2">that beautiful beautiful poem of his I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:49.170" style="s2">went into the maverick bah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.730" end="00:02:51.480" style="s2">least I think it&#39;s his most anthologized</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.170" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">poem but there&#39;s some lines at the end</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.480" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">and he says he says America your</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:03:02.250" style="s2">stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:03.690" style="s2">I could almost love you again and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.250" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">said that he said like and he leaves the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.690" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">blog because he&#39;s talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:07.320" style="s2">dancing in this kind of redneck bar and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:10.290" style="s2">the intersection of the counterculture</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.320" end="00:03:12.150" style="s2">and and the locals and he says he says I</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.290" end="00:03:14.550" style="s2">went out you know he was out on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.150" end="00:03:17.880" style="s2">highway in the shadow of the bluffs</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.550" end="00:03:21.209" style="s2">under the tough old stars I came back to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.880" end="00:03:23.550" style="s2">myself to the real work to what is to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.209" end="00:03:27.230" style="s2">done mm-hmm and I think that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.550" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">juxtaposition of America&#39;s adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.230" end="00:03:32.490" style="s2">stupidity yeah right as a country bigger</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:34.140" style="s2">than its own brawn and never quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.490" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">knowing what to do with itself and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.140" end="00:03:37.980" style="s2">believing its own press clippings but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:39.959" style="s2">also you know the kind of Noam Chomsky</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.980" end="00:03:43.980" style="s2">critique actually exercising hegemonic</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.959" end="00:03:46.140" style="s2">Empire languaging of liberty and freedom</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.980" end="00:03:48.989" style="s2">for all you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.140" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">decidedly complex and mixed bag well as</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.989" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">Stegner who is one of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">leading literary lights of the american</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.090" end="00:03:57.209" style="s2">tradition he was the graduate professor</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:59.640" style="s2">of writing at stanford he&#39;s the one that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.209" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">actually taught ken kesey</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.640" end="00:04:03.780" style="s2">when Kesey showed up at stanford they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">then kicked off the whole psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.780" end="00:04:09.570" style="s2">explosion on the west coast sure he had</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">a he had a great phrase you know in</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.570" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">writing about the American West which</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:15.720" style="s2">was kind of his domain he said he said</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">it&#39;s the perennial project is can we</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.720" end="00:04:20.459" style="s2">create a society to match the scenery</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:23.160" style="s2">you know you just think of just the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.459" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">sheer rugged beauty and abundance of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.160" end="00:04:28.710" style="s2">North America as Turtle Island as a con</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">yeah then how the hell do we do the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.710" end="00:04:34.949" style="s2">human Inge on top of that and can we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:37.380" style="s2">actually live up to the purple mountain</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.949" end="00:04:40.710" style="s2">Majesties and every way this oversized</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.380" end="00:04:42.060" style="s2">beauty and rugged nature and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.710" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">almost like the people haven&#39;t learned</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.060" end="00:04:47.000" style="s2">to live there yet yeah there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">such a there seems to be a real</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.000" end="00:04:52.860" style="s2">connection or separation between the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:55.979" style="s2">urban you know all the urban ugliness of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:04:57.960" style="s2">the urban suburban society and then this</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.979" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">utopian project that keeps trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.960" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">install itself but never kind of lands</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">or yeah I mean I mean going all the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:05.610" style="s2">back to the 17th century and good old</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:07.110" style="s2">John Winthrop and the famous city you</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.610" end="00:05:09.720" style="s2">know shining city on a hill thing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.110" end="00:05:13.470" style="s2">then Reagan dusted off and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.720" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">rebooted the idea that in fact America</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.470" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">is in physical in physicality the actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">place and also in concept or ideology</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:25.940" style="s2">the potential of the fulfillment of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:29.340" style="s2">judeo-christian Redemption narrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.940" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">mmm-hmm and everywhere else is decline</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.340" end="00:05:34.289" style="s2">and decay and that here is a chance for</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:36.780" style="s2">fresh starts new beginnings getting it</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.289" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">right you know and fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.780" end="00:05:43.500" style="s2">attainment and that is one of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:46.380" style="s2">stronger mimetic drivers of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.500" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">unfolding of the history you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.380" end="00:05:51.889" style="s2">think that that&#39;s that&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:53.970" style="s2">both sort of beautiful and inspiring and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.889" end="00:05:58.710" style="s2">also deeply problematic</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.970" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">yeah and prone to prompting pathology in</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.710" end="00:06:02.909" style="s2">its articulation or expression and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:05.490" style="s2">you get nativism and populism you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.909" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">all sorts of things chauvinism you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.490" end="00:06:10.169" style="s2">all the isms schisms yeah springing from</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:13.949" style="s2">you know a stance like that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.169" end="00:06:15.900" style="s2">deep yeah if that&#39;s good I&#39;m glad you</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.949" end="00:06:17.070" style="s2">brought that up because because you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.900" end="00:06:19.050" style="s2">the other thing that kind of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.070" end="00:06:23.750" style="s2">interested in is is religion and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.050" end="00:06:26.210" style="s2">spirituality and it seemed like like</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.750" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">America is always trying to escape</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.210" end="00:06:31.590" style="s2">tradition in some kind of way like blow</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:35.010" style="s2">up blow open the doors of perception and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.590" end="00:06:36.870" style="s2">and and all that and meet meet God or</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.010" end="00:06:38.689" style="s2">whatever you want to call it the divine</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.870" end="00:06:41.409" style="s2">directly and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.689" end="00:06:43.969" style="s2">not that that&#39;s part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.409" end="00:06:46.459" style="s2">wanting to sort of storm the temple</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.969" end="00:06:49.699" style="s2">temple gates to heaven or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.459" end="00:06:54.519" style="s2">expression is is that yeah I mean look</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.699" end="00:06:58.429" style="s2">very very few mainstream humdrum</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.669" end="00:07:11.719" style="s2">dice and and interestingly I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.579" end="00:07:13.639" style="s2">you know and in fact there&#39;s this and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.719" end="00:07:15.379" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of books I&#39;d recommend</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.639" end="00:07:17.959" style="s2">for folks that want to take a scholarly</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.379" end="00:07:21.469" style="s2">but still informative take on this one</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.959" end="00:07:24.259" style="s2">is john butler&#39;s awash in a sea of faith</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.509" end="00:07:40.699" style="s2">basically eschatological revivals so</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.569" end="00:07:43.610" style="s2">like it&#39;s always the end of days and</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.870" end="00:08:52.100" style="s2">in the presence of something kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.309" end="00:08:52.460" style="s2">biblical you know just in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.100" end="00:08:54.130" style="s2">rock</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.250" end="00:09:08.900" style="s2">yeah anybody said look this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.190" end="00:09:11.390" style="s2">the closest we have and you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.900" end="00:09:13.580" style="s2">Kesey and those guys beget the Burning</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.390" end="00:09:15.710" style="s2">Man culture so it&#39;s alright yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.580" end="00:09:17.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the lineage yeah but that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.710" end="00:09:19.220" style="s2">different than corporate American isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.330" end="00:09:21.980" style="s2">it isn&#39;t it I mean corporate America</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.220" end="00:09:23.930" style="s2">takes that and uses it but but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.980" end="00:09:25.640" style="s2">kind of communist in spirit you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.930" end="00:09:27.380" style="s2">again that&#39;s kind of the paradox I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.640" end="00:09:28.970" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s like share everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.380" end="00:09:30.890" style="s2">and all this and then make all this</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.970" end="00:09:32.930" style="s2">money at the same time there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.890" end="00:09:35.900" style="s2">a there seems to be a real communist</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.930" end="00:09:37.820" style="s2">aspect to America or at least communal</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.900" end="00:09:39.170" style="s2">and unil ism yes I&#39;m saying communist</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.820" end="00:09:41.180" style="s2">which probably you know makes you think</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.170" end="00:09:43.490" style="s2">of you know messes and complications</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.180" end="00:09:46.490" style="s2">that makes you think of Marxist Leninist</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.490" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">but but but actual communalism or</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.490" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">something seems to be a big aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:54.470" style="s2">America which is again paradoxical to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:56.270" style="s2">its intense individualism or or you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.470" end="00:09:57.560" style="s2">yeah well actually that that tees up a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.270" end="00:09:58.400" style="s2">beautiful point because you asked me</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.560" end="00:10:01.580" style="s2">kind of what you know what are my</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.400" end="00:10:06.020" style="s2">thoughts on America in this kind of big</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.580" end="00:10:08.920" style="s2">picture long sense and that dialogue or</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.020" end="00:10:11.990" style="s2">dialectic right that tension between</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.920" end="00:10:14.030" style="s2">individualism and communalism is</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.990" end="00:10:15.950" style="s2">pronounced and is actually baked in so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.030" end="00:10:17.690" style="s2">not to rehash things but you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.950" end="00:10:19.160" style="s2">like how do I see what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.690" end="00:10:20.360" style="s2">America right now and we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.160" end="00:10:22.730" style="s2">the city on the hill and some of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.360" end="00:10:24.920" style="s2">things I lay this out in some detail</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.730" end="00:10:26.540" style="s2">with the guys at rebel wisdom and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.920" end="00:10:28.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a video if you want to check</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.540" end="00:10:30.500" style="s2">out war on sense-making three I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.280" end="00:10:32.360" style="s2">tee up what I think is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.500" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">biggest crisis worth at least culturally</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.360" end="00:10:37.880" style="s2">and ideologically which is the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:40.070" style="s2">to the infinite game of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:53.930" style="s2">generally decent things where we</p>

<p begin="00:11:09.260" end="00:11:14.300" style="s2">fracture break this thing up and grab</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.110" end="00:13:32.530" style="s2">thinking about your book actually and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.910" end="00:13:35.410" style="s2">was wondering if your vision had gotten</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.530" end="00:13:37.570" style="s2">darker since you wrote that book or or</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.410" end="00:13:40.120" style="s2">because it seems to have it has both</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.570" end="00:13:42.040" style="s2">those aspects it has of a utopian sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.120" end="00:13:45.750" style="s2">of aspect and it has a big respect for</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.310" end="00:13:57.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s getting again it&#39;s my same</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.230" end="00:14:00.280" style="s2">question is it getting darker is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.910" end="00:14:01.000" style="s2">getting more dangerous is it oh I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.280" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">you know like in the sense that I mean</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:27.580" style="s2">thesis of the book the only shot we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.370" end="00:15:30.290" style="s2">this time kids is to open source open</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.580" end="00:15:32.360" style="s2">sourcing right these technologies ahead</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.290" end="00:15:35.420" style="s2">of any attempts to prevent or co-opt</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.019" end="00:15:47.029" style="s2">know all these things right what we said</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.610" end="00:15:49.579" style="s2">was hey look at boners Without Borders</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.029" end="00:15:52.639" style="s2">these guys did disaster relief response</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.579" end="00:15:54.769" style="s2">they coordinated with DARPA they went to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.639" end="00:15:56.569" style="s2">Hurricane Katrina and volcanoes in South</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.769" end="00:15:58.610" style="s2">America hey look at what they did in</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.610" end="00:16:03.769" style="s2">was very very specifically - this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.009" end="00:16:06.350" style="s2">your proofing okay I guess that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.769" end="00:16:08.660" style="s2">question then is is is do you still have</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.350" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">that optimism about open sourcing or</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.660" end="00:16:12.170" style="s2">does that the source of open sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.970" style="s2">also have a very dark side of dark</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.170" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2">possibility to it it&#39;s like leaving</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.970" end="00:16:20.899" style="s2">people to their own you know leaving</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:22.339" style="s2">giving people the power has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.899" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">kind of danger as well I mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.339" end="00:16:25.639" style="s2">criticize government and you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:27.380" style="s2">criticize corporations and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.639" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">the third element would be open source</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.380" end="00:16:32.630" style="s2">would be self-organization right huh</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:35.240" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s also dangerous I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.630" end="00:16:36.920" style="s2">no isn&#39;t it I mean I mean I think I</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.240" end="00:16:39.860" style="s2">think the realities are and some smart</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.920" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">friends that I am have you know given me</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.860" end="00:16:45.800" style="s2">the kind of the maxim anything that can</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:47.540" style="s2">be weaponized will be will be right</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.800" end="00:16:50.149" style="s2">right that&#39;s what Daniel expected Berger</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.540" end="00:16:52.639" style="s2">is often saying it&#39;s yes okay can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.149" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">weaponized and it can be no but even</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.639" end="00:16:56.029" style="s2">more specifically anything that can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:16:57.980" style="s2">will be a little bit like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.029" end="00:17:00.139" style="s2">if there&#39;s some goofy law online of like</p>

<p begin="00:17:24.530" end="00:17:30.200" style="s2">we end up being responsible yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.709" end="00:17:31.549" style="s2">Yeah right it does and in fact you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.200" end="00:17:33.559" style="s2">I was thinking as recently as last night</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.549" end="00:17:36.919" style="s2">I was like oh because I mean like our</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.559" end="00:17:38.330" style="s2">our our models like what lens or what</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.919" end="00:17:39.710" style="s2">kind of like narrative and who are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.330" end="00:17:42.679" style="s2">characters and what&#39;s the basic plot</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.710" end="00:17:43.680" style="s2">that we apply to reality fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.679" end="00:17:45.540" style="s2">shapes how we see</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.680" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">and what patterns we look for what and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.540" end="00:17:49.470" style="s2">what what bubbles up and typically in</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:52.950" style="s2">the psycho-spiritual Jemaine</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.470" end="00:17:55.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the religious format there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.950" end="00:17:57.930" style="s2">priest or a teacher or a guru there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.200" end="00:17:59.190" style="s2">the word or the protocol and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.930" end="00:18:01.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of quest or an</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.190" end="00:18:03.390" style="s2">expectation or assumption of purity</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:17.460" style="s2">about his fictional soma which was based</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.810" end="00:19:19.650" style="s2">on the ancient Indian one but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.460" end="00:19:21.690" style="s2">of like the drug that sort of eases all</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.650" end="00:19:23.450" style="s2">your consumer aches and pains he said oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.690" end="00:19:26.280" style="s2">you know all the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.450" end="00:19:29.130" style="s2">Christianity and alcohol with none of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.280" end="00:19:31.590" style="s2">the side effects right so right so is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.130" end="00:19:34.020" style="s2">there the trance for Eden ization we</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.590" end="00:19:36.660" style="s2">become lizard brain fat monkeys pushing</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.020" end="00:19:39.750" style="s2">buttons you know to our nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.660" end="00:19:42.750" style="s2">100% happens all the time yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.750" end="00:19:45.090" style="s2">think a better model than the Puritan</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.750" end="00:19:47.220" style="s2">crypto puritanical religious problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.090" end="00:19:48.990" style="s2">uh-huh right where any setbacks and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.220" end="00:19:50.100" style="s2">stumbles or signs of unvalidated the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.990" end="00:19:51.870" style="s2">whole thing and they were shutters and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.100" end="00:19:53.820" style="s2">halogens charlatans and you were Dukes</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.870" end="00:19:55.480" style="s2">to follow and that kind of thing is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.820" end="00:19:59.320" style="s2">think of it more like rock climbing</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.480" end="00:20:01.420" style="s2">like this is hazardous terrain you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.320" end="00:20:03.100" style="s2">that if you wanted to stay hiking on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.420" end="00:20:05.170" style="s2">level trail stay hiking but if</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.100" end="00:20:08.980" style="s2">you want to go climbing then gravity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.170" end="00:20:12.190" style="s2">in the mix and and suddenly like when a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.980" end="00:20:14.290" style="s2">a here are best practices here&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.190" end="00:20:16.270" style="s2">use ropes and anchors safely here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.290" end="00:20:17.770" style="s2">you belay each other here&#39;s backup</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.270" end="00:20:19.330" style="s2">safety to make sure you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.770" end="00:20:21.730" style="s2">forget to do the right thing even when</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.330" end="00:20:24.490" style="s2">you try to and then if somebody decides</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.730" end="00:20:27.580" style="s2">to just go up there and clamber around</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.490" end="00:20:28.390" style="s2">drunk on the rocks and they peel off and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.580" end="00:20:31.330" style="s2">kill themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.390" end="00:20:32.710" style="s2">no one says ooh rock climbing bad we</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.330" end="00:20:33.970" style="s2">should stop this whole thing and blow up</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.710" end="00:20:35.350" style="s2">all the mountains so no one can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.970" end="00:20:37.960" style="s2">hurt themselves again they&#39;re like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.350" end="00:20:41.260" style="s2">was a dumbass who didn&#39;t know what he</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.960" end="00:20:43.510" style="s2">was doing inconsequential terrain right</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.260" end="00:20:45.460" style="s2">so there&#39;s that there&#39;s just baseline do</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.510" end="00:20:47.890" style="s2">you have the skills and the basic</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.460" end="00:20:50.260" style="s2">training to even engage the content and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.890" end="00:20:52.510" style="s2">then at the other level which is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.260" end="00:20:55.050" style="s2">masters of the game yeah that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.510" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">was gonna ask you about teachers yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.050" end="00:21:00.010" style="s2">responsible and and and yeah we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:02.470" style="s2">responsible we also need teachers right</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.010" end="00:21:05.220" style="s2">yeah so so think about Eddie Aikau write</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.470" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">that the famous Hawaiian Waterman</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.220" end="00:21:10.150" style="s2">lifeguard surfer and Quicksilver has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:13.030" style="s2">huge Eddie Aikau classic Invitational</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.150" end="00:21:14.500" style="s2">taunt you know contest at pipeline there</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.030" end="00:21:16.690" style="s2">are Quicksilver bumper stickers on lots</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.500" end="00:21:18.580" style="s2">of cars that say Eddie would go right</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.690" end="00:21:20.350" style="s2">and because what he did right there was</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.580" end="00:21:21.820" style="s2">a huge storm it was that kontiki that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.350" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">rough that they actually built back in</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.820" end="00:21:25.150" style="s2">the 70s was on that Geo on the cover</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:27.820" style="s2">right that was tore hide all that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.150" end="00:21:30.910" style="s2">Scandinavian who built the rough to try</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.820" end="00:21:32.920" style="s2">and recreate the Pacific Islanders</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.910" end="00:21:34.270" style="s2">navigating by stars and sailing to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.920" end="00:21:36.070" style="s2">Hawaiian Islands it was a big deal back</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.270" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">in the day and they got up shits Creek</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.070" end="00:21:40.180" style="s2">in the in the channel I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:42.100" style="s2">between what is it is Molokai Channel so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.180" end="00:21:43.870" style="s2">gnarly gnarly ocean Channel and Eddy</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.100" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">paddle out on his surfboard as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.870" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">lifeguard to go find them and he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:52.120" style="s2">never heard from again hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:53.740" style="s2">and and this end you know Alex Lowe who</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.120" end="00:21:56.530" style="s2">was basically the Michael Jordan of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.740" end="00:21:58.690" style="s2">Alban Alpine mountaineering the year</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.530" end="00:22:00.310" style="s2">before we were in in Tibet on Everest up</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.690" end="00:22:02.560" style="s2">go actually the year after got clipped</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.310" end="00:22:05.710" style="s2">on shishapangma by an avalanche the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.560" end="00:22:07.720" style="s2">Cutlass 3,000 meters above him and wiped</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.710" end="00:22:09.100" style="s2">out him and left his climbing partner</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.720" end="00:22:12.070" style="s2">Conrad Anker</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.100" end="00:22:13.809" style="s2">when those things happen you don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.070" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">oh they were stupid they were</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.809" end="00:22:19.539" style="s2">selfish they were fakes yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:22.090" style="s2">they went down in the line of exploring</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.539" end="00:22:25.660" style="s2">high consequence terrain it&#39;s a hat tip</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.090" end="00:22:27.340" style="s2">to a fallen warrior yeah saying he knew</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.660" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">the odds he was doing everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.340" end="00:22:33.490" style="s2">possible to mitigate the odds and Kaali</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:35.830" style="s2">bit him in the ass for 40 on the curb</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.490" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">range yeah so to me these are</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.830" end="00:22:38.740" style="s2">high-performance people who know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:40.750" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.740" end="00:22:43.690" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very much different than</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.750" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">toasting a lot of people with acid and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.690" end="00:22:49.450" style="s2">Grateful Dead concert or whatever I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:50.950" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s there do we draw the line I</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.450" end="00:22:54.010" style="s2">mean where do we draw the line in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.950" end="00:22:57.909" style="s2">business well which line which one I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.010" end="00:23:03.580" style="s2">mean let&#39;s say recreational psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.909" end="00:23:04.929" style="s2">and and and you know at this point I</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.580" end="00:23:07.539" style="s2">would I was I wouldn&#39;t take recreational</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.929" end="00:23:09.490" style="s2">psychedelics myself personally but I but</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.539" end="00:23:11.380" style="s2">but I I would say that if there was some</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.490" end="00:23:14.260" style="s2">kind of journey some kind of process</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.380" end="00:23:15.370" style="s2">some kind of you know stages and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.260" end="00:23:16.750" style="s2">kind of thing then it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.370" end="00:23:20.710" style="s2">legitimate it could be a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.750" end="00:23:22.780" style="s2">practice that&#39;s how I see it yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.710" end="00:23:25.270" style="s2">I mean if you want to get that granular</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.780" end="00:23:27.640" style="s2">yeah I mean my sense would be is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.270" end="00:23:32.110" style="s2">putting them back into cultural context</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.640" end="00:23:35.620" style="s2">is helpful recreational is arguably the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.110" end="00:23:37.419" style="s2">least interesting domain or or use</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.620" end="00:23:39.900" style="s2">category I think therapeutic is</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.419" end="00:23:44.020" style="s2">potentially profound and some form of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.900" end="00:23:47.710" style="s2">initiatory or sacramental news you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.020" end="00:23:52.260" style="s2">ineffable and so what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.710" end="00:23:56.409" style="s2">like in today in America in modern world</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.260" end="00:23:57.909" style="s2">well I mean I think the most if you if</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.409" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">you really want to talk about scaling</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.909" end="00:24:01.210" style="s2">this like let&#39;s just be super disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:02.440" style="s2">here for a moment and now we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.210" end="00:24:05.140" style="s2">playing the game it like culture</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.440" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">architecture and you&#39;re like okay we</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.140" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">have loot Lodge ask gatherings in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:10.600" style="s2">megachurches all around the country</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:12.520" style="s2">mm-hmm with tons of like dudes wearing</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.600" end="00:24:14.049" style="s2">snazzy jeans and wearing earrings and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.520" end="00:24:15.309" style="s2">goatees talking about Jesus but still</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.049" end="00:24:16.470" style="s2">they&#39;re peddling it with smokes and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.309" end="00:24:18.549" style="s2">light shows and it really looks</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.470" end="00:24:20.710" style="s2">indistinguishable from an EDM or Tony</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.549" end="00:24:22.750" style="s2">Robbins concert or conference yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.710" end="00:24:25.510" style="s2">they&#39;re pushing some old</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.750" end="00:24:27.970" style="s2">doctrine yeah you know it still is still</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.510" end="00:24:29.710" style="s2">a sin to be to be to be a gay you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.970" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">and this and that the other like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.710" end="00:24:34.030" style="s2">really they&#39;re they&#39;re bringing their</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">porting in underneath all the snazzy</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.030" end="00:24:39.880" style="s2">wrapping some really outdated doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">um if we want to go head-to-head with</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.880" end="00:24:43.810" style="s2">that that&#39;s right you say that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:45.070" style="s2">the test case how do you become the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.810" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">megachurch disrupter</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.070" end="00:24:50.890" style="s2">my sense is effectively you do Sai mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:52.540" style="s2">just may get several steps ahead of your</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.890" end="00:24:55.330" style="s2">comfort zone but I&#39;ll just lay it all</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.540" end="00:25:00.130" style="s2">out we can riff on which is what would</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.330" end="00:25:02.890" style="s2">basically a psychedelic yokes yogic</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.130" end="00:25:04.360" style="s2">flashmob what would it look like and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.890" end="00:25:07.300" style="s2">imagine you have a web you have a</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.270" end="00:33:44.630" style="s2">stumble on to mystical experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.040" end="00:33:46.400" style="s2">then and then later on you try to figure</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.100" end="00:33:52.850" style="s2">right cuz very few of us there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.140" end="00:33:55.430" style="s2">because there&#39;s no support system for it</p>

<p begin="00:33:55.430" end="00:33:58.550" style="s2">religions and they don&#39;t give you a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.690" end="00:34:01.730" style="s2">support system for those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.550" end="00:34:05.660" style="s2">experiences in fact they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.730" end="00:34:07.040" style="s2">afraid of them or or yeah I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.660" end="00:34:08.510" style="s2">that you know you asked what has shifted</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.040" end="00:34:09.800" style="s2">or changed since the writing is stealing</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.510" end="00:34:11.600" style="s2">fire I mean one of the things is to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.800" end="00:34:13.010" style="s2">realize at that point you know and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.600" end="00:34:16.760" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s like a two to three</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.010" end="00:34:18.860" style="s2">year lag from the conception of a book</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.760" end="00:34:21.830" style="s2">to other people actually seeing in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.860" end="00:34:24.500" style="s2">reading it and so that was you know 2014</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.830" end="00:34:26.120" style="s2">2015 was the origination of that like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.500" end="00:34:28.040" style="s2">think this is happening it&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.120" end="00:34:30.679" style="s2">happen and there seems to be a there</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.040" end="00:34:33.830" style="s2">there to this collective distributed</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.679" end="00:34:37.010" style="s2">revolution since then what we&#39;ve seen is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.830" end="00:34:39.740" style="s2">a basically a Children&#39;s Crusade a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.010" end="00:34:42.169" style="s2">of under informed people with poor sense</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.909" end="00:34:51.560" style="s2">effectively like everybody&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.740" end="00:34:55.240" style="s2">build a spaceship in their driveway you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.560" end="00:34:57.620" style="s2">know and so discernment meta structures</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.240" end="00:34:59.300" style="s2">academic information understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.620" end="00:35:02.810" style="s2">lineage traditions you know post</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.300" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">conventional discernment and clarity and</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:10.520" style="s2">equations most folks are there just like</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.690" end="00:35:12.110" style="s2">learners would Amazon I said an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.520" end="00:35:13.550" style="s2">time and now I&#39;m gonna quit my job but</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.110" end="00:35:15.410" style="s2">now I&#39;m gonna host a podcast and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.550" end="00:35:20.170" style="s2">like mmm yeah that&#39;s probably not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.410" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">cut it and so there is a real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.170" end="00:35:24.620" style="s2">you know if we want to do it yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:25.500" style="s2">madness kind of well yeah but on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.620" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">flip side</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.500" end="00:35:30.150" style="s2">to be back into empowering like this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:31.970" style="s2">on us yeah what is an open-source</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.150" end="00:35:34.230" style="s2">operating system so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.970" end="00:35:36.840" style="s2">psycho-spiritual equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.230" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">blockchain mm-hmm right so we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.840" end="00:35:39.840" style="s2">that with economics and governance and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:41.400" style="s2">organization but what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.840" end="00:35:43.740" style="s2">psycho-spiritual version of blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.400" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">or Linux right so it&#39;s an open-source</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.740" end="00:35:49.109" style="s2">code you can use it for free you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:51.030" style="s2">modify it you can mutate it you know and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.109" end="00:35:52.830" style="s2">it will continue to grow if it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.030" end="00:35:54.330" style="s2">and so we kind of realized that you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.830" end="00:35:57.180" style="s2">if you wanted to like if you did like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.330" end="00:35:59.160" style="s2">design thinking approach to rebooting</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.180" end="00:36:00.630" style="s2">meaning you know meaning to point out</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.160" end="00:36:02.070" style="s2">like if meaning 1.0 was organized</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.630" end="00:36:03.900" style="s2">religion and that&#39;s kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.070" end="00:36:05.730" style="s2">collapsing all over the place and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.900" end="00:36:07.140" style="s2">could even say that the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.730" end="00:36:09.510" style="s2">neoliberal consumer free-market</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.140" end="00:36:09.900" style="s2">capitalism is also collapsing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.510" end="00:36:13.369" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:16.950" style="s2">but nonetheless the old the old gods are</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.369" end="00:36:19.859" style="s2">crumbling and creaking but we have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.950" end="00:36:21.990" style="s2">profound need for that healing</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.859" end="00:36:24.570" style="s2">inspiration and connection that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.990" end="00:36:26.190" style="s2">those organized institutions used to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.570" end="00:36:28.440" style="s2">offer yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.190" end="00:36:30.420" style="s2">right yeah my my friend John for vague</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.440" end="00:36:34.200" style="s2">he calls it religio like we need the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.420" end="00:36:35.190" style="s2">religio part yeah of religion and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.200" end="00:36:37.080" style="s2">know sociologists and anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.190" end="00:36:38.369" style="s2">you know people who are belong to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.080" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">communities of faith or healthier</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.369" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">wealthier happier so it does mimetic lis</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:45.780" style="s2">just as a survival mechanism about</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">believing despite what Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.780" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">Hitchens and Sam Harris might have said</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:54.210" style="s2">right believing is actually a pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:56.280" style="s2">vital rational choice yeah yeah agreed</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.210" end="00:36:57.750" style="s2">yeah right so the question is is as</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.280" end="00:36:59.160" style="s2">though all the old gods of class and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.750" end="00:37:01.560" style="s2">old institutions are shattering or</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.160" end="00:37:03.390" style="s2">mutating into other weird things the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.560" end="00:37:05.550" style="s2">question is what do we need what&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.390" end="00:37:07.080" style="s2">what&#39;s a Design Thinking toolkit so so</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.550" end="00:37:07.830" style="s2">like instead of what would Jesus do like</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.080" end="00:37:11.099" style="s2">what would I do</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.830" end="00:37:13.530" style="s2">do you know and and you think okay well</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.099" end="00:37:15.089" style="s2">you or a little idea what&#39;s the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.530" end="00:37:17.790" style="s2">is kind of like the world&#39;s most famous</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.089" end="00:37:19.619" style="s2">design firm okay and they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.790" end="00:37:22.040" style="s2">responsible for also you know billions</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.619" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">and billions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.040" end="00:37:26.760" style="s2">so yeah just bringing design thinking to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:28.290" style="s2">it right from an agnostic point of view</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.760" end="00:37:30.810" style="s2">like we don&#39;t have a dog in the fight</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.290" end="00:37:32.339" style="s2">as far as storytelling and sky gods but</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.810" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">we do care about humans</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.339" end="00:37:37.770" style="s2">waking up growing up and showing up so</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:39.269" style="s2">how do we hope that happen and my sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.770" end="00:37:41.519" style="s2">is you need a metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.269" end="00:37:44.369" style="s2">you need some way to map and model and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.519" end="00:37:46.439" style="s2">make sense of the nonsensical or post</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.369" end="00:37:48.149" style="s2">conventional so how do we do that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.439" end="00:37:50.039" style="s2">that&#39;s one we&#39;re really really bad at</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.149" end="00:37:51.749" style="s2">right now you know cuz people just leap</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.039" end="00:37:53.609" style="s2">to magical thinking or the old crutches</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.749" end="00:37:56.479" style="s2">or you-tube spirituality or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.609" end="00:37:59.519" style="s2">would be I think John various is</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.479" end="00:38:01.679" style="s2">meaningfully far along on helping people</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.519" end="00:38:03.749" style="s2">map that in a good and rigorous way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.679" end="00:38:05.159" style="s2">right so so it&#39;s stuff like that and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.749" end="00:38:06.390" style="s2">know we also have some short hands and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.159" end="00:38:08.729" style="s2">some kind of fun checklist but you also</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.390" end="00:38:11.729" style="s2">need an ethics because when you get rid</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.729" end="00:38:14.009" style="s2">of the morals binary literal thou shalt</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.729" end="00:38:15.569" style="s2">and thou shalt nots right you need</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.009" end="00:38:17.819" style="s2">something to replace it you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.569" end="00:38:19.199" style="s2">all become rone in you know like</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.819" end="00:38:21.449" style="s2">samurais without a temple</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.199" end="00:38:23.640" style="s2">those are dangerous some cultivate that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.449" end="00:38:26.189" style="s2">much power without deference to a code</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.640" end="00:38:28.919" style="s2">and so you need an ethics you need</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.189" end="00:38:31.319" style="s2">sacraments what are the actual and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.919" end="00:38:32.909" style="s2">know do you need tradition I mean do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.319" end="00:38:36.059" style="s2">need tradition I mean in your last</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.909" end="00:38:37.499" style="s2">discussion of rebel wisdom I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.059" end="00:38:39.509" style="s2">you were arguing for tradition a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.499" end="00:38:41.969" style="s2">bit like yeah you said something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.509" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">you said you know we have to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.969" end="00:38:46.739" style="s2">like cricket or something or well it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:49.079" style="s2">the idea that was the it was the it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.739" end="00:38:51.389" style="s2">riffing on this country or sportsmanship</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.079" end="00:38:53.429" style="s2">or more respect for the past and respect</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.389" end="00:38:55.979" style="s2">for tradition or respect for the human</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.429" end="00:38:57.389" style="s2">story or hmm yeah well that&#39;s up to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.979" end="00:38:59.699" style="s2">what let me just finish sharing excuse</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.389" end="00:39:01.939" style="s2">me and we can then we can comment on</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.699" end="00:39:04.739" style="s2">what are some helpful ways that it might</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.939" end="00:39:07.049" style="s2">propagate great so one sort of culture</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.739" end="00:39:09.059" style="s2">architecture judo of like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.049" end="00:39:11.549" style="s2">easiest way to get that kind of momentum</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.059" end="00:39:13.289" style="s2">happening so so you need the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.549" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">up top how do we make sense of the nfo</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.289" end="00:39:17.009" style="s2">how do we f the ineffable as Douglas</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:19.499" style="s2">Adams once said we need the ethics to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.009" end="00:39:21.689" style="s2">replace morals because to say that I no</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.499" end="00:39:23.429" style="s2">longer mom you know agree William</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.689" end="00:39:25.799" style="s2">William Blake said it right he said one</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.429" end="00:39:27.689" style="s2">law for the lion and the Ox is</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.799" end="00:39:29.909" style="s2">oppression yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.689" end="00:39:32.699" style="s2">when you cast off your you know your</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.909" end="00:39:35.099" style="s2">oxen yoke now you&#39;re like the man</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.699" end="00:39:37.979" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that the lion just gets</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.099" end="00:39:40.759" style="s2">to eat all the babies crank the low not</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.979" end="00:39:43.199" style="s2">shallow morality but but true sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.759" end="00:39:45.179" style="s2">reflected ethics yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.199" end="00:39:46.979" style="s2">then you need sacraments right with</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.179" end="00:39:48.179" style="s2">which as Michael Pollan recently said he</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.979" end="00:39:50.479" style="s2">said all we&#39;ve got these days are</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.179" end="00:39:53.250" style="s2">placebo sacraments they don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.479" end="00:39:56.760" style="s2">graduations confirmations Bar Mitzvah</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.250" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">marriage is very few of them reliably</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.760" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">transform the people between one phase</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:03.090" style="s2">of their existence to another via</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:05.730" style="s2">contact with the numinous they&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.090" end="00:40:06.150" style="s2">always wrote social productions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.730" end="00:40:08.340" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.150" end="00:40:11.880" style="s2">so what are sacraments that actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.340" end="00:40:14.609" style="s2">work and then we need some relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.880" end="00:40:18.030" style="s2">to deities some relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.609" end="00:40:20.670" style="s2">basically archetypal forms mmm doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.030" end="00:40:23.010" style="s2">have to be cowering from a superstitious</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.670" end="00:40:25.530" style="s2">sky god it can be you know like like</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.010" end="00:40:27.930" style="s2">Tibetan Buddhism right the deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.530" end="00:40:31.320" style="s2">contemplation of wrathful and benign</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.930" end="00:40:32.910" style="s2">deities you know or in the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.320" end="00:40:35.430" style="s2">tradition the veneration of the saints</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.910" end="00:40:37.380" style="s2">which are all they&#39;re similar psycho</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.430" end="00:40:40.500" style="s2">technologies which is ideally we become</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.380" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">what you behold yeah indeed so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.500" end="00:40:44.099" style="s2">interact with some of these archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:46.080" style="s2">forms that are complex and multiple</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.099" end="00:40:49.260" style="s2">multi-layered and give us insight into</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.080" end="00:40:52.650" style="s2">the human condition and ideally allow us</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.260" end="00:40:55.590" style="s2">to kind of transmute qualities from them</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.650" end="00:40:57.660" style="s2">to us mm-hmm in that contemplating in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.590" end="00:40:58.890" style="s2">that recursive loop and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.660" end="00:41:00.750" style="s2">those things then you&#39;re like oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.890" end="00:41:02.490" style="s2">the toolkit now we just get to color</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.750" end="00:41:05.570" style="s2">them in now you get extra bonus points</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.490" end="00:41:09.690" style="s2">for either coming up with a novel</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.570" end="00:41:12.839" style="s2">innovation or dusting off a lineage</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.690" end="00:41:16.470" style="s2">tradition particularly your own right</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.839" end="00:41:20.760" style="s2">and revitalizing it with the Living</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.470" end="00:41:22.230" style="s2">Light of gnostic initiation and so back</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.760" end="00:41:25.740" style="s2">to the jute now we&#39;re at the judor level</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.230" end="00:41:29.730" style="s2">which is anywhere possible I&#39;m a huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.740" end="00:41:32.580" style="s2">fan of going back dust finding the gems</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.730" end="00:41:34.980" style="s2">buried in our traditions dusting them</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.580" end="00:41:37.470" style="s2">off holding them up again and revalorisé</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.980" end="00:41:40.500" style="s2">in them because they already there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.470" end="00:41:42.780" style="s2">inertia behind them and so people they</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.500" end="00:41:44.609" style="s2">will feel truthy long but long before</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.780" end="00:41:46.770" style="s2">you&#39;ve had to do a Michael Bloomberg and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.609" end="00:41:47.700" style="s2">spend half a billion dollars trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.770" end="00:41:50.550" style="s2">get a new point across</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.700" end="00:41:53.310" style="s2">that&#39;s not sticky so so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.550" end="00:41:56.010" style="s2">like the American experiment city on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.310" end="00:41:59.700" style="s2">hill that is a moment that is a meme</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.010" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">with a ton of momentum so if there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.700" end="00:42:02.880" style="s2">think like the way Abe Lincoln did it in</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:04.579" style="s2">the way Martin Luther King did it the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.880" end="00:42:08.059" style="s2">way even Obama attempted to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.579" end="00:42:11.420" style="s2">which was in times of crisis dust off</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.059" end="00:42:13.339" style="s2">that beautiful gem of a concept and try</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.420" end="00:42:15.859" style="s2">and encourage us to double down on it</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.339" end="00:42:17.150" style="s2">you don&#39;t do the Noam Chomsky and say</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.859" end="00:42:18.709" style="s2">the American Empire is dead and it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.150" end="00:42:20.089" style="s2">always corrupt and bankrupt and we do</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.709" end="00:42:21.439" style="s2">something else and I was like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.089" end="00:42:23.269" style="s2">that&#39;s a withering critique I feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.439" end="00:42:25.189" style="s2">totally bummed out or maybe angry and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.269" end="00:42:27.499" style="s2">for reasons I don&#39;t understand but now</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.189" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">what well we need I guess you need you</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.499" end="00:42:33.880" style="s2">need mythic language you need mythos you</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:37.429" style="s2">need because it&#39;s but it&#39;s it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.880" end="00:42:39.499" style="s2">making transparent you know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.429" end="00:42:42.589" style="s2">complexity or something and and giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.499" end="00:42:45.439" style="s2">giving people a vision of something in</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.589" end="00:42:47.479" style="s2">the future or rather than just the usual</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.439" end="00:42:49.279" style="s2">kind of forensic analysis of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.479" end="00:42:51.799" style="s2">situation like you can feel it right</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.279" end="00:42:53.569" style="s2">away if it&#39;s if it&#39;s mythological know</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.799" end="00:42:55.429" style="s2">yeah exactly and I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.569" end="00:42:58.309" style="s2">Jordan Peterson you know hit such a deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.429" end="00:42:59.479" style="s2">you know deep and resonant note yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.309" end="00:43:01.189" style="s2">like what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.479" end="00:43:02.900" style="s2">finding your father at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.189" end="00:43:04.609" style="s2">ocean or something like that right</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.900" end="00:43:08.059" style="s2">that&#39;s what Peterson was always speaking</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.609" end="00:43:11.380" style="s2">about that&#39;s rediscovering the living</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.059" end="00:43:14.209" style="s2">part of the tradition or or and in and</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.380" end="00:43:16.759" style="s2">you know integrating it and then going</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.209" end="00:43:18.109" style="s2">forward into the future well yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.759" end="00:43:20.209" style="s2">now to bring all these things together</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.109" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">so we talked about like the the flash</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.209" end="00:43:23.539" style="s2">hub synchronized consumption of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:26.089" style="s2">prescription pharmaceuticals in a hive</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.299" end="00:43:34.039" style="s2">is the closest I can come to what would</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.369" end="00:43:35.989" style="s2">be like instead of like the Anarchist</p>
