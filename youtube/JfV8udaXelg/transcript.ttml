<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:07.799" style="s2">I just watched the curse of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.140" end="00:00:09.929" style="s2">by Jordan Peterson and I found it</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.799" end="00:00:12.059" style="s2">brilliant I agreed with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">stuff but there&#39;s a lot of stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.059" end="00:00:16.619" style="s2">think he conflates himself that just</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:18.900" style="s2">because is how things are done in</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.619" end="00:00:19.529" style="s2">capitalism doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.529" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">and yet as an individual trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">this who&#39;s creative and trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">something out in the world this spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:33.540" style="s2">me very strongly because these are the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2">thoughts like I know how did that this</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.540" end="00:00:37.620" style="s2">is how you be successful at creativity</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">and yet I&#39;m not capable of it and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.620" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">I&#39;ve had to think myself around those</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">things which solve it for everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">so I want to talk about the whole video</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:53.250" style="s2">I also got pointed out yesterday and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.550" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">resonated that I I think we all like I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.250" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">want to say tear someone down but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:00:58.920" style="s2">not right like if someone says something</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">and there&#39;s a piece I don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.920" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the one I want to do the video</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">response up right is the piece I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">agree with rockingest sit there and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:08.549" style="s2">Herald their brilliance for the 90% it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:10.590" style="s2">the piece that sticks that&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.549" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">don&#39;t agree so I&#39;m trying to do a more</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.590" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">balanced video talks about the curse of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">creativity he says you have to be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:20.520" style="s2">smart to be creative I think you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">certain type of intelligence to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.520" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">creative all the different types of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">intelligence you can be creative in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">you have to have divergent thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:32.490" style="s2">capabilities that you have to think of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">novelty and something new that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">definition of creativity so yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">absolutely he talks about you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">fast out in front I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">being creative that&#39;s being successful</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">at being creative for instance there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">lot of innovation that happens that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:53.700" style="s2">multiple people will come up with at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">same time with Darwin and Wallace or</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.700" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">Tesla and Edison if you&#39;re in that field</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">you absolutely have to be first to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:06.350" style="s2">market if you&#39;re gonna be successful at</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">it but like Tesla&#39;s now being known for</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.350" end="00:02:11.459" style="s2">his genius that was in my opinion more</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">of a genius than Edison but Edison was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.459" end="00:02:15.810" style="s2">better business person and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:18.060" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean we got the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:20.130" style="s2">product it means that we thought the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.060" end="00:02:21.660" style="s2">best of us at this and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.130" end="00:02:23.790" style="s2">what Jordan Peterson&#39;s talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.660" end="00:02:26.430" style="s2">you need to be all of it for your idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.790" end="00:02:27.600" style="s2">to be successful and I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.430" end="00:02:30.060" style="s2">would necessarily disagree that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.600" end="00:02:32.430" style="s2">somewhat of a broken system even if he</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.060" end="00:02:36.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know the solution I kind of know</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.430" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">the solution he talks about that you if</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:39.530" style="s2">you&#39;re a creative person you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:42.150" style="s2">for aesthetic experiences and novelty</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.530" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">that you do creative endeavors you read</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.150" end="00:02:47.160" style="s2">fiction you enjoy music that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:47.700" style="s2">as someone who has realized I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.160" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">creative</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.700" end="00:02:52.140" style="s2">I&#39;m very innovative in my thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">yet the only one of those that applies</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.140" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">is reading fiction to me that is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:02:58.110" style="s2">caricature of somebody who&#39;s creative of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:02:59.670" style="s2">an artist that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.110" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">everybody is creativity falls in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.670" end="00:03:03.980" style="s2">box and I think he would I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:06.989" style="s2">he would escape that but that that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.980" end="00:03:09.239" style="s2">heavily correlated with being creative</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.989" end="00:03:13.380" style="s2">absolutely I don&#39;t understand why people</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.239" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">are you cease novelty and then it sparks</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.380" end="00:03:20.310" style="s2">novelty I can see my mundane and spark</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">novelty I can see a more formal or more</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.310" end="00:03:25.410" style="s2">function over form that&#39;s fine we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">creativity in all endeavors we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.410" end="00:03:30.180" style="s2">different people to be he&#39;s he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">says like saying everyone&#39;s creative his</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.180" end="00:03:36.060" style="s2">like saying everyone&#39;s an introvert yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.989" end="00:03:37.380" style="s2">and you are saying that like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:39.780" style="s2">saying that if you&#39;re creative you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.380" end="00:03:42.620" style="s2">these specific characteristics know</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:44.790" style="s2">they&#39;re correlated they&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.620" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">needed to be creative you can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.790" end="00:03:48.980" style="s2">creative without those high-risk</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:51.570" style="s2">high-reward strategy</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.980" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">absolutely and yet as somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.570" end="00:03:56.880" style="s2">very risk-averse that means my idea is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:58.049" style="s2">not going to get out there luckily I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.880" end="00:03:59.580" style="s2">figured out how to do it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.049" end="00:04:02.700" style="s2">isn&#39;t risky that isn&#39;t financially risky</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.580" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">it isn&#39;t and my life yeah I got brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.700" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">tumors worked out to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:11.610" style="s2">unable to what he talks it later which I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">will I&#39;ll get into and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.610" end="00:04:14.790" style="s2">high-risk high-reward strategy if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">monetizing the creativity right to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.790" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">actually monetize it to actually make a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:21.570" style="s2">living at it and that&#39;s the piece I</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:23.580" style="s2">think we need to solve together so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.570" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">we can unleash the creativity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:28.260" style="s2">humanity on humanity&#39;s problems he talks</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:29.850" style="s2">about if you build a better Mouse</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.260" end="00:04:31.020" style="s2">we somehow think the world will beat a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.850" end="00:04:32.190" style="s2">path to your door and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.020" end="00:04:35.100" style="s2">not true because you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.190" end="00:04:37.470" style="s2">do all of these things I agree which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.100" end="00:04:38.910" style="s2">why it&#39;s broken which is why the market</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.470" end="00:04:41.490" style="s2">for getting ight the best ideas out</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.910" end="00:04:44.010" style="s2">there is it the best instrument because</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.490" end="00:04:46.410" style="s2">it gets the best of the ideas that can</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.010" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">do all of these things not the best idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.410" end="00:04:49.230" style="s2">not the best mousetrap the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.750" style="s2">mousetrap that has the marketing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.230" end="00:04:52.890" style="s2">sales the customer support someone who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:04:52.890" end="00:04:57.540" style="s2">able to communicate the new idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.020" end="00:05:00.180" style="s2">mousetrap which you know itself has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.540" end="00:05:01.590" style="s2">be marketed and as somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.180" end="00:05:03.780" style="s2">working on the building the organization</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.590" end="00:05:05.160" style="s2">from an internal standpoint and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.780" end="00:05:06.780" style="s2">communication of the idea but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.160" end="00:05:09.320" style="s2">great at either of those pieces but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.780" end="00:05:11.400" style="s2">thing the mousetrap that I&#39;m creating</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.320" end="00:05:17.330" style="s2">solves all these problems for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.400" end="00:05:21.390" style="s2">so it is amazing yes but there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.330" end="00:05:23.070" style="s2">that to be he&#39;s not talking about being</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.390" end="00:05:24.510" style="s2">creative he&#39;s talking about the curse of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.070" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">creativity because you can&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.510" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">because you might not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:29.910" style="s2">monetize it so I think he knows they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:33.270" style="s2">different things he&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.910" end="00:05:34.710" style="s2">separating them in this talk we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.270" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">separate them we need to be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.710" end="00:05:39.230" style="s2">the best ideas out there he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:42.420" style="s2">how their family and friends</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.230" end="00:05:48.900" style="s2">sorry head and alarm clocks just went</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.420" end="00:05:50.910" style="s2">off um your family and friends have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.900" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">have money and believe in you and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.910" end="00:05:53.610" style="s2">they&#39;re taking a big risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:55.800" style="s2">he didn&#39;t say believe in you I put that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.610" end="00:05:57.930" style="s2">down because the truth is the more</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.800" end="00:05:59.880" style="s2">innovative your idea is another</p>
