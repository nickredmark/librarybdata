<p begin="00:00:00.079" end="00:00:05.940" style="s2">for super delegate Tuesday I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.720" end="00:00:09.290" style="s2">tell you why our governments are in no</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.940" end="00:00:11.790" style="s2">way a solution to any of our problems so</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.290" end="00:00:14.250" style="s2">regardless of who actually gets the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.790" end="00:00:15.990" style="s2">nomination let&#39;s change our world for</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.250" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">the better together ourselves instead of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.990" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">leave it up to our governments here are</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:21.750" style="s2">five reasons why our governments are in</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:25.189" style="s2">no way capable of coming up with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.750" end="00:00:29.099" style="s2">solutions to our complex problems one</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.189" end="00:00:29.609" style="s2">all of our democracies are left versus</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.099" end="00:00:33.420" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.609" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">they are very divisive they are done in</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.420" end="00:00:39.770" style="s2">a very rival risk win-lose way so even</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">if you do manage to get elected you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.770" end="00:00:43.110" style="s2">generally around fifty percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">population who didn&#39;t even vote for you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">who still represent and even are the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">people who did vote for you you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">make all of them happy it is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">be divisive not to actually come up with</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">solutions that are going to make the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">majority of people happy because you</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">can&#39;t make the majority of people happy</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">under the current system - they are if</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:08.369" style="s2">they take a very long time to implement</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:10.229" style="s2">any single solution it&#39;s designed that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.369" end="00:01:11.970" style="s2">it has to be this way they have to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">a test group they have to then roll it</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.970" end="00:01:16.650" style="s2">out into a our sorry focus group and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:19.650" style="s2">then a test group and to see is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.650" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">actually a plan that works and because</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.650" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">of number two we get to number three</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:27.090" style="s2">which is every solution they come up</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">with is extremely expensive compared to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.090" end="00:01:30.180" style="s2">what would be what a corporation would</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:31.560" style="s2">come up with or at least they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.180" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">beholden to the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.560" end="00:01:36.659" style="s2">the government&#39;s usually use more labor</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:38.790" style="s2">to come up with it and they have higher</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.659" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">wages and they take longer to implement</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">anything so because of that they come up</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">with very expensive solutions that take</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:47.549" style="s2">a really long time to implement which</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">brings us to number four they only have</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.549" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">four years to implement it and see a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">successful solution for their</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">constituents to feel it&#39;s a success so</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">that they will be reelected and so four</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:01.350" style="s2">is kind of all about it&#39;s like that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:03.270" style="s2">only have four years to implement it but</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.350" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">also that they have to make decisions to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:07.950" style="s2">be re-elected because if they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">next government is gonna come in and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.950" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">undo everything they did so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:12.430" style="s2">even permanent they spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:14.680" style="s2">and money coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.430" end="00:02:19.000" style="s2">illusions that then are undone by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.680" end="00:02:20.709" style="s2">next government and number five the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.000" end="00:02:22.840" style="s2">final reason they are in no way able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.709" end="00:02:24.219" style="s2">clump these solutions is because they</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:24.939" style="s2">don&#39;t have the information that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.219" end="00:02:27.489" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.939" end="00:02:30.370" style="s2">they don&#39;t have information that is both</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.489" end="00:02:32.019" style="s2">trustworthy and usable in all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.370" end="00:02:33.879" style="s2">areas they would need to have it in all</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.019" end="00:02:35.859" style="s2">of the data all of the scientific data</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.879" end="00:02:37.329" style="s2">the economic information that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.859" end="00:02:40.090" style="s2">psychological needs of their</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.329" end="00:02:42.129" style="s2">constituents they have to guess as to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.090" end="00:02:44.079" style="s2">what we need implement it make nobody</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.129" end="00:02:48.069" style="s2">happy take a long time and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.079" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">money to implement it so that was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.069" end="00:02:52.419" style="s2">five reasons why governments aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.459" style="s2">going to create the solutions but good</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.419" end="00:02:56.200" style="s2">news we are gonna create the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.459" end="00:02:58.719" style="s2">together because we don&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.200" end="00:03:01.150" style="s2">problems we don&#39;t need to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.719" end="00:03:02.799" style="s2">win all solution for everybody in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.150" end="00:03:05.500" style="s2">country just the people who want to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.799" end="00:03:08.049" style="s2">part of that solution we can spend less</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.500" end="00:03:09.969" style="s2">money less time coming up with them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.049" end="00:03:12.189" style="s2">it can be a little bit for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.969" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">instead of our governments whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.189" end="00:03:17.680" style="s2">do that is the crapshoot they have so on</p>
