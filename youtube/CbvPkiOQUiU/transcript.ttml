<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:05.040" style="s2">not quite sure why I felt like this was</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.890" end="00:00:08.540" style="s2">a particular thing to share but for some</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.040" end="00:00:12.509" style="s2">reason it seemed like the thing to do so</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.540" end="00:00:14.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a particular relatively poorly</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.509" end="00:00:17.310" style="s2">formed theory but is nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.610" end="00:00:19.590" style="s2">intriguing and I think meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.310" end="00:00:23.100" style="s2">useful and frankly the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.590" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have substantial mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.100" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">traction I think is part of why it might</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:30.630" style="s2">be useful to more clearly articulate it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:33.480" style="s2">and this is sometimes known as</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.630" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">generational theory it was popularized</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.480" end="00:00:42.270" style="s2">by Strauss and how about 20 years ago or</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:44.840" style="s2">so maybe 30 years and let me give you</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.270" end="00:00:47.850" style="s2">basically the sense of what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.840" end="00:00:50.129" style="s2">reasonably solid about it and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.850" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">the more speculative elements and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.129" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">maybe a bit of how and why it might</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:01:01.469" style="s2">prove well useful now so to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">we have what I would think is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.469" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">straightforward proposition and that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:09.689" style="s2">for human beings there is a distinct</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">difference between first-person</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.689" end="00:01:14.990" style="s2">experience secondhand third-hand in but</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">I&#39;ll go ahead and coin is fourth hand</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.990" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">and these kinds of experience happen</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">because we have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:27.710" style="s2">characteristic of being born and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">living for a specific amount of usually</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.710" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">continuous time and then die and so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:38.479" style="s2">that means is that we experience what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">is that we experience firsthand</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.479" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">ourselves but of course there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:46.549" style="s2">gigantic amount of history that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">part of our personal experience that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.549" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">which is the experience of people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:59.850" style="s2">are relatively contemporary to us most</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:01.170" style="s2">notably our own parents and aunts and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.850" end="00:02:04.280" style="s2">uncles their you know their parents</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:07.399" style="s2">siblings and our parents friends and our</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.280" end="00:02:11.069" style="s2">own childhood friends parents like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.399" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">generation that cohort tends to provide</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.069" end="00:02:16.500" style="s2">us with a secondhand kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:20.550" style="s2">periods so for from from my case for</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.500" end="00:02:23.070" style="s2">example I was born in 1971 so I have for</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.550" end="00:02:24.120" style="s2">example first-hand experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.070" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">Reagan years I have first-hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.120" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">experience of the Challenger disaster a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">first-hand experience obviously of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:34.980" style="s2">September 11th the rise of the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:36.210" style="s2">the invention and broad development of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.980" end="00:02:38.450" style="s2">the personal computer these are all</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.210" end="00:02:42.210" style="s2">things that I have as personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.450" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">experience and embodied personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.210" end="00:02:51.720" style="s2">experiences in significantly richer than</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">anything that can be conveyed socially</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.720" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">anything that can be conveyed</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:58.890" style="s2">linguistically so then I have very</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">limited personal experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.890" end="00:03:04.140" style="s2">Vietnam War in point of fact my mom and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:05.520" style="s2">I actually lived on an airbase in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.140" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">Thailand for about a year and a half</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.520" end="00:03:09.570" style="s2">maybe two years when I was very young so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">I have a little bit of embodied</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.570" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">experience in that piece but more</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:15.990" style="s2">fundamentally I have secondhand</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2">experience of the Vietnam War it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.990" end="00:03:20.880" style="s2">very rich and alive in the culture when</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">I was growing up and more importantly my</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.880" end="00:03:26.820" style="s2">my father served in the Air Force during</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:28.380" style="s2">the war and it played a meaningful role</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.820" end="00:03:30.570" style="s2">in his personal narrative and of course</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.380" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">many of his friends also were part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.570" end="00:03:37.170" style="s2">the war and effective everybody in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2">particular generation was affected by it</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.170" end="00:03:45.330" style="s2">in some meaningful way and so in my case</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">I have a secondhand experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.330" end="00:03:49.740" style="s2">Vietnam War I have direct personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:52.830" style="s2">first-hand experience with human beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.740" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">who were themselves deeply impacted at</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.830" end="00:03:58.890" style="s2">firsthand by the event so I have stories</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">that were human individual personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.890" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">stories and I have an embodied sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.220" end="00:04:07.350" style="s2">the consequence of those stories in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:09.180" style="s2">physical way but I wasn&#39;t there right I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.350" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t live it directly and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.180" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">difference makes a difference so then my</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:20.220" style="s2">grandfather served in World War two so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:21.960" style="s2">have World War two kind of third hand I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.220" end="00:04:24.210" style="s2">mean yes I knew my grandfather and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.960" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">spent time with him but meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.210" end="00:04:27.480" style="s2">less time that I spent with my own</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:29.880" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.480" end="00:04:33.150" style="s2">even less time with his siblings and his</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.880" end="00:04:37.530" style="s2">friends and and so my experience of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.150" end="00:04:42.030" style="s2">World War two is much more mediated</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.530" end="00:04:44.430" style="s2">through pure story I have the stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.030" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">that my my parents told me I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.430" end="00:04:48.450" style="s2">have the stories that the culture told</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.610" style="s2">me when I was growing up various</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:53.790" style="s2">official narratives around world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.610" end="00:04:55.920" style="s2">particularly movies patton and i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.790" end="00:04:59.250" style="s2">the big red one and the various John</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.920" end="00:05:02.640" style="s2">Wayne movies were commonplace they were</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.250" end="00:05:05.340" style="s2">alive we weren&#39;t that far away from or</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.640" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">to an effect I think right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.340" end="00:05:10.230" style="s2">when I was a kid we were closer to world</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:11.700" style="s2">war two than kids today or to the Reagan</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.230" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">years or something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.700" end="00:05:19.650" style="s2">so I certainly was aware of it but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:22.170" style="s2">now aware of it as as narrative and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.650" end="00:05:25.020" style="s2">even really as lived first-person</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.170" end="00:05:31.040" style="s2">narrative just very lightly mostly as</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.020" end="00:05:34.140" style="s2">the the reflected essence or even</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.040" end="00:05:37.730" style="s2">preferred interpretation of the event as</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.140" end="00:05:39.930" style="s2">it came through the filtered channels of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.730" end="00:05:42.450" style="s2">many different layers of people telling</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.930" end="00:05:44.100" style="s2">the story but nonetheless there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.450" end="00:05:47.640" style="s2">a sense of continuity of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.100" end="00:05:50.100" style="s2">it holds a reality a sense that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.640" end="00:05:53.310" style="s2">that really happened in a way that more</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.100" end="00:05:55.260" style="s2">distant past events don&#39;t so now we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.310" end="00:05:57.480" style="s2">jump back far enough let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.260" end="00:06:00.030" style="s2">American Civil War which I now have as</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.480" end="00:06:01.740" style="s2">fourth hand meaning I don&#39;t know anyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.030" end="00:06:03.960" style="s2">never have I ever met anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.740" end="00:06:07.020" style="s2">actually lived through the Civil War in</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.960" end="00:06:10.410" style="s2">fact I don&#39;t know anyone personally who</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.020" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">knew anyone who lived through the period</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.410" end="00:06:19.980" style="s2">of the 1862 in 1865 or if I do I am not</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:21.690" style="s2">aware of that fact certainly the impact</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.980" end="00:06:25.170" style="s2">of the American Civil War is now</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.690" end="00:06:30.120" style="s2">received by me and in fact effectively</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.170" end="00:06:32.790" style="s2">by everybody that I know as narrative as</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.120" end="00:06:35.880" style="s2">story and of course at this point now</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.790" end="00:06:37.860" style="s2">it&#39;s far enough away that the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.880" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">which the story is only that portion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:41.580" style="s2">the story that has been able to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:44.550" style="s2">hold itself in the retelling over a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.580" end="00:06:46.200" style="s2">while which means quite often losing an</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.550" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">enormous amount not only of the richness</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.200" end="00:06:50.490" style="s2">of first-person experience but frankly</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:52.290" style="s2">even have just really what happened we</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.490" end="00:06:57.320" style="s2">might say that it&#39;s it&#39;s transitioned</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.290" end="00:06:59.760" style="s2">into myths so first hand is experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.320" end="00:07:01.650" style="s2">second hand is secondhand third-hand we</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.760" end="00:07:04.440" style="s2">might call history and fourth hand might</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.650" end="00:07:07.200" style="s2">calm it and the difference between these</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.440" end="00:07:10.530" style="s2">kinds of ways of relating to what</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.200" end="00:07:12.420" style="s2">happened in the past I think are very</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.530" end="00:07:16.590" style="s2">meaningful for the way that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.420" end="00:07:19.050" style="s2">are able to well frankly who we are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.590" end="00:07:22.650" style="s2">kind of character the kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.050" end="00:07:26.430" style="s2">that lived through the battle of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.650" end="00:07:29.460" style="s2">stalingrad the kind of person who first</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.430" end="00:07:31.380" style="s2">person experienced endured the reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.460" end="00:07:35.190" style="s2">of the kind of crisis that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.380" end="00:07:37.110" style="s2">associated with that period of time we</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.190" end="00:07:39.060" style="s2">just can&#39;t you can&#39;t get that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.110" end="00:07:41.850" style="s2">character if you haven&#39;t had that kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.060" end="00:07:47.090" style="s2">of experience so what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.850" end="00:07:47.090" style="s2">we have these college striations of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.690" end="00:07:53.550" style="s2">kinds of experiences that are associated</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.860" end="00:07:56.370" style="s2">with the the flavors of experience that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.550" end="00:07:57.330" style="s2">are available to people who are alive at</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.370" end="00:07:59.940" style="s2">a given period of time</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.330" end="00:08:02.070" style="s2">now I don&#39;t want to over determine</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.940" end="00:08:05.190" style="s2">because obviously every distinct human</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.070" end="00:08:08.070" style="s2">being has a completely singular set of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.190" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">experiences and that&#39;s crucial and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.070" end="00:08:13.830" style="s2">irreducible so this isn&#39;t a notion that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:17.490" style="s2">we can reduce individuals to groups of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.830" end="00:08:23.400" style="s2">this sort but nonetheless the point is</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.490" end="00:08:26.610" style="s2">that when an entire generation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.400" end="00:08:31.160" style="s2">Russians have to a greater or lesser</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.610" end="00:08:35.669" style="s2">extent had first-person experience with</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.160" end="00:08:38.310" style="s2">the Eastern Front and an entire</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.669" end="00:08:40.229" style="s2">generation of Russians alive now simply</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.310" end="00:08:41.880" style="s2">have not had any possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.229" end="00:08:43.530" style="s2">experiencing anything even vaguely like</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.880" end="00:08:46.890" style="s2">it that&#39;s a difference that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.530" end="00:08:48.660" style="s2">difference all the way down and so now</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.890" end="00:08:51.510" style="s2">we get to the second major point so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.660" end="00:08:52.770" style="s2">first point I think that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.510" end="00:08:56.350" style="s2">difference between first</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.770" end="00:09:00.040" style="s2">experience secondhand experience history</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.350" end="00:09:02.380" style="s2">and mythology frankly I feel pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.040" end="00:09:05.230" style="s2">confident in I mean just the reality is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.380" end="00:09:09.460" style="s2">that the the kind of lessons and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.230" end="00:09:11.380" style="s2">kinds of wisdom and embodied wisdom that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.460" end="00:09:14.170" style="s2">are associated with having literally</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.380" end="00:09:17.310" style="s2">lived through the Civil War just are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.170" end="00:09:19.240" style="s2">present to people alive now we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.310" end="00:09:20.590" style="s2">we&#39;ve got all right and our honor</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.240" end="00:09:21.880" style="s2">associated with the kind of lives that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.590" end="00:09:23.410" style="s2">we happen to have lived in the lessons</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.880" end="00:09:26.860" style="s2">that are learned and coded in our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.410" end="00:09:28.810" style="s2">the hard way so then the next part is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.860" end="00:09:32.260" style="s2">say well what kinds of phenomena might</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.810" end="00:09:33.940" style="s2">we expect to happen as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.260" end="00:09:37.180" style="s2">this and here&#39;s where things to become</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.940" end="00:09:39.880" style="s2">more speculative men potentially more</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.180" end="00:09:41.770" style="s2">useful so for example one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.880" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">propositions is if you if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.770" end="00:09:47.020" style="s2">what happened in the 1950s and 1960s and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:52.440" style="s2">in particular we look at happened it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.020" end="00:09:57.640" style="s2">the Cuban Missile Crisis where you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.440" end="00:10:01.210" style="s2">JFK facing off with Khrushchev what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.640" end="00:10:03.430" style="s2">have there is two individuals who have</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.210" end="00:10:05.850" style="s2">very distinct first-person experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.430" end="00:10:10.900" style="s2">with the negative consequences of war</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:14.350" style="s2">both individuals were physically in</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.900" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">their bodies actually exposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.350" end="00:10:22.500" style="s2">horrors of war and so had a level a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:25.030" style="s2">capacity to I want to say empathize with</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.500" end="00:10:27.490" style="s2">but in the abstract empathize with in</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.030" end="00:10:30.760" style="s2">the abstract how bad that actually is in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.490" end="00:10:35.230" style="s2">a way that almost nobody currently alive</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.760" end="00:10:37.390" style="s2">in the Western world has and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.230" end="00:10:40.270" style="s2">they weren&#39;t alone there were lots of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.390" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">other people in their environment who</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.270" end="00:10:45.130" style="s2">shared that embodied experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:46.810" style="s2">horrors of war and so therefore even</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.130" end="00:10:51.250" style="s2">though enormous a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.810" end="00:10:53.110" style="s2">kinds of institutional and even game</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:55.180" style="s2">theoretic forces were pushing in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.110" end="00:10:56.980" style="s2">direction of conflict there was another</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.180" end="00:10:59.950" style="s2">counter pressure that was a deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.980" end="00:11:04.980" style="s2">embodied desire to avoid that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.950" end="00:11:06.250" style="s2">result that quite plausibly meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.980" end="00:11:09.580" style="s2">played a role</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.250" end="00:11:12.070" style="s2">preventing that from happening and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.580" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">might imagine that today in an</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.070" end="00:11:18.280" style="s2">environment where the choice makers</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:20.950" style="s2">don&#39;t have that embodied experience you</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.280" end="00:11:22.600" style="s2">look at the leaders of the Western world</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.950" end="00:11:24.520" style="s2">right you look at the leaders of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.600" end="00:11:26.190" style="s2">most of the most powerful world</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.520" end="00:11:28.840" style="s2">countries in the world in general</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.190" end="00:11:32.470" style="s2">effectively none of them have any direct</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.840" end="00:11:35.650" style="s2">first-hand experience with well frankly</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.470" end="00:11:36.610" style="s2">even anything meaningful any meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.650" end="00:11:38.890" style="s2">duress</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.610" end="00:11:41.490" style="s2">most of the did not even participate in</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.890" end="00:11:45.280" style="s2">the conflicts their countries did have</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.490" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">not believed that Putin was first person</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.280" end="00:11:51.940" style="s2">to the Afghan war I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:54.310" style="s2">Trump was first person to the Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.940" end="00:11:57.880" style="s2">War and you know obviously neither was</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.310" end="00:12:00.340" style="s2">meaningfully first person to or at all</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.880" end="00:12:02.740" style="s2">first person to world war two which was</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.340" end="00:12:05.080" style="s2">the last really serious systemic crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.740" end="00:12:06.280" style="s2">that either these countries faced you</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.080" end="00:12:08.650" style="s2">know the Chinese have a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.280" end="00:12:12.370" style="s2">different timeline because the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.650" end="00:12:15.490" style="s2">crises of the Cultural Revolution took</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.370" end="00:12:17.020" style="s2">place after the crisis of World War two</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.490" end="00:12:20.110" style="s2">and so you do actually have a handful</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.020" end="00:12:22.330" style="s2">not many folks who lived through that</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.110" end="00:12:23.710" style="s2">you have a much larger handful who lived</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.330" end="00:12:25.630" style="s2">through Tiananmen Square which is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.710" end="00:12:28.120" style="s2">different set of experiences and moral</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.630" end="00:12:29.640" style="s2">lessons but still you&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.120" end="00:12:32.200" style="s2">group of individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.640" end="00:12:36.060" style="s2">experientially second or third-hand to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.200" end="00:12:36.060" style="s2">anything which is truly truly</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.180" end="00:12:40.780" style="s2">existential and intense and so you might</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.830" end="00:12:42.400" style="s2">imagine that is these individuals if</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.780" end="00:12:44.589" style="s2">they were put to the test of something</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.400" end="00:12:47.339" style="s2">like the Cuban Missile Crisis they</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.589" end="00:12:49.870" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have the advantage of embodied</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.339" end="00:12:53.650" style="s2">experience telling them that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.870" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">place not to go I mean it&#39;s actually in</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.650" end="00:12:59.740" style="s2">some sense very simple if you have as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:02.470" style="s2">human as a child actually touched a hot</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.740" end="00:13:03.790" style="s2">stove you have a very deeper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.470" end="00:13:06.430" style="s2">why you don&#39;t want to touch hot stoves</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.790" end="00:13:08.920" style="s2">then if you say watched your sister</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.430" end="00:13:12.010" style="s2">touch a hot stove then if you heard your</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.920" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">sister tell don&#39;t touch a hot stove then</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.010" end="00:13:16.600" style="s2">if you you know heard from a teacher at</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:20.760" style="s2">school say don&#39;t touch hot stoves like</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.600" end="00:13:22.870" style="s2">the distance from invited experience to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.760" end="00:13:26.710" style="s2">mythology or fourth hand experience is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.870" end="00:13:28.540" style="s2">enormous and the ability of that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.710" end="00:13:32.680" style="s2">potency of that experience to shape your</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.540" end="00:13:34.450" style="s2">choices is significant so we can say</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.680" end="00:13:38.950" style="s2">that the second layer that we might we</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.450" end="00:13:40.839" style="s2">might deduce that deeply shared which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.950" end="00:13:42.820" style="s2">to say large numbers of people in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.839" end="00:13:46.150" style="s2">given point in time in a given society</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.820" end="00:13:47.980" style="s2">who share similar levels of intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.150" end="00:13:49.510" style="s2">embodied experience the specific</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.980" end="00:13:53.950" style="s2">qualities may be quite different but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.510" end="00:13:57.850" style="s2">the basic flavor of don&#39;t do that for</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.950" end="00:14:00.490" style="s2">example is relatively shared we should</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.850" end="00:14:05.260" style="s2">expect to have political and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.490" end="00:14:07.420" style="s2">sociological consequences and then the</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.420" end="00:14:11.320" style="s2">sociological consequences so then we get</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.910" end="00:14:13.420" style="s2">to the third and then by far the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.320" end="00:14:17.350" style="s2">speculative point which is you say okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.420" end="00:14:19.980" style="s2">then can we use that to to generate some</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.350" end="00:14:23.230" style="s2">expectations is there is there perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.980" end="00:14:27.180" style="s2">reason to believe that when you find</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.230" end="00:14:29.140" style="s2">yourself in a moment like now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.180" end="00:14:33.850" style="s2">effectively all of the choice makers</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.140" end="00:14:38.080" style="s2">around the world are third hand dealing</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.850" end="00:14:41.230" style="s2">with the last major of real consequences</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.080" end="00:14:44.589" style="s2">the crisis of real serious existential</p>

<p begin="00:14:46.270" end="00:14:51.209" style="s2">which is one of the things that we see</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.330" end="00:14:55.060" style="s2">in social media for example with</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.209" end="00:15:02.440" style="s2">Millennials we have no awareness of the</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.949" end="00:16:19.990" style="s2">avoids the kinds of things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.740" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">polarization and squabbling and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.410" end="00:16:36.829" style="s2">a ruthless struggle over small victories</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:38.930" style="s2">and self aggrandizement but rather</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.430" end="00:16:50.779" style="s2">and that is precisely the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:53.779" style="s2">which we have grown distant from those</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.939" end="00:17:06.650" style="s2">history books to mythology that we find</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.730" end="00:17:09.829" style="s2">ourselves vulnerable to making those bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.650" end="00:17:13.339" style="s2">choices and thereby once again finding</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.659" end="00:17:31.970" style="s2">our own behaviors it may very well be</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.289" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">that it&#39;s nothing more than a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.970" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">we can witness as we drive our car off</p>

<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:40.700" style="s2">and therefore not knowing how bad that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.190" end="00:17:44.330" style="s2">can be but perhaps we can hope that we</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.330" end="00:17:47.900" style="s2">so that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.650" end="00:17:51.050" style="s2">can find ways to more fully and more</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.900" end="00:17:53.930" style="s2">effectively build an embodied wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.050" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">that we can as a society make good</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.930" end="00:17:59.470" style="s2">choices that don&#39;t involve constantly</p>
