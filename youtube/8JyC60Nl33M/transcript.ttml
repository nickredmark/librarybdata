<p begin="00:01:35.870" end="00:01:40.040" style="s2">something like Pirates of the Caribbean</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.310" end="00:01:42.920" style="s2">where we are approached by the Disney</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.040" end="00:01:47.030" style="s2">company because the first Pirates movie</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.920" end="00:01:50.060" style="s2">did so well but it was an unexpected hit</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.030" end="00:01:53.630" style="s2">and and the Disney Company wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.060" end="00:01:56.060" style="s2">sequels but weren&#39;t exactly sure how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.630" end="00:01:57.830" style="s2">leverage the intellectual property</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.060" end="00:01:59.750" style="s2">across all the different divisions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.830" end="00:02:02.900" style="s2">the company they hadn&#39;t made very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.750" end="00:02:04.729" style="s2">money in licensing and Merchandising the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.900" end="00:02:09.080" style="s2">original pirates movie they just weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.729" end="00:02:12.379" style="s2">ready for it so our job was to figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.080" end="00:02:14.840" style="s2">out what made pirates so successful what</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.379" end="00:02:17.450" style="s2">was the mechanism in the story besides</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:21.080" style="s2">the movie stars of course that could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.450" end="00:02:23.300" style="s2">leveraged across comic books and video</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.080" end="00:02:25.430" style="s2">games and novels</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.300" end="00:02:29.450" style="s2">the things that would allow for a Disney</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.430" end="00:02:32.450" style="s2">to capitalize on the property and so our</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.450" end="00:02:34.220" style="s2">magic was really to determine the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.450" end="00:02:36.680" style="s2">essence of what made the Pirates</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.220" end="00:02:39.530" style="s2">universe special and to work with</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.680" end="00:02:43.010" style="s2">divisions like Imagineering on the theme</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.530" end="00:02:45.170" style="s2">park ride or their interactive division</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.010" end="00:02:47.990" style="s2">on the massive multiplayer online game</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.170" end="00:02:50.330" style="s2">to make sure that the essence of pirates</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.990" end="00:02:52.660" style="s2">what made that movie so much fun was</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.330" end="00:02:54.950" style="s2">infused into these different products</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.660" end="00:02:56.990" style="s2">cool I had no idea that it was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.950" end="00:02:59.390" style="s2">surprise hit because truthfully not</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.990" end="00:03:01.610" style="s2">being a Pirates fan myself I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.390" end="00:03:04.700" style="s2">really dug into it but my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.610" end="00:03:08.660" style="s2">nephew swears it&#39;s the greatest series</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.700" end="00:03:11.270" style="s2">in his lifetime and he&#39;s like wow and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.660" end="00:03:12.830" style="s2">he&#39;s like 33 34 years old right and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.270" end="00:03:14.840" style="s2">goes it&#39;s the Lord of the Rings for my</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.830" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">generations way he describes it he knows</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.840" end="00:03:19.670" style="s2">I&#39;m a Lord of the Rings fanatic so it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:21.140" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get my tire praise on you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.670" end="00:03:23.980" style="s2">the broader concept</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.140" end="00:03:26.960" style="s2">well maintaining the integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.980" end="00:03:28.580" style="s2">continuity of that rich universe as it</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.960" end="00:03:32.270" style="s2">develops into all these different</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.580" end="00:03:35.270" style="s2">spin-offs and product lines was our job</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.270" end="00:03:38.300" style="s2">and we came to appreciate it the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.270" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">way he did it is kind of this epic</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.300" end="00:03:43.520" style="s2">fantasy that deserves to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:45.020" style="s2">respected and and maintained you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.520" end="00:03:46.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of a side question but</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.020" end="00:03:49.070" style="s2">just struck me how do you keep it from</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.880" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">getting cheesy or as I say in the series</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.070" end="00:03:55.790" style="s2">TV world jumping the shark it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:59.180" style="s2">very difficult because in Hollywood the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.790" end="00:04:02.690" style="s2">visionary is still the director perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.180" end="00:04:04.670" style="s2">the the producer and and sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.690" end="00:04:07.160" style="s2">don&#39;t quite have their finger on what</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.670" end="00:04:11.000" style="s2">exactly made these movies special so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.160" end="00:04:13.730" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re allowed to kind of speak</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.000" end="00:04:16.090" style="s2">truth to power and go you know this</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.730" end="00:04:20.030" style="s2">screenplay doesn&#39;t quite nail it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.090" end="00:04:22.510" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re told to shut up and let</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.030" end="00:04:24.950" style="s2">them do it and so we have watched</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.510" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">sequels to the works that we&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.950" end="00:04:30.890" style="s2">on maybe not be quite as good as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">previous one it&#39;s part of the job yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.890" end="00:04:35.060" style="s2">well those of us would go to movies a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:36.529" style="s2">lot know that happens all the time but</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.060" end="00:04:38.239" style="s2">sometimes you get a you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.529" end="00:04:40.549" style="s2">a big surprise like I still think</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.239" end="00:04:42.499" style="s2">Terminator 2 is the greatest one in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.549" end="00:04:44.749" style="s2">Terminator sequence sorry it&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.499" end="00:04:47.269" style="s2">yeah in fact I&#39;m gonna go watch it again</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.749" end="00:04:50.569" style="s2">right before I go see the new Terminator</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.269" end="00:04:53.269" style="s2">Jim I knew you were a nerd just not this</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.569" end="00:04:57.079" style="s2">kind of nerd that&#39;s that&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.269" end="00:04:58.549" style="s2">I&#39;m basically all kinds of nerd in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.079" end="00:05:01.429" style="s2">I think I&#39;m gonna coin a new word Polly</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.549" end="00:05:05.329" style="s2">nerdish ness I&#39;m with you on the Polly</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.429" end="00:05:08.329" style="s2">nerdish ness if I did a little research</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.329" end="00:05:10.189" style="s2">before this episode one of the terms</p>

<p begin="00:05:14.659" end="00:05:22.339" style="s2">you tell us what that is that&#39;s a fancy</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.239" end="00:05:25.909" style="s2">term for you know being a nerd well</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.339" end="00:05:30.289" style="s2">think about your experience of reading</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.289" end="00:05:36.139" style="s2">often Iron Man can show up in</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.139" end="00:05:43.099" style="s2">can team up with the Fantastic Four</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.829" end="00:05:45.999" style="s2">those were were story worlds those</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.099" end="00:05:48.649" style="s2">Marvel and DC comic book universes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.999" end="00:05:51.259" style="s2">and in doing so there was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.649" end="00:05:53.509" style="s2">intertextuality there was the ability</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.259" end="00:05:56.199" style="s2">for characters to visit one another and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.509" end="00:06:00.919" style="s2">still have a kind of persistent universe</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.919" end="00:06:07.729" style="s2">this for the Godzilla movies I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.459" end="00:06:10.579" style="s2">this for Planet of the Apes and and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.729" end="00:06:12.769" style="s2">was often disappointed because the</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.769" end="00:06:17.929" style="s2">properties was done in a kind of casual</p>

<p begin="00:08:42.020" end="00:08:46.300" style="s2">thing that I turned out the most on is</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.459" end="00:09:09.649" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.029" end="00:09:12.410" style="s2">Lord of the Rings is embedded in a much</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.649" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2">larger narrative simile and etc and some</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.410" end="00:09:15.589" style="s2">other little bits and pieces and things</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.880" end="00:09:18.050" style="s2">that were never published and so he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:24.290" style="s2">consistent he in some sense he may might</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.760" end="00:09:27.860" style="s2">be more or less the father of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.290" end="00:09:30.709" style="s2">approach fairly close to it Jim I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.860" end="00:09:32.870" style="s2">actually am i started with Tolkien I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.709" end="00:09:36.050" style="s2">started with The Hobbit and The Lord of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.870" end="00:09:39.430" style="s2">the Rings and this was when I was very</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.050" end="00:09:42.459" style="s2">young but old enough to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.430" end="00:09:46.279" style="s2">everything I&#39;d read up until that moment</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.459" end="00:09:49.490" style="s2">felt like the author was just making up</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.279" end="00:09:53.570" style="s2">a story with The Hobbit and Lord of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.490" end="00:09:56.060" style="s2">Rings the richness of the characters</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.570" end="00:09:59.540" style="s2">their histories their genealogies their</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.060" end="00:10:03.560" style="s2">cultures mixed with this extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.540" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">passionate quest narrative that really</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.560" end="00:10:09.949" style="s2">can touch your heart because of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">Frodo and his fellowship suffer and pull</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.949" end="00:10:16.010" style="s2">so hard to to get this this job done</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:19.010" style="s2">that combination of things felt</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.010" end="00:10:22.519" style="s2">absolutely palpable and real to me and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.010" end="00:10:25.070" style="s2">and made me think I need to know how he</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.519" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">did this it was like a magic trick how</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.070" end="00:10:30.709" style="s2">did you convince me that this fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.740" end="00:10:33.260" style="s2">world is absolutely real as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.709" end="00:10:36.310" style="s2">experiencing it on the page and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.260" end="00:10:40.040" style="s2">started my own quest to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.310" end="00:10:42.890" style="s2">engines of narratives how story is put</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.040" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">together across the world and throughout</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.890" end="00:10:47.899" style="s2">history very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:50.060" style="s2">if narrative is seems to be the base on</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.899" end="00:10:52.190" style="s2">which you have built could you define</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.060" end="00:10:55.370" style="s2">exactly what it is you mean when you say</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.190" end="00:10:57.589" style="s2">narrative narrative the way we see it at</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.370" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">starlight Runner is slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.589" end="00:11:03.829" style="s2">from story story concerns itself with</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:06.620" style="s2">plot and theme and characters and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.829" end="00:11:10.130" style="s2">forth but narratives to us is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.620" end="00:11:13.010" style="s2">foundational structure of story these</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.130" end="00:11:16.119" style="s2">are the elements that allow for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.010" end="00:11:19.179" style="s2">story to unfold in any direction</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.119" end="00:11:22.809" style="s2">backwards or forwards through time but</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.179" end="00:11:27.519" style="s2">it also allows for the communication</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.809" end="00:11:29.470" style="s2">between the audience and story you see I</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:33.179" style="s2">already was kind of getting in touch</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.470" end="00:11:37.799" style="s2">with with the 21st century way back in</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.179" end="00:11:41.499" style="s2">1979 1980 and I came to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.799" end="00:11:43.989" style="s2">the through the internet and my early</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.499" end="00:11:47.949" style="s2">dabbling with it that the audience was</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.989" end="00:11:50.919" style="s2">going to have a role in a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.949" end="00:11:54.009" style="s2">structure that the narrative is going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.919" end="00:11:57.220" style="s2">have to acknowledge the participation of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.009" end="00:11:59.319" style="s2">the audience if it&#39;s going to survive</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.220" end="00:12:03.489" style="s2">into the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.319" end="00:12:07.659" style="s2">so narrative isn&#39;t just the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.489" end="00:12:11.079" style="s2">story how story is built it also takes</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.659" end="00:12:14.709" style="s2">into consideration the response and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.079" end="00:12:18.549" style="s2">participation of the audience</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.709" end="00:12:21.149" style="s2">so narrative is a river that we as</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.549" end="00:12:24.309" style="s2">audience members are tributaries into</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.149" end="00:12:27.309" style="s2">wow I love that I guess some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.309" end="00:12:28.389" style="s2">examples of that - Wayne as&#39; first one I</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.309" end="00:12:30.309" style="s2">remember I&#39;m sure there must been</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.389" end="00:12:33.039" style="s2">earlier ones was the whole phenomenon of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.309" end="00:12:36.609" style="s2">Trekkies and the conventions of Star</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.039" end="00:12:39.309" style="s2">Trek fans etc and how that fed back into</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.609" end="00:12:41.739" style="s2">the narrative I expect is that a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.309" end="00:12:45.069" style="s2">example of that two-way nature it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.739" end="00:12:47.409" style="s2">absolutely a great example and a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.069" end="00:12:50.769" style="s2">foundational example I mean before Star</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.409" end="00:12:52.869" style="s2">Trek we bought our Lone Ranger decoder</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.769" end="00:12:54.789" style="s2">rings I mean maybe not me personally</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.869" end="00:12:59.470" style="s2">that is even a little bit before my time</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.789" end="00:13:02.829" style="s2">we could dress up as the shadow but with</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.470" end="00:13:06.059" style="s2">with Star Trek there was so little of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.829" end="00:13:10.889" style="s2">right and and we were so in love with it</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.059" end="00:13:14.139" style="s2">that we began to to manufacture content</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.889" end="00:13:17.799" style="s2">around it and mail it to it to one</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.139" end="00:13:19.659" style="s2">another in through snail mail so these</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.799" end="00:13:23.349" style="s2">are that&#39;s this is the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.659" end="00:13:26.949" style="s2">fanfic or fan fiction and and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.349" end="00:13:29.540" style="s2">these networks of fans who who somehow</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.949" end="00:13:31.459" style="s2">got in touch with one another</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.540" end="00:13:34.490" style="s2">somehow recognized that that we were</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.459" end="00:13:36.410" style="s2">scattered across the United States began</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.490" end="00:13:38.300" style="s2">to say you know what why don&#39;t we kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.410" end="00:13:40.940" style="s2">of gather together to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.300" end="00:13:44.570" style="s2">and and those initials Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.940" end="00:13:48.110" style="s2">conventions in the very early 1970s were</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.570" end="00:13:51.230" style="s2">the result and and that birth that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.110" end="00:13:55.519" style="s2">first fandom but also kind of the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.230" end="00:13:57.769" style="s2">truly transmedia effort perfect I still</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.519" end="00:13:59.690" style="s2">remember how pissed off I was when they</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.769" end="00:14:02.209" style="s2">cancelled Star Trek I go what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.690" end="00:14:08.750" style="s2">the only TV show that&#39;s actually worth</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.209" end="00:14:10.610" style="s2">watching and they can&#39;t what of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.750" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">you know because it was the first you</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.610" end="00:14:14.779" style="s2">know there was no Jeff Gomez around in</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:17.420" style="s2">those days and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read some</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.779" end="00:14:19.630" style="s2">of the Star Trek spin-off novels and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.420" end="00:14:21.490" style="s2">stuff some of them really socked right</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.490" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">but the maintenance of that passion</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.740" end="00:14:33.589" style="s2">allowed for Star Trek to survive you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:37.940" style="s2">know six or seven very lonely years in</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.589" end="00:14:41.209" style="s2">the wilderness until Star Wars ignited</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.940" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">this fan interest in cosmic space movies</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.209" end="00:14:47.930" style="s2">and Star Wars of course was the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:51.079" style="s2">but you better believe Paramount</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.930" end="00:14:53.620" style="s2">Pictures ran into the studio and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.079" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">started shooting a Star Trek movie</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.620" end="00:14:59.769" style="s2">to bring that back it wouldn&#39;t have done</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.529" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">the sky they did that once in a while -</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.480" end="00:16:36.470" style="s2">it really really helped to to set my</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:40.339" style="s2">frame of mind Star Wars was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.470" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">influential - but it&#39;s its simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.339" end="00:16:46.850" style="s2">and it&#39;s the the polarity of the</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.850" end="00:16:52.630" style="s2">sort of thing as I grew older it it grew</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.380" end="00:20:35.780" style="s2">that I reviewed before the show is a</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.630" end="00:20:56.770" style="s2">I am with collective journey and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.070" end="00:21:00.980" style="s2">it&#39;s something that&#39;s so exciting for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.770" end="00:21:02.780" style="s2">back in the in the 1990s I was a video</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.980" end="00:21:06.980" style="s2">game developer I had developed some</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.780" end="00:21:08.630" style="s2">Nintendo 64 video games and a company</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.980" end="00:21:11.420" style="s2">called acclaim entertainment approached</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.630" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">me about building a massively</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.420" end="00:21:18.410" style="s2">multiplayer online game this was early</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:20.270" style="s2">in that format and and so there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.410" end="00:21:23.450" style="s2">all that much to compare it to there was</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.270" end="00:21:24.710" style="s2">ultimately know if you remember Ultima I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.450" end="00:21:30.650" style="s2">probably still have an account on that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.710" end="00:21:35.210" style="s2">yeah EverQuest Ultima all those are yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.650" end="00:21:37.370" style="s2">sure so I looked at at those games I had</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.210" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">not been a part of that I did Dungeons &amp;</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.370" end="00:21:42.740" style="s2">Dragons so so we were telling stories</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:45.080" style="s2">around the table there were tangible</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.740" end="00:21:48.560" style="s2">little miniatures that you could move</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.080" end="00:21:52.130" style="s2">about and and you can engage in in kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.560" end="00:21:54.860" style="s2">of dramatic storytelling face to face</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.130" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">and and there was an emotional component</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.860" end="00:22:01.550" style="s2">to tabletop gaming that I found missing</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:05.510" style="s2">when when I went into the worlds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.550" end="00:22:08.270" style="s2">Ultima and EverQuest in fact I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.510" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">that pretty soon after I showed up in</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.270" end="00:22:14.370" style="s2">those worlds I&#39;d get myself killed</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:18.660" style="s2">you know and and I noticed that that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.370" end="00:22:21.390" style="s2">a fairly pervasive problem so here you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.660" end="00:22:26.130" style="s2">are in a situation where there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.390" end="00:22:29.820" style="s2">opportunity to tell a massive collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.130" end="00:22:33.480" style="s2">narrative where each participant could</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.820" end="00:22:37.710" style="s2">somehow count for for moving the story</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.480" end="00:22:41.100" style="s2">of this world law but what we were stuck</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.710" end="00:22:43.080" style="s2">with due to all kinds of limitations but</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.100" end="00:22:47.700" style="s2">I think predominantly a limitation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.080" end="00:22:49.799" style="s2">imagination is the is the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.700" end="00:22:52.620" style="s2">were basically going to this fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.799" end="00:22:55.020" style="s2">world to be a member of the audience if</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.620" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">you didn&#39;t get instantly killed all</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.020" end="00:22:58.440" style="s2">you&#39;re really doing is kind of walking</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:01.230" style="s2">around looking at things and hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.440" end="00:23:03.450" style="s2">you can I don&#39;t know slaughter a monster</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.230" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">or something like that every once in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.450" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">long while a generation treasure it just</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:14.850" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that satisfying it was a movie in</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:17.160" style="s2">which we were all extras and and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.850" end="00:23:20.730" style="s2">started to think about what what if</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.160" end="00:23:23.929" style="s2">there were a way for for everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.730" end="00:23:26.160" style="s2">have a rich story who was in that world</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.929" end="00:23:28.380" style="s2">something that was meaningful and had</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.160" end="00:23:30.840" style="s2">some kind of impact in that world well I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.380" end="00:23:32.669" style="s2">suggested this with some documentation</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.840" end="00:23:38.130" style="s2">to acclaim entertainment and they told</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.669" end="00:23:40.470" style="s2">me to go away because of course to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.130" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">that would have been to flip the table</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.470" end="00:23:46.530" style="s2">upside down and start from scratch and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:47.970" style="s2">create an entirely new format for gaming</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.530" end="00:23:50.340" style="s2">they weren&#39;t prepared to do that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.970" end="00:23:53.309" style="s2">just wanted to do their ultimate game</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.340" end="00:23:55.950" style="s2">that by the way never manifested after I</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.309" end="00:23:59.040" style="s2">left it eventually shut down but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.950" end="00:24:02.429" style="s2">thought about that for a long time then</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.040" end="00:24:07.410" style="s2">as the years progressed and and I began</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.429" end="00:24:10.950" style="s2">to notice how the internet was giving</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.410" end="00:24:14.280" style="s2">fans a voice right so first in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.950" end="00:24:16.740" style="s2">if you had some kind of genre property</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.280" end="00:24:19.140" style="s2">there was going to be fans to complain</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.740" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">about it and fans to adore it and fans</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.140" end="00:24:24.059" style="s2">to argue over every aspect of it right</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:26.129" style="s2">there was the bronze</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.059" end="00:24:29.789" style="s2">Buffy the Vampire Slayer leave these</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.009" end="00:24:40.859" style="s2">I was a part of a comic book company and</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.920" end="00:27:12.920" style="s2">there was a kind of Hollywood ization of</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.920" end="00:27:19.670" style="s2">got more and more uncomfortable with</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.800" end="00:27:55.640" style="s2">the role of story and if we adhere to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.750" end="00:27:59.690" style="s2">that that&#39;s fine until Hollywood becomes</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.640" end="00:28:03.260" style="s2">the epicenter of story then Hollywood&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.690" end="00:28:06.800" style="s2">version of right and wrong Hollywood&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.590" end="00:28:46.400" style="s2">that certain very narrow depictions of</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.529" end="00:31:45.610" style="s2">yeah Jordan and I go way back right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:48.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve been co-conspirators and all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.610" end="00:31:50.890" style="s2">of crazy stuff over the years so now it</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.700" end="00:31:54.940" style="s2">all ties together see it this it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.890" end="00:31:58.330" style="s2">a transmedia a story right now Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.940" end="00:32:01.539" style="s2">was in the audience at MIT when I first</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.330" end="00:32:03.909" style="s2">was talking about the efficacy of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.539" end="00:32:06.970" style="s2">participative narrative and transmedia</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.909" end="00:32:10.929" style="s2">storytelling and he was fascinated with</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.970" end="00:32:13.049" style="s2">it and wrote me and and we began this</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.929" end="00:32:17.500" style="s2">correspondence and we eventually became</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.049" end="00:32:20.610" style="s2">tremendous friends and and he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.500" end="00:32:23.529" style="s2">helped me to start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.610" end="00:32:27.059" style="s2">applications of transmedia outside of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.529" end="00:32:30.220" style="s2">the conventional kind of nerd space and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.059" end="00:32:33.010" style="s2">and he was the one who had mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.220" end="00:32:35.980" style="s2">as a a possible application in</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.010" end="00:32:38.710" style="s2">geopolitical situations of course the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.980" end="00:32:42.100" style="s2">first instinct for the government about</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.710" end="00:32:44.529" style="s2">that was to weaponize it and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.100" end="00:32:47.529" style="s2">I was confronted with which was very a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.529" end="00:32:50.289" style="s2">very sobering situation you know could</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.529" end="00:32:52.840" style="s2">you imagine I&#39;m Here I am playing with</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.289" end="00:32:55.059" style="s2">transmedia storytelling and creating</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.840" end="00:32:57.429" style="s2">entertainment with it and these guys are</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.059" end="00:33:01.450" style="s2">saying well can transmedia be used in</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.429" end="00:33:04.659" style="s2">the theater of combat and my response</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.450" end="00:33:07.750" style="s2">actually Jim was that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.659" end="00:33:11.679" style="s2">particularly interested in pursuing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.750" end="00:33:14.160" style="s2">because in order to weaponize transmedia</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.679" end="00:33:16.800" style="s2">storytelling you needed to remove</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.160" end="00:33:21.180" style="s2">the component that made it transmedia</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.800" end="00:33:24.930" style="s2">which or special which was authentic</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.180" end="00:33:27.690" style="s2">dialogue a transparency and when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.930" end="00:33:30.990" style="s2">remove that you get super propaganda you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.690" end="00:33:34.590" style="s2">get multilateral narrative which could</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.990" end="00:33:37.130" style="s2">be used to ferment chaos and create</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.590" end="00:33:39.870" style="s2">confusion amongst a population and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.130" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t interest me at all</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.870" end="00:33:45.290" style="s2">in fact I&#39;d been observing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:48.360" style="s2">methodology in Russia at the time and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.290" end="00:33:53.730" style="s2">thought that it was actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.360" end="00:33:57.330" style="s2">frightening to use story to confuse and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.730" end="00:34:01.280" style="s2">antagonize and exhaust an entire nation</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.330" end="00:34:06.020" style="s2">of people so that you could assert</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.280" end="00:34:09.540" style="s2">authoritarianism over them so I said no</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.020" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">I&#39;m not interested and I said however I</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.540" end="00:34:15.659" style="s2">do believe that you can use authentic</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:18.510" style="s2">transmedia storytelling to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.659" end="00:34:22.440" style="s2">organize themselves better and to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.510" end="00:34:25.850" style="s2">progressive positive issues in a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.440" end="00:34:29.730" style="s2">that could generate a significant</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.850" end="00:34:35.580" style="s2">positive results and they said well</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.730" end="00:34:39.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll pay you a lot less but let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.580" end="00:34:42.450" style="s2">look into that shall we and and we did</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.000" end="00:34:46.200" style="s2">an experiment in Afghanistan that</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.450" end="00:34:49.409" style="s2">resulted in tapping into these these</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.200" end="00:34:53.179" style="s2">towns in in Afghanistan tapping into an</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.409" end="00:34:56.149" style="s2">ancient mythic kind of tradition where</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.179" end="00:34:59.000" style="s2">if a stranger crosses into the town</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.149" end="00:35:01.710" style="s2">they&#39;re protected no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.000" end="00:35:04.350" style="s2">collectively the whole town has to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.710" end="00:35:06.630" style="s2">together and stand up for that person so</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.350" end="00:35:11.420" style="s2">so that person is safe so long as they</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.630" end="00:35:15.960" style="s2">are in the town and that actually saved</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.420" end="00:35:18.390" style="s2">some soldiers lives in Afghanistan there</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.960" end="00:35:20.070" style="s2">was a Mark Wahlberg movie where where</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.390" end="00:35:22.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a sequence where that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.070" end="00:35:25.230" style="s2">actually happened it was a depiction of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.440" end="00:35:26.810" style="s2">an actual event so that was successful</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.230" end="00:35:30.170" style="s2">and so we begin</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.810" end="00:35:33.310" style="s2">working with the DoD and United States</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.170" end="00:35:36.680" style="s2">Special Operations Command and and other</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.310" end="00:35:40.910" style="s2">branches of intelligence - and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.680" end="00:35:43.970" style="s2">military - to promote transmedia</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.910" end="00:35:46.370" style="s2">population activation elsewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.970" end="00:35:48.920" style="s2">world interesting that&#39;s I&#39;m gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.370" end="00:35:50.630" style="s2">back to this and talk about Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.920" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">some of the things he and I worked on</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.630" end="00:35:55.490" style="s2">etc but I&#39;m gonna pick up on the line</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:56.990" style="s2">you just said about seeing what was</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.490" end="00:35:59.060" style="s2">going on in Russia you know you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.990" end="00:36:01.460" style="s2">good guy but you know what about bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.060" end="00:36:03.500" style="s2">guys using these same techniques how</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.460" end="00:36:05.840" style="s2">would you suggest that people become</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.500" end="00:36:07.580" style="s2">aware that these techniques exist and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.840" end="00:36:09.170" style="s2">can be used for evil and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.580" end="00:36:12.410" style="s2">detect them and how do we fight against</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.170" end="00:36:15.050" style="s2">them that&#39;s been really one of my major</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.410" end="00:36:17.800" style="s2">concerns over the past a few years</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.050" end="00:36:22.040" style="s2">because I&#39;m extremely concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.800" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">the fact that techniques that were once</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.040" end="00:36:29.870" style="s2">used to to generate joy and to to foment</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:32.470" style="s2">a community fan communities and things</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.870" end="00:36:36.770" style="s2">like that in some ways have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.470" end="00:36:40.040" style="s2">corrupted and turned into scenarios that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.770" end="00:36:44.200" style="s2">are promoting extremism internal</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.040" end="00:36:48.920" style="s2">conflict strife dividing and conquering</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.200" end="00:36:51.650" style="s2">entire peoples and I think it&#39;s vital</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.920" end="00:36:55.390" style="s2">that we recognize this what we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.650" end="00:36:58.090" style="s2">look for essentially is inauthentic</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.390" end="00:37:03.590" style="s2">communication that&#39;s the bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.090" end="00:37:06.470" style="s2">if story is coming at us in a fast and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.590" end="00:37:10.070" style="s2">furious way from a single source and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.470" end="00:37:11.980" style="s2">those stories have traits like like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.070" end="00:37:14.390" style="s2">fact that they can contradict themselves</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.980" end="00:37:20.360" style="s2">sometimes between morning noon and night</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.390" end="00:37:23.650" style="s2">or they are divisive if they&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.360" end="00:37:29.090" style="s2">negative if they&#39;re attacking if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.650" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">laying claim to our darker impulses then</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.090" end="00:37:36.070" style="s2">we would know that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">inauthentic behind their application</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.070" end="00:37:42.210" style="s2">it&#39;s just not the way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:45.910" style="s2">promote unity and a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.210" end="00:37:48.430" style="s2">direction for society it&#39;s easy to say</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.910" end="00:37:52.350" style="s2">that it&#39;s much more difficult to sell</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.430" end="00:37:56.020" style="s2">tell somebody who&#39;s reacting to it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.350" end="00:37:58.180" style="s2">lost in it and and actually is enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.020" end="00:38:00.610" style="s2">it it&#39;s hard to tell that person you</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.180" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">know you&#39;re being gassed slighted or</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.610" end="00:38:05.980" style="s2">you&#39;re allowing yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:08.260" style="s2">manipulated by false memes and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.980" end="00:38:10.360" style="s2">invasion of divisive narratives</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.260" end="00:38:11.830" style="s2">fortunately and and unfortunately I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.360" end="00:38:14.140" style="s2">your whole career is based on it right</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.830" end="00:38:15.490" style="s2">we are suckers for narrative probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.140" end="00:38:18.400" style="s2">going back to sitting around the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.490" end="00:38:20.680" style="s2">campfire in hunter-gatherer bands and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:23.110" style="s2">various people took their turns either</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.680" end="00:38:25.630" style="s2">telling news stories or probably telling</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.110" end="00:38:26.920" style="s2">the old classics with a few twists and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.630" end="00:38:29.170" style="s2">spins that have been passed down through</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.920" end="00:38:31.510" style="s2">the generations for a thousand years and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.170" end="00:38:34.570" style="s2">so you know that&#39;s been a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.510" end="00:38:37.390" style="s2">our conviviality at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.570" end="00:38:39.100" style="s2">small bands of humans and so we are good</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.390" end="00:38:40.900" style="s2">at that we like that we&#39;re suckers for</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.100" end="00:38:42.280" style="s2">it and so it can indeed be weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.900" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">you know you know you&#39;re describing all</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.280" end="00:38:46.630" style="s2">these attributes two examples came to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">mind like to get your reactions to both</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.630" end="00:38:49.390" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:52.450" style="s2">the first and perhaps the purest example</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.390" end="00:38:54.130" style="s2">I would call the ban and Trump narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.450" end="00:38:59.920" style="s2">they talked to me about that a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.130" end="00:39:03.870" style="s2">bit well it&#39;s chaos as a ladder in the</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.740" end="00:39:13.510" style="s2">a failed science fiction author who was</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.140" end="00:39:17.140" style="s2">in the advertising industry he visited</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.500" end="00:39:43.170" style="s2">flickering you and it was bombarding you</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.230" end="00:39:46.300" style="s2">with a very provocative imagery</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.850" end="00:40:17.230" style="s2">that was fascinating and he went back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.760" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">the Russian Kremlin and said you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.230" end="00:40:24.460" style="s2">you know we can use this you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:27.700" style="s2">in a situation where glass gnost</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.460" end="00:40:29.320" style="s2">is failing where the Russian economy is</p>

<p begin="00:40:39.940" end="00:40:46.630" style="s2">can kind of freak out our own citizenry</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.390" end="00:40:48.730" style="s2">and then assert an overriding theme that</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.730" end="00:40:54.850" style="s2">we&#39;re going to take care of things and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.300" end="00:40:58.780" style="s2">Jim here was the pattern see if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.850" end="00:41:01.960" style="s2">recognize it these narratives began to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.780" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">be communicated across Russian media and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.960" end="00:41:06.460" style="s2">of course because there is such a grasp</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:08.620" style="s2">on on Russian media by the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.460" end="00:41:13.860" style="s2">government it was a little easier even</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.620" end="00:41:16.870" style="s2">than here but these kind of strange</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.860" end="00:41:19.750" style="s2">contradictory narratives began to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.870" end="00:41:23.620" style="s2">dispersed across Russia and at first</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.750" end="00:41:26.230" style="s2">they seemed obviously fake it seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.620" end="00:41:29.170" style="s2">the average Russian person that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.230" end="00:41:31.630" style="s2">Kremlin were a bunch of clowns that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.170" end="00:41:36.430" style="s2">they were behaving in bizarre and silly</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.630" end="00:41:40.390" style="s2">ways then circle hired groups or</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.430" end="00:41:44.530" style="s2">fermented fermented anti-muslim groups</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.390" end="00:41:46.600" style="s2">to be on the rise anneal fascists and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.530" end="00:41:49.420" style="s2">things like that sometimes in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.600" end="00:41:52.600" style="s2">actually allowed for them to clash in</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.420" end="00:41:54.970" style="s2">the streets until the Russian police</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.600" end="00:41:57.760" style="s2">forces descended on them and brought</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.970" end="00:41:59.850" style="s2">them under control this seemed bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.760" end="00:42:04.030" style="s2">and frightening to the Russian people</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.850" end="00:42:06.710" style="s2">then the attitudes about the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.030" end="00:42:09.950" style="s2">freedom or restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.710" end="00:42:14.140" style="s2">it can we practice Orthodox Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.950" end="00:42:18.080" style="s2">or Capri can we not all of these crazy</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.140" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">contradictory stories were bombarding</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.080" end="00:42:23.240" style="s2">the Russian people so yeah at first they</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:28.280" style="s2">laughed but then they got angry and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.240" end="00:42:31.250" style="s2">they got exhausted and then within five</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.280" end="00:42:32.380" style="s2">or six years they said you know what we</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.250" end="00:42:35.390" style="s2">give up</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.380" end="00:42:38.180" style="s2">just just manage it just take care of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.390" end="00:42:43.070" style="s2">we we&#39;re withdrawing from this</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.180" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">conversation and Putin affirmed his</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.070" end="00:42:50.600" style="s2">grasped the oligarchical Network settled</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:54.260" style="s2">into power and Steve baton was studying</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.600" end="00:42:57.830" style="s2">every step of this he he was a student</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.260" end="00:43:00.890" style="s2">in essence of Surkov this is something</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.830" end="00:43:05.600" style="s2">that worked that that Bannon understood</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.890" end="00:43:08.570" style="s2">and certainly that our president fully</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.600" end="00:43:10.820" style="s2">as a as a figure of the media fully and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.570" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">deeply understands you think Trump</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.820" end="00:43:15.860" style="s2">himself am I read could be entirely</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:18.620" style="s2">wrong here is it Trump is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.860" end="00:43:21.710" style="s2">natural genius at rabble-rousing right</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.620" end="00:43:24.140" style="s2">and he also has this amazing ability to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.710" end="00:43:25.880" style="s2">be completely unconnected to reality</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.140" end="00:43:28.010" style="s2">like so as you were talking about people</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.880" end="00:43:29.780" style="s2">that would say red in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.010" end="00:43:33.560" style="s2">blue in the afternoon Trump does that</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.780" end="00:43:36.290" style="s2">with no psychological stress whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.560" end="00:43:40.850" style="s2">right five equals four four equals three</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.290" end="00:43:43.270" style="s2">okay and he has this amazing talent and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.850" end="00:43:45.200" style="s2">then Bannon was the one who then</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.270" end="00:43:47.540" style="s2">weaponized that with these insights</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.540" end="00:43:52.030" style="s2">talked about Marxist Leninist am I kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:56.410" style="s2">of think of the Trump administration as</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.030" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">banne inist trumpism right it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.410" end="00:44:03.620" style="s2">amalgam of trumps amazing idiot savant</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:06.260" style="s2">abilities and sort of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.620" end="00:44:09.050" style="s2">peculiarities plus bannon&#39;s insights</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.260" end="00:44:13.790" style="s2">does that make any sense to you to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.050" end="00:44:18.130" style="s2">degree certainly however you have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.790" end="00:44:21.400" style="s2">believe that that there is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.130" end="00:44:24.460" style="s2">map of being followed by the President</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.400" end="00:44:27.999" style="s2">himself whether a lot of it is intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.460" end="00:44:30.460" style="s2">or not there is a specificity with</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.999" end="00:44:34.539" style="s2">regard to the kinds of narratives he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.460" end="00:44:37.809" style="s2">pursuing a specificity to the strategies</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.539" end="00:44:40.960" style="s2">that he&#39;s running through that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.809" end="00:44:44.829" style="s2">yielding fairly specific results and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.960" end="00:44:47.829" style="s2">seemed to be consciously directed now</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.829" end="00:44:51.160" style="s2">again whether he&#39;s following some kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.829" end="00:44:54.430" style="s2">of instruction book or intuiting them</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.160" end="00:44:56.470" style="s2">himself I couldn&#39;t tell you but but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.430" end="00:44:59.109" style="s2">the results speak for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.470" end="00:45:01.450" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing him following the almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.109" end="00:45:03.489" style="s2">the checklist that was developed by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.450" end="00:45:05.499" style="s2">Russians that&#39;s interesting very</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.489" end="00:45:07.859" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.499" end="00:45:07.859" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.700" end="00:45:12.190" style="s2">here we go to the weaponization here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.839" end="00:45:15.190" style="s2">another one that fits the prototype that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.190" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">was a very different constituency and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.190" end="00:45:18.609" style="s2">intent at least it strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:20.499" style="s2">following many of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.609" end="00:45:22.539" style="s2">that you enumerated and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.499" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">extinction rebellion yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.539" end="00:45:28.569" style="s2">fascinating that&#39;s an example of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:31.690" style="s2">spontaneous self organized social system</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.569" end="00:45:32.950" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s transnational which i</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.690" end="00:45:35.259" style="s2">think is fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.950" end="00:45:38.710" style="s2">a lot of the ones that we followed thus</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.259" end="00:45:41.589" style="s2">far have remained national around the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.710" end="00:45:45.999" style="s2">world and it&#39;s interesting that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.589" end="00:45:49.809" style="s2">coalesced around a young girl a teenage</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.999" end="00:45:55.210" style="s2">girl who found a very simple and direct</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.809" end="00:45:58.359" style="s2">way of telling that story it it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.210" end="00:46:01.029" style="s2">be building momentum based on the power</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.359" end="00:46:04.660" style="s2">of narrative how easy it is to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.029" end="00:46:06.210" style="s2">on and of course how easy it is for</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.660" end="00:46:10.410" style="s2">people in this day and age to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.210" end="00:46:12.460" style="s2">participate in these kind of rivers of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.410" end="00:46:14.140" style="s2">narratives these kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.460" end="00:46:16.749" style="s2">journeys yeah and of course they also</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.140" end="00:46:19.420" style="s2">you know they they&#39;re pressing the piano</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.749" end="00:46:21.489" style="s2">keys for darkness very heavily right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.420" end="00:46:24.009" style="s2">saying a lot of things that aren&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.489" end="00:46:26.109" style="s2">that spin people up in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.009" end="00:46:27.589" style="s2">the worlds that end in 12 years blahblah</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.109" end="00:46:30.589" style="s2">right when and there</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.589" end="00:46:33.140" style="s2">no nuance to the story at all it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.589" end="00:46:35.630" style="s2">very pruned down to be easy to digest</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.140" end="00:46:40.239" style="s2">press all the negative buttons one can</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.630" end="00:46:46.279" style="s2">imagine etc well III think one can</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.239" end="00:46:49.450" style="s2">account for the role of Malcolm X as</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.890" end="00:47:16.309" style="s2">some of that but yes there&#39;s been more</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.219" end="00:47:18.769" style="s2">of this kind of extreme rhetoric around</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.359" end="00:48:13.969" style="s2">unfortunately you know we&#39;re suckers for</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:16.609" style="s2">narrative but we are creatures of</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.499" end="00:48:37.670" style="s2">hard to imagine let me ask you something</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.329" end="00:48:39.060" style="s2">Jim and I&#39;ve been curious about this it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.670" end="00:48:44.820" style="s2">seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.060" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">that right now infusing as much meaning</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.820" end="00:48:52.350" style="s2">as possible into words has been to rigor</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:54.540" style="s2">and we see this on the left and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.350" end="00:48:57.750" style="s2">right we see this in students on college</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.540" end="00:49:01.410" style="s2">campuses and things like that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.750" end="00:49:06.710" style="s2">wondered whether it would pay for us to</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.410" end="00:49:10.140" style="s2">explore diffusing language altogether</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.710" end="00:49:13.140" style="s2">and placing more distance between</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.140" end="00:49:15.800" style="s2">ourselves and words and recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.140" end="00:49:19.530" style="s2">words is just that things that have</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.800" end="00:49:23.460" style="s2">potentially no power at all so that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.530" end="00:49:28.980" style="s2">can get back to a level of decorum that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.460" end="00:49:33.620" style="s2">that could allow for a more even keeled</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.980" end="00:49:37.650" style="s2">debate or a the ability not to be so</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.620" end="00:49:40.860" style="s2">wounded and damaged by a rhetoric I get</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.650" end="00:49:43.790" style="s2">scared sometimes because if mythology is</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.860" end="00:49:47.490" style="s2">taught in school and and the students</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.790" end="00:49:49.560" style="s2">tell the professor I&#39;m gonna report you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.490" end="00:49:52.320" style="s2">because you just talked about a myth</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.560" end="00:49:55.620" style="s2">where the gods are raping each other and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.320" end="00:49:59.640" style="s2">and so forth we could start to lose our</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.620" end="00:50:02.730" style="s2">grip on understanding human nature and</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.640" end="00:50:03.030" style="s2">literature and the arts and things like</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.730" end="00:50:05.730" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.030" end="00:50:06.870" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s happening you know you</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.730" end="00:50:09.000" style="s2">know my take on it is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.870" end="00:50:11.040" style="s2">becoming reach rival eyes right you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.000" end="00:50:12.840" style="s2">these you know these factions like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:14.910" style="s2">wokes who you know do the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.840" end="00:50:17.100" style="s2">things you just described we have the oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.910" end="00:50:19.760" style="s2">right which have to have their own</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.100" end="00:50:22.050" style="s2">rhetoric and stories and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.760" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">fundamentalist religious people of three</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.050" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">or four different varieties and their</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:28.680" style="s2">people are becoming more intensely</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:31.440" style="s2">tribal and interrelated into a closed</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.680" end="00:50:33.570" style="s2">model of discourse rather than having a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:35.940" style="s2">broad social model of this course in</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.570" end="00:50:39.510" style="s2">which we can agree to disagree and do so</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.940" end="00:50:42.990" style="s2">civilly so Jim I&#39;m actually hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.510" end="00:50:46.440" style="s2">this is a phase that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.990" end="00:50:50.190" style="s2">experiencing because of the absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.440" end="00:50:52.710" style="s2">free availability for us to express</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.190" end="00:50:55.109" style="s2">ourselves anonymously or not</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.710" end="00:50:58.770" style="s2">remember where I came from I came from</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.109" end="00:51:02.819" style="s2">fandom Star Wars fans hated Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.770" end="00:51:05.700" style="s2">fans absolutely and in sports fandom</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.819" end="00:51:07.800" style="s2">there are these terrific rivalries and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.700" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">and and you can see fights and even</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.800" end="00:51:14.309" style="s2">riots take place because you know fans</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:17.790" style="s2">are on the sides of different sports</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.309" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">teams the reason those things could</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.790" end="00:51:23.579" style="s2">happen the way they happen was because</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:26.040" style="s2">the fans were allowed essentially to</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.579" end="00:51:29.940" style="s2">network they were put in direct contact</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.040" end="00:51:32.609" style="s2">with each other and so were given forums</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.940" end="00:51:36.569" style="s2">to kind of advocate for their tribes</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.609" end="00:51:39.990" style="s2">right now the entire planet has been</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.569" end="00:51:44.460" style="s2">given the opportunity to do that and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.990" end="00:51:46.500" style="s2">we are factionalized we are tribal izing</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.460" end="00:51:49.770" style="s2">across all these different subjects and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.500" end="00:51:53.880" style="s2">so forth the reason I have some optimism</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.770" end="00:51:57.059" style="s2">Jim is is because there are children who</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.880" end="00:52:00.089" style="s2">are now growing up within this who are a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.059" end="00:52:02.910" style="s2">bit more chill because they&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.089" end="00:52:06.230" style="s2">had a voice I&#39;m talking about gen Z I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.910" end="00:52:10.440" style="s2">talking about kids 18 and under roughly</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.230" end="00:52:14.790" style="s2">maybe 19 20 they&#39;ve grown up with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.440" end="00:52:15.930" style="s2">free and clear ability to just be on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.790" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">Internet</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.930" end="00:52:20.970" style="s2">yes there&#39;s internet bullying and things</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:23.940" style="s2">like that but generally they&#39;re freely</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.970" end="00:52:29.220" style="s2">expressing themselves and don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.940" end="00:52:33.660" style="s2">have this level of avarice and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.220" end="00:52:35.339" style="s2">selfishness and and tribalism amongst</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.660" end="00:52:37.770" style="s2">them at least what we&#39;re observing and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.339" end="00:52:40.440" style="s2">we that&#39;s part of my job is to is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.770" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">watch these things so I&#39;m hoping that as</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.440" end="00:52:46.500" style="s2">these young people come into prominence</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">and start to help run the world that</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.500" end="00:52:52.170" style="s2">we&#39;ll all get a little more chill so</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:54.210" style="s2">interestingly you know you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.170" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">people like Jonathan hate and some of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.210" end="00:52:59.130" style="s2">the others who have been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:53:01.380" style="s2">what&#39;s going on on college campuses the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.130" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">reports back seemed to be that actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.380" end="00:53:06.030" style="s2">it&#39;s getting worse on college campuses</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:06.580" style="s2">that this woke phenomena is just</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.030" end="00:53:07.750" style="s2">complete</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.580" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">really out of control um you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.750" end="00:53:13.000" style="s2">examples that you gave and that anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:15.010" style="s2">this tribal ization is at least on</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.000" end="00:53:16.600" style="s2">college campuses I can&#39;t say less for</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.010" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">the non college people which of course</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.600" end="00:53:20.920" style="s2">people need to remember is two-thirds of</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:23.590" style="s2">the country at least on college campuses</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.920" end="00:53:26.110" style="s2">this pressure cooker of tribal ization</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.590" end="00:53:29.230" style="s2">yeah and not just the wokes but also the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.110" end="00:53:30.760" style="s2">antelopes are also binding together with</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.230" end="00:53:33.360" style="s2">you know becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.760" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">inflammatory etc so I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.360" end="00:53:38.440" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing in the 18 to 21 year</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:40.570" style="s2">old crew actually bears that out your</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.440" end="00:53:43.120" style="s2">your point is well-taken I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.570" end="00:53:45.490" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of steam being led</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.120" end="00:53:48.280" style="s2">off in perhaps the wrong direction</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.490" end="00:53:51.750" style="s2">because young people feel that they are</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.280" end="00:53:55.510" style="s2">not able to assert as best they can</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.750" end="00:53:58.120" style="s2">some national direction determine the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.510" end="00:54:01.000" style="s2">outcomes of major elections and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.120" end="00:54:04.210" style="s2">and so the the small ponds becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.000" end="00:54:07.980" style="s2">place where they are expressing their</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.210" end="00:54:11.290" style="s2">anxieties but I also think that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.980" end="00:54:14.620" style="s2">generation gap is pretty much the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.290" end="00:54:18.610" style="s2">largest one that we have ever seen in</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.620" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">the history of humanity so these kids</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.610" end="00:54:24.160" style="s2">are communicating with one another and</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:27.850" style="s2">super positioning themselves on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.160" end="00:54:31.870" style="s2">Internet in in all of these interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.850" end="00:54:36.420" style="s2">and complex ways and they&#39;re professors</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.870" end="00:54:39.100" style="s2">who maybe 10 or 20 years older than them</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.420" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">don&#39;t have access to any of that and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.100" end="00:54:45.070" style="s2">have very little understanding for what</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:49.600" style="s2">amounts to an entirely different way of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.070" end="00:54:53.110" style="s2">being with its own language with its own</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.600" end="00:54:57.040" style="s2">cultures and this is creating a friction</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.110" end="00:55:01.090" style="s2">in and of itself this isn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.040" end="00:55:04.300" style="s2">some some hippy slang from the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.090" end="00:55:07.060" style="s2">this is an entirely different wave of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.300" end="00:55:09.160" style="s2">being and young people aren&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.060" end="00:55:12.730" style="s2">taught that they&#39;re not being taught</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.160" end="00:55:14.800" style="s2">media literacy in school so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.730" end="00:55:18.010" style="s2">having a difficult time reaching across</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.800" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">these divides to make connections with</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.010" end="00:55:22.450" style="s2">older people and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:26.589" style="s2">festers and and other authority figures</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.589" end="00:55:32.049" style="s2">to figure out why these kids think</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:35.079" style="s2">believe and behave this way</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.049" end="00:55:37.299" style="s2">they&#39;re just judging them and and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.079" end="00:55:39.969" style="s2">creates more friction and of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.299" end="00:55:42.219" style="s2">probably you know the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.969" end="00:55:44.410" style="s2">essentially the fractal ability to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.219" end="00:55:46.390" style="s2">organize at every level from the micro</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.410" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">to the macro makes us much more</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.390" end="00:55:51.400" style="s2">confusing for the older folks you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:53.469" style="s2">back to my day say you know nineteen in</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.400" end="00:55:55.150" style="s2">the 60s we based had three factions the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.469" end="00:55:57.459" style="s2">jocks the hippies and the collegiates</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.150" end="00:55:59.049" style="s2">right it wasn&#39;t that hard to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.459" end="00:56:00.940" style="s2">what&#39;s of the three you were in and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.049" end="00:56:02.769" style="s2">maybe they were halfway in between I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.940" end="00:56:04.749" style="s2">probably halfway between the hippies and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.769" end="00:56:07.089" style="s2">the collegiates right but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.749" end="00:56:08.739" style="s2">basically three big boxes today there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.089" end="00:56:10.709" style="s2">a zillion levels at which people</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.739" end="00:56:13.569" style="s2">identify and organize and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.709" end="00:56:16.059" style="s2">multi-dimensional intersectional etc so</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.569" end="00:56:18.459" style="s2">it&#39;s a much more difficult cognitive map</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.059" end="00:56:21.900" style="s2">for us poor old fogies to try to figure</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.459" end="00:56:24.279" style="s2">out I&#39;m gonna call you on the Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.900" end="00:56:26.709" style="s2">and and what I want you to think about</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.279" end="00:56:30.309" style="s2">okay because it&#39;s easy to say are these</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.709" end="00:56:32.940" style="s2">kids today but think about infinite</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.309" end="00:56:35.739" style="s2">diversity in infinite combinations</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.940" end="00:56:38.799" style="s2">that&#39;s in some ways that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.739" end="00:56:42.640" style="s2">right now and if we step back far enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.799" end="00:56:44.949" style="s2">and look at the expression and look at</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.640" end="00:56:48.069" style="s2">their ways of communicating and look at</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.949" end="00:56:52.049" style="s2">the fact that they are enjoying being</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.069" end="00:56:56.769" style="s2">somewhere on various spectra or</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.049" end="00:57:00.579" style="s2">spectrums that&#39;s beautiful in a way I</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.769" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">like the fact that that a child can can</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.579" end="00:57:08.859" style="s2">walk into a school and say I&#39;m as a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:12.759" style="s2">upsetting when they get angry with you</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.859" end="00:57:16.229" style="s2">for forgetting that there is a or or</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.759" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">what-have-you but but isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.229" end="00:57:23.459" style="s2">fascinating that that we have become</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:28.420" style="s2">like the United Federation of Planets</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.459" end="00:57:32.310" style="s2">just on planet earth and allowing for</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.420" end="00:57:35.670" style="s2">that I can tell you both for firsthand</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.310" end="00:57:40.740" style="s2">through close observation particularly</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.670" end="00:57:44.430" style="s2">of this gen z cohort that that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.740" end="00:57:48.150" style="s2">allows for liberation that aspect has</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.430" end="00:57:50.460" style="s2">has helped them to reduce the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.150" end="00:57:53.480" style="s2">anxieties those of us particularly those</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.460" end="00:57:56.630" style="s2">of us who were different in in some way</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.480" end="00:58:00.770" style="s2">never got to experience in previous</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.630" end="00:58:06.390" style="s2">generations so there there is some</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.770" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">something wonderful about what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.390" end="00:58:10.200" style="s2">going on today yeah that want to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:12.600" style="s2">clear I was not hacking on the kids</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.200" end="00:58:14.220" style="s2">today you know I was actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.600" end="00:58:16.260" style="s2">make the distinction that the older</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.220" end="00:58:18.120" style="s2">folks looking back at this fractal world</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.260" end="00:58:19.950" style="s2">where everybody has a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.120" end="00:58:23.070" style="s2">positioning themselves in many</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.950" end="00:58:26.220" style="s2">dimensions is inherently a difficult gap</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.070" end="00:58:29.190" style="s2">to transcend not to say that frankly I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.220" end="00:58:31.550" style="s2">with you I think probably these more</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.190" end="00:58:34.530" style="s2">dimensions of freedom will end up good</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.550" end="00:58:37.290" style="s2">though I suppose the one question mark I</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.530" end="00:58:40.680" style="s2">might put on it is will we lose any</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.290" end="00:58:42.870" style="s2">sense of social coherence and will our</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.680" end="00:58:44.730" style="s2">society be strong enough to persevere</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.870" end="00:58:47.700" style="s2">against challengers who are more</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.730" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">coherent than us wow that&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.700" end="00:58:52.920" style="s2">I&#39;m a little bit optimistic I&#39;m from New</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:54.510" style="s2">York but I&#39;m optimistic we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.920" end="00:58:57.630" style="s2">get through this transition this</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.510" end="00:59:01.370" style="s2">transition is bigger than the advent of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.630" end="00:59:05.220" style="s2">radio or television or any broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.370" end="00:59:07.680" style="s2">medium when we were all sitting in front</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.220" end="00:59:10.920" style="s2">of something and watching or listening</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.680" end="00:59:13.830" style="s2">to it there were a very small number of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.920" end="00:59:17.700" style="s2">people who are establishing our reality</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.830" end="00:59:19.890" style="s2">for us and there wasn&#39;t much choice in</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.700" end="00:59:22.800" style="s2">terms of how we responded to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.890" end="00:59:26.310" style="s2">reality maybe if a small percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.800" end="00:59:29.280" style="s2">us rebelled against it another small</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.310" end="00:59:33.060" style="s2">percentage of us as a kind of super took</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.280" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">advantage of it and became people who</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.060" end="00:59:38.310" style="s2">took advantage in the system but by and</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:42.150" style="s2">large there was this age of broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.310" end="00:59:44.820" style="s2">that lasted for 150 180 years with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.150" end="00:59:46.710" style="s2">advent of mass media now the printing</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.820" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">press and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.710" end="00:59:52.320" style="s2">now we are in a new age Jim we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:55.099" style="s2">age of pervasive communication and we</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.320" end="00:59:58.290" style="s2">are attempting to find our footing and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.099" end="00:59:59.700" style="s2">and when everyone&#39;s a broadcaster things</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.290" end="01:00:03.300" style="s2">are going to get messed up and things</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.700" end="01:00:06.930" style="s2">are going to get confusing and people</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.300" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">you know have learned how to to try and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.930" end="01:00:15.210" style="s2">and fire cannons near the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:18.510" style="s2">murmuration of birds you know to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.210" end="01:00:20.609" style="s2">a try and push us in in certain</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.510" end="01:00:23.220" style="s2">directions that&#39;s those those</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.609" end="01:00:25.349" style="s2">multilateral stories like what happened</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.220" end="01:00:27.810" style="s2">in Russia maybe what&#39;s happening here in</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.349" end="01:00:30.210" style="s2">the United States today but we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.810" end="01:00:32.220" style="s2">to get a grip I believe we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.210" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">start to figure out what these</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.220" end="01:00:39.030" style="s2">methodologies are and how to kind of you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:42.690" style="s2">know transcend them and and then our</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.030" end="01:00:44.310" style="s2">diversity will become a strength I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.690" end="01:00:47.970" style="s2">believe that we&#39;re going to defuse</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.310" end="01:00:50.550" style="s2">ourselves out of existence I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.970" end="01:00:52.760" style="s2">going to be able to to get our act</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.420" end="01:00:58.490" style="s2">I like it&#39;s a good thought you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.760" end="01:01:00.310" style="s2">hopeful enlightenment view I would say</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.490" end="01:01:03.770" style="s2">right think about you know who&#39;s our</p>

<p begin="01:01:10.580" end="01:01:14.210" style="s2">then we have the Russians which are</p>

<p begin="01:01:19.670" end="01:01:23.810" style="s2">right we may be able to explore the</p>

<p begin="01:03:29.020" end="01:03:33.430" style="s2">mean I think that the American people</p>

<p begin="01:03:45.550" end="01:03:49.780" style="s2">they can lose their ass right now if all</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.010" end="01:03:52.990" style="s2">decent Americans would say we&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.619" end="01:04:03.340" style="s2">where we just do not accept that from</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.960" end="01:04:06.220" style="s2">our American company wouldn&#39;t it be</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.340" end="01:04:10.210" style="s2">wonderful if that movement didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.220" end="01:04:12.300" style="s2">to start because our leaders said that</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.210" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">is unacceptable</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.300" end="01:04:18.910" style="s2">just as Americans that&#39;s that behavior</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:22.300" style="s2">is unacceptable and told the NBA would</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.910" end="01:04:25.330" style="s2">you stop that and so forth or or for</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.300" end="01:04:30.040" style="s2">example the fact that so much of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.330" end="01:04:33.099" style="s2">real estate in my city is is now owned</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.040" end="01:04:36.900" style="s2">by a factions outside of this country</p>

<p begin="01:04:41.320" end="01:04:47.440" style="s2">are not in the interest of my city but</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.500" end="01:04:51.490" style="s2">have to be acceded to because they own</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.440" end="01:04:52.990" style="s2">huge numbers of blocks of real estate in</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.490" end="01:04:55.780" style="s2">in my city</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.990" end="01:04:58.000" style="s2">that&#39;s an insidious you know incursion</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.780" end="01:04:59.859" style="s2">into our integrity</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.000" end="01:05:02.230" style="s2">absolutely and unfortunately Real</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.859" end="01:05:04.359" style="s2">Estate&#39;s a good one right because they</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.230" end="01:05:06.099" style="s2">can&#39;t take it with them right they act</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.359" end="01:05:07.510" style="s2">like a bunch of assholes we say go back</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.099" end="01:05:10.450" style="s2">where you came from we&#39;re taking your</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.510" end="01:05:12.190" style="s2">real estate you clowns right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.450" end="01:05:14.109" style="s2">something that people could do should</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.190" end="01:05:15.580" style="s2">they get them self-sufficient organize</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.109" end="01:05:17.080" style="s2">so I never bothers me and people say oh</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.580" end="01:05:18.490" style="s2">yeah the Chinese are buying up this or</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.080" end="01:05:19.990" style="s2">that well well they get too obnoxious</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.490" end="01:05:22.450" style="s2">was kicking the hell out</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.990" end="01:05:25.060" style="s2">take it back right but and yet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.450" end="01:05:28.180" style="s2">right now that would be incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.060" end="01:05:30.310" style="s2">difficult to do because they they own so</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.180" end="01:05:32.470" style="s2">much that to kick them out would mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.310" end="01:05:34.660" style="s2">those buildings get emptied out well</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.470" end="01:05:38.050" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna who&#39;s gonna pay those rents</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.660" end="01:05:40.750" style="s2">who&#39;s going to own those massive</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.050" end="01:05:44.440" style="s2">multimillion-dollar apartments and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.750" end="01:05:47.730" style="s2">forth it would be easier to just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.440" end="01:05:50.800" style="s2">quietly give them what they wanted which</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.730" end="01:05:54.220" style="s2">corrupts our politics corrupts our civic</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.800" end="01:05:57.040" style="s2">situation here and it&#39;s it&#39;s it can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.220" end="01:06:01.210" style="s2">not that easy to do just to simply say</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.040" end="01:06:04.570" style="s2">beat it yeah so so these are these are</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.210" end="01:06:08.430" style="s2">forces that are pressing on us that if</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.570" end="01:06:11.020" style="s2">our leadership is not holding to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.430" end="01:06:14.800" style="s2">foundational values the American</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.020" end="01:06:18.280" style="s2">narrative if that kind of collapses on</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.800" end="01:06:20.920" style="s2">itself then we could easily be</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.280" end="01:06:23.920" style="s2">overwhelmed by these techniques these</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.920" end="01:06:27.430" style="s2">strategies these stringencies these</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.920" end="01:06:30.520" style="s2">different ways of being that could cause</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.430" end="01:06:33.250" style="s2">our fall and and those are things that</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.520" end="01:06:35.619" style="s2">Jordan greenhalgh and Daniel Martin Berg</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.250" end="01:06:38.470" style="s2">are really concerned about that I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.619" end="01:06:41.020" style="s2">little bit apart of that group that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.470" end="01:06:44.410" style="s2">has that concern about what direction</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.020" end="01:06:46.089" style="s2">the world is going in yeah indeed let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.410" end="01:06:48.910" style="s2">make that our last topic we&#39;ll talk a</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.089" end="01:06:50.410" style="s2">little bit about game B mmm if you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.910" end="01:06:53.680" style="s2">Jordan you know Daniel then you knew</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.410" end="01:06:55.480" style="s2">about game be sure actually Jordan and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.680" end="01:06:59.230" style="s2">and about 28 other people actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.480" end="01:07:00.849" style="s2">cooked up game B back in 2013 and we</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.230" end="01:07:02.050" style="s2">developed a fair amount of doctrine then</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.849" end="01:07:03.790" style="s2">it didn&#39;t really seem to be going</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.050" end="01:07:06.339" style="s2">anywhere and we all kind of went our way</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.790" end="01:07:07.390" style="s2">and did our own little game via stuff or</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.339" end="01:07:08.950" style="s2">not hmm</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.390" end="01:07:10.839" style="s2">frankly I didn&#39;t mostly I worked on</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.950" end="01:07:13.660" style="s2">other things but it seems like game B is</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.839" end="01:07:16.530" style="s2">coming back again a surprising amount of</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.660" end="01:07:18.700" style="s2">traffic on Twitter on Facebook etc and</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.530" end="01:07:21.430" style="s2">for those listeners who don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.700" end="01:07:25.000" style="s2">it is you can go check out the game B</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.430" end="01:07:27.940" style="s2">group on Facebook or check out game B</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.000" end="01:07:29.020" style="s2">all one word hashtag on Twitter and</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.940" end="01:07:31.900" style="s2">you&#39;ll see a surprising amount of</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.020" end="01:07:33.880" style="s2">traffic and essentially what game B is</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.900" end="01:07:36.580" style="s2">is it&#39;s still a fairly hey</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.880" end="01:07:39.130" style="s2">easy and rough attempt to define a new</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.580" end="01:07:40.900" style="s2">social operating system for at least the</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.130" end="01:07:43.030" style="s2">civilization and maybe for the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.900" end="01:07:45.310" style="s2">that keeps us from committing ecocide</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.030" end="01:07:46.780" style="s2">which we appear to be on you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.310" end="01:07:49.990" style="s2">despite what I said about extinction</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.780" end="01:07:52.360" style="s2">rebellion the basic idea is correct that</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.990" end="01:07:54.430" style="s2">if we don&#39;t reform our ways we will</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.360" end="01:07:55.960" style="s2">destroy our the carrying capacity of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.430" end="01:07:58.930" style="s2">earth and there&#39;ll be a massive die-off</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.960" end="01:08:01.180" style="s2">and we need to find new ways of being</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.930" end="01:08:03.340" style="s2">that aren&#39;t I mean frankly these</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.180" end="01:08:05.770" style="s2">jackasses that have these 22,000 square</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.340" end="01:08:07.450" style="s2">foot town housing apartments in New York</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.770" end="01:08:11.110" style="s2">they should really just be taken out</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.450" end="01:08:12.760" style="s2">shot right or at least be nice put on a</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.110" end="01:08:23.530" style="s2">barge and sent back from whence they</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.760" end="01:08:25.000" style="s2">came and then fill those places full of</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.530" end="01:08:26.770" style="s2">the homeless right nobody Hall most</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.000" end="01:08:28.450" style="s2">people are the United States right no</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.770" end="01:08:30.520" style="s2">reason we couldn&#39;t do that if we had the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.450" end="01:08:32.170" style="s2">will but that&#39;s just an example of some</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.520" end="01:08:34.060" style="s2">radical thinking outside the box whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.170" end="01:08:36.310" style="s2">idea of game B is let&#39;s start with a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.060" end="01:08:39.130" style="s2">blank sheet of paper no we want to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.310" end="01:08:41.620" style="s2">ecocide and a major die-off and collapse</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.130" end="01:08:43.810" style="s2">and and essentially we want to create</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.620" end="01:08:46.390" style="s2">the operating system the values the way</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.810" end="01:08:48.940" style="s2">we react with each other the ethos to</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.390" end="01:08:51.550" style="s2">make a truly better world back to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.940" end="01:08:53.560" style="s2">original game B we had a concept of we</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.550" end="01:08:55.240" style="s2">say we want the game B world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.560" end="01:08:56.800" style="s2">basically it&#39;s to create a society</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.240" end="01:08:58.960" style="s2">little you know this is I think very</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.800" end="01:09:02.620" style="s2">simple but powerful that we would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.960" end="01:09:06.520" style="s2">happy to live in ourselves truly happy</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.620" end="01:09:08.440" style="s2">and proud to leave to our children I</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.520" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can say either of those</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.440" end="01:09:12.310" style="s2">things about our current world at least</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:14.560" style="s2">most people can&#39;t and so we start with</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.310" end="01:09:17.200" style="s2">that at this stage is still preliminary</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.560" end="01:09:20.020" style="s2">but it struck me when I was doing my</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.200" end="01:09:22.240" style="s2">research that you build imaginary world</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.020" end="01:09:26.070" style="s2">yes some level that&#39;s that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.240" end="01:09:30.340" style="s2">superpower game B is in its own</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.070" end="01:09:33.100" style="s2">struggling early partial kind of way</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.340" end="01:09:35.050" style="s2">trying to think about what a new world</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.100" end="01:09:36.970" style="s2">would look like of course we have the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.050" end="01:09:38.530" style="s2">constraint in the game B space that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.970" end="01:09:40.750" style="s2">we&#39;re operating in the real world right</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.530" end="01:09:42.490" style="s2">when you&#39;re developing an imaginary</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.750" end="01:09:44.740" style="s2">world for a movie you have a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.490" end="01:09:46.720" style="s2">degrees of freedom but let&#39;s jam a bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.740" end="01:09:47.790" style="s2">you know what are some things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.720" end="01:09:50.040" style="s2">people should be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.790" end="01:09:51.630" style="s2">when we&#39;re designing designing is tube</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.040" end="01:09:53.520" style="s2">stronger because it has that utopian</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.630" end="01:09:55.170" style="s2">flavor you know just follow these</p>

<p begin="01:09:55.170" end="01:09:59.550" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be it&#39;s gonna unfold</p>

<p begin="01:12:21.830" end="01:12:30.239" style="s2">necessary is for us to understand how</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.190" end="01:12:34.830" style="s2">and why negativity can be so pervasive</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.239" end="01:12:37.590" style="s2">and how to remove it from our lives I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.830" end="01:12:41.159" style="s2">started examining the way that human</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.590" end="01:12:44.940" style="s2">consciousness works and its relationship</p>

<p begin="01:13:07.619" end="01:13:13.800" style="s2">fantastic I take them those have helped</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.440" end="01:13:17.210" style="s2">me think more clearly perhaps even</p>

<p begin="01:13:17.210" end="01:13:23.369" style="s2">person and by negative I mean these kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.190" end="01:13:25.860" style="s2">of strange defaults that exist since</p>

<p begin="01:13:51.300" end="01:13:57.210" style="s2">great game B conversation there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.699" end="01:13:59.510" style="s2">tension between personal development I</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.210" end="01:14:02.659" style="s2">guess I would describe it and building</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.510" end="01:14:05.159" style="s2">institutions to help us be better people</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.659" end="01:14:07.910" style="s2">sounds like your suggestion is to start</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.159" end="01:14:11.150" style="s2">with the personal development side maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.910" end="01:14:14.930" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the easier of the two</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.150" end="01:14:19.580" style="s2">because personal development it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.930" end="01:14:24.830" style="s2">for me because I am the poster child for</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.580" end="01:14:27.970" style="s2">how story can take someone from the</p>

<p begin="01:14:32.410" end="01:14:38.440" style="s2">you know a fair modicum of of success</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.210" end="01:14:41.060" style="s2">and live a life that I could have only</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.440" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">dreamt about I couldn&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.060" end="01:14:47.060" style="s2">dreamed these experiences that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:50.120" style="s2">having right now and that is because of</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.060" end="01:14:52.910" style="s2">story and the impact of story maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.120" end="01:14:56.480" style="s2">little bit of love here and there but</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.910" end="01:14:57.830" style="s2">mostly story let&#39;s also be honest both</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.480" end="01:15:00.410" style="s2">of us you know had interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.830" end="01:15:02.090" style="s2">successful careers let&#39;s not let&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.410" end="01:15:15.590" style="s2">not disregard the fact that we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.090" end="01:15:18.500" style="s2">had a lot of luck anything was no you</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.590" end="01:15:21.160" style="s2">know and and it was a kind of fierce</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.500" end="01:15:24.560" style="s2">determination a kind of street fighter</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.160" end="01:15:27.290" style="s2">mentality that that caused me to figure</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:30.110" style="s2">out things yeah the luck comes into play</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.290" end="01:15:34.940" style="s2">but you make that luck because I fought</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.110" end="01:15:36.740" style="s2">against myself I&#39;m shy I had OCD all I</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.940" end="01:15:42.800" style="s2">wanted to do was walk back and forth in</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.740" end="01:15:45.740" style="s2">my bedroom so it was a real fight of</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.800" end="01:15:49.850" style="s2">grappling with myself to push myself</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.740" end="01:15:52.670" style="s2">into these social situations that</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.850" end="01:15:55.310" style="s2">resulted in the luck of meeting certain</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.670" end="01:15:58.160" style="s2">people are the opportunities that that</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.310" end="01:16:02.390" style="s2">happens to come along so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.160" end="01:16:04.460" style="s2">a I try to teach young people about how</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.390" end="01:16:06.530" style="s2">luck you know don&#39;t think about luck</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.460" end="01:16:07.220" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got to there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:16:07.220" end="01:16:13.100" style="s2">in order for what to come into play I</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.400" end="01:16:15.440" style="s2">say the same thing you know if you push</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.100" end="01:16:17.960" style="s2">against the world hard your share of</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.440" end="01:16:20.000" style="s2">luck will probably come your way plus a</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.960" end="01:16:21.360" style="s2">little bit but but the other part is you</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.000" end="01:16:23.580" style="s2">have to be prepared and</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.360" end="01:16:25.770" style="s2">fearless and courageous and go with it</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.580" end="01:16:27.660" style="s2">right you know I still think about the</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.770" end="01:16:30.960" style="s2">amazing bit of luck I had when I was 26</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.660" end="01:16:32.520" style="s2">or 27 but it involved quitting my job my</p>

<p begin="01:16:32.520" end="01:16:38.820" style="s2">moving to Boston and starting a company</p>

<p begin="01:16:40.860" end="01:16:44.460" style="s2">did it and it was successful and that</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.720" end="01:16:45.920" style="s2">you know change the complete reject eree</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.460" end="01:16:48.030" style="s2">of our lives</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.920" end="01:16:49.290" style="s2">because you know the luck was meeting</p>

<p begin="01:16:49.290" end="01:16:53.250" style="s2">place but the other part of it was being</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.090" end="01:16:55.110" style="s2">you know decisive and courageous and</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.250" end="01:16:57.090" style="s2">willing to follow that opportunity</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.470" end="01:18:25.440" style="s2">agree with you truthfully we tried to</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.690" end="01:18:27.300" style="s2">build our own platform back in 2013 and</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.440" end="01:18:28.890" style="s2">as you would have predicted it was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.300" end="01:18:31.260" style="s2">whole lot of work and didn&#39;t get any</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.890" end="01:18:33.990" style="s2">traction much easier to tell a better</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.260" end="01:18:34.550" style="s2">story across the platforms that exists</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.990" end="01:18:36.889" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.550" end="01:18:39.079" style="s2">part that I push heavily is my doctrine</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.889" end="01:18:40.820" style="s2">of weak links and strong links and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.079" end="01:18:43.070" style="s2">is that no matter what platform you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.820" end="01:18:45.530" style="s2">on most relationships in the online</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.070" end="01:18:47.449" style="s2">world are inherently weak links</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.530" end="01:18:49.760" style="s2">you know the people I know only through</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.449" end="01:18:52.400" style="s2">the Internet are generally not people I</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.760" end="01:18:54.500" style="s2">would ask to help me out if I got into a</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.400" end="01:18:56.090" style="s2">jam or as I like to say you know a</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.500" end="01:18:57.739" style="s2">friend is someone that will help you</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.090" end="01:19:02.540" style="s2">move a real friend is somebody that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.739" end="01:19:04.099" style="s2">help you move a body I doubt you make</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.540" end="01:19:05.869" style="s2">too many real friends on the internet so</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.099" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">I keep pushing and I think it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.869" end="01:19:10.610" style="s2">accepted in the game be world that we</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:13.610" style="s2">need to build a tapestry that uses the</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.610" end="01:19:15.559" style="s2">inexpensive wide-ranging weak links to</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.610" end="01:19:17.570" style="s2">meet people but then to damn sure make</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.559" end="01:19:19.760" style="s2">sure that when we can get together face</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.570" end="01:19:21.920" style="s2">to face and also to build a real</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.760" end="01:19:25.849" style="s2">face-to-face community where we live</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.920" end="01:19:28.190" style="s2">because you know as Apes with clothes we</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.849" end="01:19:31.130" style="s2">really are all about you know being with</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.190" end="01:19:32.630" style="s2">other humans conviviality is the word I</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.130" end="01:19:35.389" style="s2">think that&#39;s starting to be used in game</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.630" end="01:19:37.730" style="s2">B to describe the fact that what really</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.389" end="01:19:40.190" style="s2">rings our bell is being with our friends</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.730" end="01:19:42.619" style="s2">or family you know having food and drink</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.190" end="01:19:44.599" style="s2">and singing songs and clapping each</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.619" end="01:19:46.550" style="s2">other on the back and telling jokes and</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.599" end="01:19:48.739" style="s2">those kinds of things and I certainly</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.550" end="01:19:51.050" style="s2">hope that as game B moves forward it</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.739" end="01:19:54.829" style="s2">won&#39;t forget you know the real face to</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.050" end="01:19:57.619" style="s2">face human stuff and over emphasize the</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.829" end="01:20:02.409" style="s2">network stuff I&#39;ll agree with you Jim</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.619" end="01:20:06.469" style="s2">don&#39;t underestimate the level of</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.409" end="01:20:08.469" style="s2">intimacy and connection that that can be</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.469" end="01:20:14.239" style="s2">possible with the technological</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.469" end="01:20:19.159" style="s2">interface as we stumble past augmented</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.239" end="01:20:21.920" style="s2">and virtual reality into scenarios where</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.159" end="01:20:23.659" style="s2">we will in effect be able to look into</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.920" end="01:20:28.699" style="s2">each other&#39;s eyes across great distances</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.659" end="01:20:32.630" style="s2">I believe we can develop strong and</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.699" end="01:20:36.469" style="s2">powerful relationships move the body</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.630" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">kind of relationships and again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.469" end="01:20:42.739" style="s2">seeing this with the youngest of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.199" end="01:20:46.210" style="s2">prominent generations and if and when</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.739" end="01:20:49.150" style="s2">that&#39;s possible it will be possible</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.210" end="01:20:52.620" style="s2">to activate very large numbers of them</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.150" end="01:20:56.700" style="s2">through a passionate storytelling and</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.620" end="01:21:00.000" style="s2">and passionate requests for assistance</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.700" end="01:21:03.550" style="s2">so that while you&#39;re seeing these</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.000" end="01:21:05.980" style="s2">massive movements coalesce and form and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.550" end="01:21:08.860" style="s2">in some cases push things past the</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.980" end="01:21:13.810" style="s2">tipping point to change you&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.860" end="01:21:17.470" style="s2">to see them do this through work largely</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.810" end="01:21:20.650" style="s2">online that can bring us closer to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.470" end="01:21:23.070" style="s2">realization of Plan B just leave</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.650" end="01:21:25.570" style="s2">yourself open to to that possibility</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.070" end="01:21:28.750" style="s2">because it is it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.570" end="01:21:30.730" style="s2">fascinating that where we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.750" end="01:21:32.890" style="s2">seeds of right now yeah that would be</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.730" end="01:21:34.030" style="s2">interesting you know you probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.890" end="01:21:36.250" style="s2">know this about me but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.030" end="01:21:38.470" style="s2">involved with building our online world</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.250" end="01:21:40.150" style="s2">since 1980 I went to work for the very</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.470" end="01:21:42.400" style="s2">first company for the that was had a</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.150" end="01:21:44.650" style="s2">consumer online service and so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.400" end="01:21:48.070" style="s2">doing you know the many too many online</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.650" end="01:21:51.610" style="s2">social media we&#39;d call it now for almost</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.070" end="01:21:53.860" style="s2">40 years and and yet and are there are</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.610" end="01:21:55.330" style="s2">some cases where I have made some</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.860" end="01:21:57.940" style="s2">relationships that are as good as the</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.330" end="01:21:59.590" style="s2">real world but not that often but it</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.940" end="01:22:01.870" style="s2">would be interesting if the new tools</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.590" end="01:22:04.030" style="s2">and at some point they maybe there can</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.870" end="01:22:06.460" style="s2">do that but so I guess I would amend my</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.030" end="01:22:08.950" style="s2">statement a little bit use weak links to</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.460" end="01:22:11.080" style="s2">reach lots of people but build the real</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.950" end="01:22:13.270" style="s2">thing with strong links and today that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.080" end="01:22:15.430" style="s2">mostly face-to-face but perhaps in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.270" end="01:22:17.170" style="s2">future as our technology gets richer and</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.430" end="01:22:19.720" style="s2">as you say something beyond augmented</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.170" end="01:22:21.820" style="s2">reality maybe brain-to-brain networking</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.720" end="01:22:23.320" style="s2">over time the ability to build strong</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.820" end="01:22:25.750" style="s2">links could also move into the virtual</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.320" end="01:22:27.820" style="s2">and we should be open to that and not</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.750" end="01:22:31.030" style="s2">close our eyes to it I think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.820" end="01:22:34.720" style="s2">too far off Jim that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.030" end="01:22:37.690" style="s2">I appreciate the consideration anyway</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.720" end="01:22:39.040" style="s2">this has been wonderful you know Jeff</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.690" end="01:22:41.650" style="s2">this was everything I would hope it</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.040" end="01:22:45.010" style="s2">would be oh gosh absolutely rich and</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.650" end="01:22:46.360" style="s2">fascinating and wonderful and that we&#39;ve</p>
