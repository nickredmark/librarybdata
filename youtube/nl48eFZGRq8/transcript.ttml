<p begin="00:00:02.970" end="00:00:07.410" style="s2">it is being recorded good</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.100" end="00:00:11.099" style="s2">no I don&#39;t know Brett I don&#39;t know Brett</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.410" end="00:00:16.350" style="s2">so I I met Brett a long time ago like 11</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.099" end="00:00:21.570" style="s2">12 years ago and at the time he was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.350" end="00:00:26.820" style="s2">self-proclaimed very marginal professor</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.570" end="00:00:28.650" style="s2">at Evergreen which is yeah we pretty see</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.820" end="00:00:32.130" style="s2">out there but you know called</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.650" end="00:00:33.870" style="s2">experimental College yeah who had some</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.130" end="00:00:35.489" style="s2">good stuff like you know I spent time</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.870" end="00:00:36.930" style="s2">with him in his program was that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.489" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">time was also very marginal so the hedge</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.930" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">fund trader who was working on physics</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">and it as a hobby very and then of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">course as things have happened as it</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:51.149" style="s2">turns out the fact that Eric and Brett</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:53.730" style="s2">have good stuff has become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.149" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">obvious and so more and more people have</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.730" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">heard of them when you mentioned a book</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:00:59.820" style="s2">you were writing I had a flash of like</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">oh this is actually going to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.820" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">successful book thank you it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">that&#39;s good we&#39;ll start getting you like</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.460" end="00:01:11.070" style="s2">you knew the the Jordan Peterson Kuchar</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.240" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">transformation and if you&#39;ve noticed I</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.070" end="00:01:15.470" style="s2">can you go back and watch his earlier</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">videos he looks like a professor of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.470" end="00:01:20.720" style="s2">psychology and then when you see him in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:33.900" style="s2">the more recent shots he has like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.720" end="00:01:38.579" style="s2">$5,000 suits I really hope that elbow</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.900" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">patches and so the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.579" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">religion yeah so I mean I&#39;ve put a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">of work into that as you as you know are</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">no doubt aware and I&#39;m continue to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:50.220" style="s2">that especially in connection with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">book I just mentioned I made I may take</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.220" end="00:02:00.110" style="s2">physical notes for a second we just grab</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:02:00.110" style="s2">my notebook sure all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.790" end="00:02:09.710" style="s2">so the main they&#39;re the main inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.000" end="00:02:12.770" style="s2">for this idea right is but the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.710" end="00:02:15.410" style="s2">inspiration is I was nici&#39;s madman in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.770" end="00:02:16.670" style="s2">the marketplace right and when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.410" end="00:02:17.600" style="s2">arguing with the atheists that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.670" end="00:02:19.190" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve done when</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.600" end="00:02:21.980" style="s2">they&#39;ve killed God and the idea behind</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.190" end="00:02:23.630" style="s2">that which is which was I read Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.980" end="00:02:25.670" style="s2">a long time ago and my undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.630" end="00:02:30.020" style="s2">years not really something to me very</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.670" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">deeply is that Nietzsche have understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.020" end="00:02:36.260" style="s2">the deep functionality of religion for</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:40.240" style="s2">bringing about a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.260" end="00:02:42.260" style="s2">transformation etc all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.240" end="00:02:46.220" style="s2">what you and I and others are talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.260" end="00:02:48.800" style="s2">about so the there the religion it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.220" end="00:02:52.940" style="s2">a religion it&#39;s one of the things gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.800" end="00:02:54.880" style="s2">require is a very clear and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.940" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">really clear and scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.880" end="00:03:04.670" style="s2">articulated and argued and evidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:07.160" style="s2">explanation of that functionality so as</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.670" end="00:03:09.380" style="s2">opposed to political pseudo religious</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.160" end="00:03:11.450" style="s2">ideologies that just propose a vision of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.380" end="00:03:13.820" style="s2">the promised land and hope that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.450" end="00:03:17.530" style="s2">the functionality will accrue as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.820" end="00:03:20.840" style="s2">commit ourselves to to that utopia I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.530" end="00:03:22.489" style="s2">want to do this in Reverse that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.840" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing that we get the function</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.489" end="00:03:28.010" style="s2">now we know let&#39;s really really really</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.900" end="00:03:31.610" style="s2">understand the functionality and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.010" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">reverse-engineer the practices that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.610" end="00:03:40.280" style="s2">can that activate it and exact it so as</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:47.170" style="s2">to bring about the transformations we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.280" end="00:03:50.690" style="s2">need to achieve individual wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.170" end="00:03:51.950" style="s2">collective coherence so I as I put those</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.690" end="00:03:53.750" style="s2">two now together as you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.950" end="00:03:55.340" style="s2">thinking I have them in it in a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.750" end="00:03:57.050" style="s2">with each other all the time the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.340" end="00:03:59.300" style="s2">medicine the technology that realizes</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.050" end="00:04:01.160" style="s2">coherence and the meta heuristic that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.300" end="00:04:06.320" style="s2">realizes wisdom and they&#39;re together in</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.160" end="00:04:09.170" style="s2">what I&#39;m calling dialectic so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.320" end="00:04:10.760" style="s2">for me that&#39;s that for me that&#39;s I guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.170" end="00:04:12.350" style="s2">to take a stand there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.760" end="00:04:13.010" style="s2">non-negotiable for me that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.350" end="00:04:15.019" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.010" end="00:04:17.209" style="s2">this has got to be you know how you said</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.019" end="00:04:20.380" style="s2">this before and this is something I like</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.209" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">your insistence on this you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.380" end="00:04:25.010" style="s2">the the the rate of complexification is</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:27.740" style="s2">a difference in degree there&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.010" end="00:04:29.810" style="s2">difference in kind and we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.740" end="00:04:31.580" style="s2">fundamentally do things differently this</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">is one of my ways of responding to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.580" end="00:04:36.680" style="s2">desiderata that you have articulated so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:38.690" style="s2">passionately and consistently it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.680" end="00:04:40.850" style="s2">one of the ways in which we can really</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.690" end="00:04:41.960" style="s2">really try to do this differently than</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.850" end="00:04:46.820" style="s2">it&#39;s been done before</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.960" end="00:04:48.440" style="s2">alright is no no instead of leaping into</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.820" end="00:04:50.180" style="s2">the narrative instead of leaping into</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.440" end="00:04:52.370" style="s2">the vision of the promised land instead</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.180" end="00:04:55.130" style="s2">of this is also a bit of their sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.370" end="00:04:57.229" style="s2">the warm hearted of argument I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.130" end="00:04:58.970" style="s2">with Alexander right now right about you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.229" end="00:05:00.770" style="s2">know the phallic vision and all that yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.970" end="00:05:02.440" style="s2">but you know what&#39;s what we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.770" end="00:05:06.050" style="s2">differently this time is let&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.440" end="00:05:08.030" style="s2">understand the functionality first yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.050" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">maybe at some point yes we will need the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.030" end="00:05:10.729" style="s2">artists we need to do that I understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:13.370" style="s2">that I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.729" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">but my point well is you you know to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.370" end="00:05:18.590" style="s2">back to a point I&#39;m making problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:21.020" style="s2">solving good problem formulation is most</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.590" end="00:05:22.789" style="s2">of the heavy work like get the problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.020" end="00:05:25.190" style="s2">formulated really well and then an</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.789" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">essential feature of that I think is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.190" end="00:05:37.630" style="s2">really understand the functionality very</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:41.750" style="s2">deeply yeah and then and only then right</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.630" end="00:05:46.010" style="s2">try to engineer the appropriate sacred</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.750" end="00:05:47.960" style="s2">technology now of course like I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.010" end="00:05:50.539" style="s2">trying to be imperialistic I understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.960" end="00:05:52.130" style="s2">because of the way human creativity work</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.539" end="00:05:54.229" style="s2">and theorizing works and because of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.130" end="00:05:55.760" style="s2">urgency of the situation we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.229" end="00:05:57.380" style="s2">doing both of those things on the fly</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.760" end="00:05:58.699" style="s2">right now a bunch of us right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.380" end="00:06:00.830" style="s2">trying to get at the functionality we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.699" end="00:06:03.020" style="s2">trying to you know reverse engineer the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.830" end="00:06:05.419" style="s2">needed psycho tech I understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.020" end="00:06:07.669" style="s2">but in terms of the ideal epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.419" end="00:06:10.520" style="s2">framing like what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.669" end="00:06:12.860" style="s2">right now the design features that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.520" end="00:06:14.840" style="s2">be I think for me a crucial design</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.860" end="00:06:16.669" style="s2">feature that would make a qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.840" end="00:06:19.550" style="s2">difference from what&#39;s going on before</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.669" end="00:06:22.580" style="s2">and so that way I are trying to see it</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:24.830" style="s2">as a way of you know playing game B as</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.580" end="00:06:26.840" style="s2">opposed to gave me what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.830" end="00:06:30.200" style="s2">change right that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.840" end="00:06:32.090" style="s2">the something fundamental here on how</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.200" end="00:06:35.270" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this so it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.090" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">there&#39;s something about there as part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.270" end="00:06:43.669" style="s2">the design criteria and isometry between</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:48.220" style="s2">the how and the what yes yes yes sir</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.669" end="00:06:48.220" style="s2">there&#39;s something on the lines of a a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.900" end="00:07:02.290" style="s2">plane of a collective individuals</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.470" end="00:07:04.790" style="s2">committed to embodying wisdom and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.290" end="00:07:06.020" style="s2">collaborative exploration of the Medicus</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.790" end="00:07:11.810" style="s2">--tx yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.020" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">and using collective coherence in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.810" end="00:07:16.370" style="s2">collaborative exploration of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">psycho technologies keep going this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.370" end="00:07:23.540" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:25.669" style="s2">to clarify and reify the meta heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.540" end="00:07:30.410" style="s2">and the meta cycler technology and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.669" end="00:07:32.650" style="s2">express the narrative yes yes so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.410" end="00:07:35.930" style="s2">narrative we can almost almost use a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.650" end="00:07:38.870" style="s2">like a checksum to the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.930" end="00:07:42.110" style="s2">the narrative was produced by something</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.870" end="00:07:45.850" style="s2">other than what I was just describing we</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.110" end="00:07:48.140" style="s2">should hold it as being almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.850" end="00:07:49.340" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna actually say wrong but we</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.140" end="00:07:53.030" style="s2">should we should hold it at a distance</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.340" end="00:07:54.530" style="s2">as almost a yeah there&#39;s a problem yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.030" end="00:07:56.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a higher probability that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.530" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">gonna be dysfunctional in addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.539" end="00:08:00.440" style="s2">problems we want to address that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">would put it yeah yeah and there there</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.440" end="00:08:04.700" style="s2">may be useful things there of course of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:05.870" style="s2">course I want to look at it as pastiche</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.700" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">we want to be able to say okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.870" end="00:08:09.169" style="s2">neat that&#39;s nice there&#39;s a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.250" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">stuff there oh that&#39;s funny I just</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.169" end="00:08:12.320" style="s2">flashed it flashed my mind if you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:15.860" style="s2">those beautiful works of art I saw one</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.320" end="00:08:18.950" style="s2">recently there was a an image of Nikola</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.860" end="00:08:21.289" style="s2">Tesla but constructed entirely out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.950" end="00:08:23.150" style="s2">perspective so that if you look at it at</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.289" end="00:08:25.550" style="s2">a very specific angle it looks exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.150" end="00:08:27.020" style="s2">it is the image but if you actually move</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.550" end="00:08:28.910" style="s2">your eye a little bit you see like for</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.020" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">example it&#39;s just a collection of trash</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.910" end="00:08:34.940" style="s2">I haven&#39;t see those that&#39;s amazing to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:38.390" style="s2">you so I had that feeling it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.940" end="00:08:39.979" style="s2">so this a narrative that is constructed</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.390" end="00:08:40.430" style="s2">in a how other than what we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.979" end="00:08:43.340" style="s2">described</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.430" end="00:08:45.110" style="s2">will in fact have a bunch it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.340" end="00:08:48.410" style="s2">tool toolkit I have a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.110" end="00:08:51.140" style="s2">stuff but we should be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.410" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">about that words again and so then at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.140" end="00:08:57.470" style="s2">heuristic level hmm trying to actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">get these things appropriate line um the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.470" end="00:09:01.670" style="s2">stack like the ordering of the stack</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.780" style="s2">from relevance realization up the stack</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.670" end="00:09:05.540" style="s2">in the right order</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.780" end="00:09:08.750" style="s2">yes a bottom-up yeah very much very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.540" end="00:09:10.610" style="s2">that would be for me also another I</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.750" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">think design feature as you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.610" end="00:09:15.800" style="s2">articulated it although I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">implied by the the the notion of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.800" end="00:09:21.530" style="s2">at least the one I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:23.030" style="s2">argue for is that there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.530" end="00:09:24.740" style="s2">the as you put at the alignment of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.030" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">stack from elements realization up</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.740" end="00:09:29.750" style="s2">through the four kinds of knowing both</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:32.300" style="s2">again individually and collectively I</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.750" end="00:09:34.310" style="s2">think there&#39;s you know individually</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.300" end="00:09:35.540" style="s2">collectively and then dialectically</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.310" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">between the individual and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.540" end="00:09:42.470" style="s2">collective and so so I think that would</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:43.280" style="s2">be another important feature so when I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.470" end="00:09:45.230" style="s2">wonder than when we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.280" end="00:09:47.510" style="s2">functionality here we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.230" end="00:09:49.700" style="s2">comprehensive like you said it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.510" end="00:09:52.850" style="s2">the functionality that goes all the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.700" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">up and down the stack and can explain</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.850" end="00:10:04.070" style="s2">and afford its optimization in alignment</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:10:05.300" style="s2">something like that mmm-hmm do you want</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.070" end="00:10:06.740" style="s2">me to just keep all right sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.300" end="00:10:08.840" style="s2">continuing there was stuff I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.740" end="00:10:10.220" style="s2">sort of put in put some thought into or</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.840" end="00:10:16.540" style="s2">do you want to make this more back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.220" end="00:10:16.540" style="s2">forth what would you like hold on sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.650" end="00:10:23.480" style="s2">it&#39;s so funny I almost never take notes</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.130" end="00:10:25.520" style="s2">my entire academic career I think I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.480" end="00:10:28.340" style="s2">like one page of notes well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.520" end="00:10:34.010" style="s2">obviously extremely high in G yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.340" end="00:10:35.420" style="s2">that explains why I&#39;m wondering like as</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.010" end="00:10:37.160" style="s2">I&#39;m doing this the degree to which this</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.420" end="00:10:39.170" style="s2">is really more just a way for me to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.160" end="00:10:40.220" style="s2">clarify my own thinking will I ever flip</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.170" end="00:10:42.290" style="s2">back to these pages and look at these</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.220" end="00:10:44.420" style="s2">notes okay please continue</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.290" end="00:10:45.710" style="s2">yeah it doesn&#39;t matter I often take</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.420" end="00:10:49.880" style="s2">notes for exactly the reason you just</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.710" end="00:10:52.850" style="s2">articulated so for me I mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.880" end="00:10:54.220" style="s2">this the reverse engineering is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.850" end="00:10:56.980" style="s2">reverse what we need an or</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.220" end="00:10:59.830" style="s2">to awaken from the meeting crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.980" end="00:11:04.630" style="s2">then hopefully that will also provide us</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.830" end="00:11:05.770" style="s2">with the state from which we can wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.630" end="00:11:10.090" style="s2">with the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.770" end="00:11:11.980" style="s2">I mean so so I define that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.090" end="00:11:16.060" style="s2">religion that religion has the t loss if</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.980" end="00:11:17.350" style="s2">you want to put it that way of fording</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.060" end="00:11:19.090" style="s2">awakening for the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.350" end="00:11:21.250" style="s2">then as you know as I argue in this here</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.090" end="00:11:23.020" style="s2">is I think there&#39;s two parts to that one</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.250" end="00:11:24.730" style="s2">is it has to give us an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.020" end="00:11:28.090" style="s2">psycho technology that addresses the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.730" end="00:11:33.730" style="s2">perennial problems and then the other is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.090" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">it has to it has to work out the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.730" end="00:11:40.990" style="s2">symbolic mythos that religions do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">aligns with the scientific worldview you</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.990" end="00:11:44.470" style="s2">know and is aligned with the best</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:46.750" style="s2">cognitive science the best neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.470" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">the best machine learning the best the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.750" end="00:11:54.280" style="s2">best right the very very best so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:56.700" style="s2">the ecology of practices sits within a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.280" end="00:12:00.280" style="s2">world of you that legitimates it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.700" end="00:12:03.250" style="s2">authorizes it and I would actually push</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.280" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">it one level harder which is that by an</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.250" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">align what I would say is to think like</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.410" end="00:12:13.870" style="s2">Claire applies so it&#39;s in alliance with</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.210" end="00:12:15.310" style="s2">and therefore clarify so the work that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.870" end="00:12:19.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve see you do a lot of is actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.310" end="00:12:20.980" style="s2">taking concepts that in many ways have</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.030" end="00:12:23.620" style="s2">been sort of pulled rough-hewn and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.980" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">littered with nonsense into any</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.620" end="00:12:26.470" style="s2">discipline cognitive science means</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:28.360" style="s2">whether you&#39;re focusing on and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.470" end="00:12:30.670" style="s2">taking a very careful look at them and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.360" end="00:12:34.410" style="s2">clarifying them so that the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.670" end="00:12:37.030" style="s2">itself is actually disciplined in it oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.410" end="00:12:39.520" style="s2">yeah right right right right that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.030" end="00:12:40.900" style="s2">well said yeah that&#39;s very good I like</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.520" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.900" end="00:12:45.700" style="s2">that&#39;s good I&#39;m glad we were recording</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:50.400" style="s2">this I expect they&#39;ll be more insights</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.700" end="00:12:53.589" style="s2">like that okay so check this okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.400" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">Forrest Landry you&#39;ve mentioned him</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.589" end="00:13:00.580" style="s2">before so he&#39;s done a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">powerful work and the interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.580" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">Athena just blew my mind was the way at</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:08.590" style="s2">the path that he took his work he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:11.890" style="s2">polymath</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.590" end="00:13:14.620" style="s2">with the deep history actually in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.890" end="00:13:17.140" style="s2">remain so in Yankee would crafting like</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.620" end="00:13:20.170" style="s2">his father was a an actual guild master</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.140" end="00:13:23.260" style="s2">woodworker and for school up but his</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.170" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">background is fundamentally is in his</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.260" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">computer science like theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">computer science and sentiment and his</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:35.170" style="s2">area of practice was was it is semantic</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:37.690" style="s2">computing and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.170" end="00:13:39.279" style="s2">he did he was working in really</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.690" end="00:13:41.260" style="s2">sophisticated cemented computing back</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.279" end="00:13:44.620" style="s2">back back when the internet was just</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.260" end="00:13:46.570" style="s2">coming online this is back when very</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.620" end="00:13:48.010" style="s2">little noise and a decently large amount</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.570" end="00:13:49.960" style="s2">of signal was actually being generated</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.010" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">in terms of semantically processed</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.960" end="00:13:57.460" style="s2">computer readable content like saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:14:01.089" style="s2">every scientific journal and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.460" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">the first archive of books digital books</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.089" end="00:14:04.420" style="s2">was actually put online I camber where</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:06.339" style="s2">it was it was like a huge archive of all</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.420" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">the non copyrighted books which is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.339" end="00:14:11.110" style="s2">huge motivator so he began running</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:14.290" style="s2">semantic processing on this treasure</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.110" end="00:14:16.270" style="s2">trove and then began tuning his semantic</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.290" end="00:14:18.550" style="s2">processing using this treasure trove and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.270" end="00:14:21.460" style="s2">then so doing a lot of this work so take</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.550" end="00:14:24.550" style="s2">a concept like transcendence right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.460" end="00:14:26.980" style="s2">actually see you know given the so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.550" end="00:14:30.370" style="s2">use of transcendence in many disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.980" end="00:14:32.410" style="s2">as you can grab as many locations what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:32.410" end="00:14:36.630" style="s2">concept what is it what does the word</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.030" end="00:14:39.240" style="s2">mean in a fundamentally deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.630" end="00:14:42.400" style="s2">because you just said the best of</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.400" end="00:14:45.190" style="s2">what I would say is that we can really</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.990" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">do this from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.190" end="00:14:50.589" style="s2">participatory knowing meaning it should</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.270" end="00:15:02.950" style="s2">there&#39;s not a religion of computer</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.850" end="00:15:05.529" style="s2">science what would computer science say</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.950" end="00:15:08.290" style="s2">they compute event and say oh well why</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.529" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">don&#39;t we let the computer help why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.290" end="00:15:14.709" style="s2">we take this variation of a the problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:18.580" style="s2">of getting clarity in the semantic space</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.709" end="00:15:21.040" style="s2">and automate that a computer argue that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.580" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">all right good oh this - can it can</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.040" end="00:15:24.009" style="s2">simplify dramatic yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:27.009" style="s2">yeah whoo he did that work already</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.009" end="00:15:28.689" style="s2">that&#39;s been done well I should we should</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.009" end="00:15:30.489" style="s2">definitely think I&#39;d like to know how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.689" end="00:15:33.009" style="s2">make use of that that sounds like a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.489" end="00:15:36.609" style="s2">powerful thing integrating that with</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.009" end="00:15:38.230" style="s2">sort of you know dialogic exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.609" end="00:15:40.629" style="s2">concepts like you see in the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.230" end="00:15:41.109" style="s2">dialogues would be a very powerful thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.629" end="00:15:43.269" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.109" end="00:15:46.419" style="s2">yeah you know where the computer might</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.269" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">be one of the participants in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.419" end="00:15:54.220" style="s2">dialogic process itself yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:57.339" style="s2">exactly and it&#39;s we can get there you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.220" end="00:15:58.600" style="s2">can get a well you can get a lot you</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.339" end="00:16:00.309" style="s2">think it&#39;s very touching stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.600" end="00:16:03.489" style="s2">just popped into my head so I&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.309" end="00:16:08.910" style="s2">no I don&#39;t believe so no but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.489" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">great and the more we can see how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.910" end="00:16:16.029" style="s2">well use this word exact the cyber</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:17.889" style="s2">technology so it you know integrates</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.029" end="00:16:21.100" style="s2">with the psycho technology the better</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.889" end="00:16:22.600" style="s2">the more we need to do that I agree so</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.100" end="00:16:24.759" style="s2">here&#39;s an example this is a great one so</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.600" end="00:16:28.209" style="s2">one of the things that the religions</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.759" end="00:16:34.049" style="s2">tend to fall into is the semantic</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.209" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">complexity right and so you get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.049" end="00:16:38.169" style="s2">oftentimes unintentional often times in</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:40.899" style="s2">tension but a lot of fun unintentional</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.169" end="00:16:46.319" style="s2">equivocation yes as the semantic</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.899" end="00:16:49.029" style="s2">distance leads people to lose this</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.319" end="00:16:51.399" style="s2">coherence at the level of Arkham entity</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.029" end="00:16:53.439" style="s2">for rational coherence right across</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.399" end="00:16:56.019" style="s2">there the domain that they&#39;re inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.439" end="00:16:57.639" style="s2">into so I might struggle really really</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.019" end="00:16:59.769" style="s2">hard to have a high degree of rigor and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.639" end="00:17:04.149" style="s2">coherence in the conceptual frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.769" end="00:17:06.789" style="s2">that I&#39;m using but as I&#39;m ingesting more</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.149" end="00:17:08.740" style="s2">and more conceptual frameworks the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.789" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">that my mind is able to hold them begins</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.740" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">a process of sort of partitioning them</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.630" end="00:17:15.159" style="s2">into shards so I might have lots of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:17.019" style="s2">say transcendence and I might bury</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.159" end="00:17:19.029" style="s2">myself be holding it equivocal into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.019" end="00:17:20.919" style="s2">three or distinct meanings because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.029" end="00:17:22.899" style="s2">got the Nietzschean lineage over here</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.919" end="00:17:24.039" style="s2">and I&#39;ve got sort of a very early for</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.899" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">the logic lineage and those are</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.039" end="00:17:28.569" style="s2">connected but not exactly the same and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:29.860" style="s2">you fill in the blank and of course as</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.569" end="00:17:33.549" style="s2">soon as you add more people into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.860" end="00:17:36.039" style="s2">conversation the level of equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.549" end="00:17:36.340" style="s2">and the amount of complexity goes up so</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.039" end="00:17:39.010" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.340" end="00:17:41.170" style="s2">that by definition that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.010" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">point no human mind can actually hold</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.170" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">the semantic space but a computer can</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">and so you can run into a situation</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:49.300" style="s2">where it&#39;s actually a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.650" end="00:17:51.460" style="s2">equivocation happening here something in</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.300" end="00:17:54.010" style="s2">the in the conversational space there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.460" end="00:17:57.370" style="s2">a meaning cross you&#39;re crossing terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.010" end="00:17:59.380" style="s2">and could help reify the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.370" end="00:18:03.400" style="s2">something like that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.380" end="00:18:06.460" style="s2">brilliant if we could engineer that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.400" end="00:18:10.510" style="s2">would be a bead like that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.460" end="00:18:14.530" style="s2">powerful step up yeah yeah are you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.510" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">familiar with some bonito Roy&#39;s stuff a</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.530" end="00:18:18.850" style="s2">little bit there she introduced me to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.230" end="00:18:20.230" style="s2">very simple from a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.850" end="00:18:22.990" style="s2">psychological notion of the mapping</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.230" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">error which is so helpful when people</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.990" end="00:18:26.140" style="s2">are in a moving up the stack it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:27.400" style="s2">basically many ways it&#39;s a reverse</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.140" end="00:18:30.100" style="s2">getting people back into the right order</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.400" end="00:18:31.690" style="s2">on the stack yeah right if you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.100" end="00:18:32.980" style="s2">transcendence and I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.690" end="00:18:35.770" style="s2">transcendence so what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.980" end="00:18:38.680" style="s2">confuses and maybe angers me as a first</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.770" end="00:18:40.090" style="s2">move is it a mapping your issue you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.680" end="00:18:41.170" style="s2">pointing to something down stack you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.090" end="00:18:44.440" style="s2">supporting something the level of say</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.170" end="00:18:45.910" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s effective and I&#39;m you know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.440" end="00:18:48.280" style="s2">need to slow down and actually take that</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.910" end="00:18:50.380" style="s2">step all right sorry I wonder too far</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.280" end="00:18:52.660" style="s2">afield there no no you didn&#39;t I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.380" end="00:18:56.140" style="s2">that&#39;s good no no I think that&#39;s good I</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.660" end="00:18:59.560" style="s2">think that idea well first of all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.140" end="00:19:01.900" style="s2">idea of entry level equivocation I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.560" end="00:19:04.780" style="s2">is important I think that shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.900" end="00:19:06.730" style="s2">cognitive science a lot information is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.780" end="00:19:10.750" style="s2">term that&#39;s often used equivocally</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.730" end="00:19:14.410" style="s2">across the levels are very much so if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.750" end="00:19:17.380" style="s2">could pick up if if we could if we could</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.410" end="00:19:22.090" style="s2">co-opt some of this existing cyber</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.380" end="00:19:27.750" style="s2">technology to help us enhance our you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.090" end="00:19:31.110" style="s2">know our reflective capacity to avoid</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.110" end="00:19:35.170" style="s2">if we can make that happen I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.040" end="00:19:36.910" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s also that&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.170" end="00:19:37.690" style="s2">qualitative changes that could make a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.910" end="00:19:40.930" style="s2">real difference</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.690" end="00:19:44.410" style="s2">if imagine imagine if there was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.930" end="00:19:46.210" style="s2">a cyborg rationality in which the human</p>

<p begin="00:19:46.210" end="00:19:49.990" style="s2">insight were wedded to this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.990" end="00:19:55.630" style="s2">check right and like you know and do</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.250" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">something you know almost like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.630" end="00:19:59.110" style="s2">not on an internet search and say well</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:00.909" style="s2">here&#39;s possible equivocations they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.110" end="00:20:02.740" style="s2">making you so and then the human being</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.909" end="00:20:04.179" style="s2">sort of talk about it and oh yeah we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.740" end="00:20:06.789" style="s2">equivocating here no that&#39;s irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.179" end="00:20:10.450" style="s2">that&#39;s right and then but to think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.789" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">how much time wait how much wasted time</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.450" end="00:20:17.230" style="s2">would be avoided doing that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:23.289" style="s2">a very good idea yeah yeah I&#39;m noticing</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.230" end="00:20:24.659" style="s2">a attention in myself part of me wants</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.289" end="00:20:26.590" style="s2">to continue exploring down this road</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.659" end="00:20:31.110" style="s2">heard me is worried that it&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.590" end="00:20:31.110" style="s2">weed but maybe there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.580" end="00:20:37.510" style="s2">yeah okay if I open the context and say</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.890" end="00:20:40.210" style="s2">perhaps the thing that feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.510" end="00:20:42.970" style="s2">going into the weeds can be held as an</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.210" end="00:20:44.980" style="s2">example of a more general thing I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.970" end="00:20:46.809" style="s2">gonna about to say exactly that I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.980" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">the more general thing is and with that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.809" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">that&#39;s an example a clear example that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:53.770" style="s2">it gives teeth to the idea of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:56.590" style="s2">design features of the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.770" end="00:20:58.539" style="s2">not a religion is exactly this that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.590" end="00:21:01.960" style="s2">is going to find the best way to not</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.539" end="00:22:25.629" style="s2">because it was dealing now with hundreds</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.370" end="00:22:34.789" style="s2">from French to the meta language and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.049" end="00:22:36.590" style="s2">from the meta language to English the</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.059" end="00:22:51.379" style="s2">yeah yeah but yeah but that&#39;s a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.309" end="00:22:57.139" style="s2">analogy though that&#39;s a powerful analogy</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.379" end="00:22:59.450" style="s2">okay yeah that&#39;s very good so okay I I</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.139" end="00:23:01.850" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s very good so</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.450" end="00:23:08.570" style="s2">the the idea yeah that these machines</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.850" end="00:23:10.129" style="s2">can do that kind of thing and help if</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.570" end="00:23:11.929" style="s2">you do so they can do one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.129" end="00:23:13.610" style="s2">sorry they can do two things in</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.929" end="00:23:15.769" style="s2">integrative fashion one thing they can</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.610" end="00:23:19.000" style="s2">do is they can explicate how the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.769" end="00:23:21.799" style="s2">machinery we&#39;re using might be you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.000" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">internally self-deceptive like your</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.799" end="00:23:27.889" style="s2">example of equivocation and they can</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:29.870" style="s2">also afford giving us you know quicker</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.889" end="00:23:33.230" style="s2">and more comprehensive access to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.870" end="00:23:35.509" style="s2">meta space we might need to make use of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.230" end="00:23:37.279" style="s2">exactly exactly quicker and more complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.509" end="00:23:40.519" style="s2">if you access to the meta space yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.279" end="00:23:42.710" style="s2">perfect okay so okay that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.519" end="00:23:44.059" style="s2">and so kind of sliding to the right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.710" end="00:23:45.649" style="s2">this feels like it&#39;s a bucket that will</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.059" end="00:23:50.419" style="s2">have to be dealt with at some point and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.649" end="00:23:52.429" style="s2">we can kind of name it the the pet tag</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.419" end="00:23:56.990" style="s2">Peggy ow Peggy Peggy a bucket</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.429" end="00:23:58.220" style="s2">hey Jo hi Jo right we leave to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.990" end="00:24:00.110" style="s2">degree to which we&#39;re endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.220" end="00:24:01.309" style="s2">create a religion that is not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.110" end="00:24:09.409" style="s2">how do we do with the religions in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.309" end="00:24:11.869" style="s2">religion and the Pantheon and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.409" end="00:24:13.460" style="s2">wondering I mean I&#39;m curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.869" end="00:24:16.279" style="s2">degree to which we could actually find</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.460" end="00:24:17.360" style="s2">that there is a meta structure that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.279" end="00:24:20.570" style="s2">would actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.360" end="00:24:22.190" style="s2">yeah our conversation to occur look just</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.570" end="00:24:24.350" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s a translation now this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.190" end="00:24:26.390" style="s2">actually put interesting if I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.350" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">if I were a Sufi Muslim having a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.390" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">conversation with the presbyterian in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:32.690" style="s2">english we&#39;re under a very significant</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:33.890" style="s2">illusion that we&#39;re actually having a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.690" end="00:24:36.770" style="s2">conversation about the same things</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.890" end="00:24:39.800" style="s2">because you&#39;re using a language English</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.770" end="00:24:42.010" style="s2">yeah and I can translate my rear</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.800" end="00:24:45.140" style="s2">elephants realization and body</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.010" end="00:24:46.700" style="s2">sensibilities into English convey it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.140" end="00:24:49.160" style="s2">semantically across you to English</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.700" end="00:24:50.900" style="s2">whereupon you can reverse decompose that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.160" end="00:24:53.210" style="s2">into something that seems relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.900" end="00:24:54.920" style="s2">you and get very confused there</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:24:56.150" style="s2">very much sure but if your applicator</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.920" end="00:24:57.800" style="s2">will say no no we can do a Google</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.150" end="00:24:59.540" style="s2">Translate we can actually identify is</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.800" end="00:25:01.970" style="s2">there a meta structure that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.540" end="00:25:03.770" style="s2">the meta not expressed in any given</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.970" end="00:25:05.540" style="s2">language or at least reified into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.770" end="00:25:08.030" style="s2">computational construct that has access</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.540" end="00:25:09.680" style="s2">to the meta then do the up and sideways</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.030" end="00:25:12.380" style="s2">we may actually find that a very large</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.680" end="00:25:14.450" style="s2">number of doctrinal disagreement is in</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.380" end="00:25:17.060" style="s2">fact simple confusion at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.450" end="00:25:18.830" style="s2">semantics that&#39;s that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.060" end="00:25:23.450" style="s2">very good that aligns with something</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.830" end="00:25:25.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve been playing with which is the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.450" end="00:25:28.670" style="s2">alternative to Huxley&#39;s perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.430" end="00:25:30.760" style="s2">right so you know how you know how in</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.670" end="00:25:33.260" style="s2">deep learning you cycle through sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.760" end="00:25:35.720" style="s2">compression you compress you try to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.260" end="00:25:38.330" style="s2">extract what&#39;s invariant across and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.720" end="00:25:39.980" style="s2">and then you then you vary and send it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.330" end="00:25:41.810" style="s2">back up to the variations that interact</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.980" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">with the environment and come back and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.810" end="00:25:45.800" style="s2">was thinking well instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:48.230" style="s2">do what Huxley did was just find you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.800" end="00:25:49.700" style="s2">know the commonalities what if we did</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.230" end="00:25:51.170" style="s2">something like machine learning on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.700" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">various religions where they cycle</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.170" end="00:25:56.030" style="s2">through compression right getting like</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:58.160" style="s2">you say abstracting this sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.030" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">meta there may be the core meta language</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.160" end="00:26:02.570" style="s2">or the grammar right cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:05.510" style="s2">but then they allow themselves to verify</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.570" end="00:26:07.040" style="s2">out sorry two very out and then interact</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.510" end="00:26:09.050" style="s2">with the in with the environment in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.040" end="00:26:11.330" style="s2">particular context and then come back in</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.050" end="00:26:13.190" style="s2">and so what did it actually cycles</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.330" end="00:26:15.680" style="s2">instead of saying you know instead of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.190" end="00:26:16.700" style="s2">saying either perennialism all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.680" end="00:26:19.790" style="s2">religions have always said the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.700" end="00:26:20.990" style="s2">thing or relativism no there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.790" end="00:26:23.780" style="s2">completely different world there&#39;s no no</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.990" end="00:26:25.640" style="s2">what we can do is we can exact this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.780" end="00:26:26.930" style="s2">as a deep learning cycle which we cycle</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.640" end="00:26:29.330" style="s2">between compression and particular</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.930" end="00:26:31.220" style="s2">ization so that the whole thing right</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.330" end="00:26:33.289" style="s2">right the whole process</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.220" end="00:26:35.150" style="s2">getting better yeah that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.289" end="00:26:36.620" style="s2">interesting because I think if you did</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.150" end="00:26:37.669" style="s2">that and I think we can do that by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.620" end="00:26:42.950" style="s2">way I think technically that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.669" end="00:26:46.580" style="s2">available you might notice for example a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.950" end="00:26:49.100" style="s2">natural topology in the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:51.350" style="s2">landscape of religion space yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.100" end="00:26:54.580" style="s2">I think you&#39;re me and I could be like</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.350" end="00:26:57.080" style="s2">say three saddle nodes and there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.580" end="00:26:58.669" style="s2">three the variations on that like</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.080" end="00:26:59.929" style="s2">Buddhism might be sitting over here and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.669" end="00:27:02.360" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.929" end="00:27:03.380" style="s2">Islam is sitting over here and Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.360" end="00:27:05.090" style="s2">is sitting over here and there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.380" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">distinction between them but we can now</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.090" end="00:27:07.190" style="s2">actually talk about what those new</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:09.320" style="s2">distinctions are like what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.190" end="00:27:11.630" style="s2">really are it&#39;s a okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.320" end="00:27:13.010" style="s2">now now that we have that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.630" end="00:27:15.710" style="s2">very powerful and interesting I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.010" end="00:27:17.539" style="s2">sure well no it seems very doable so as</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.710" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">long as we&#39;re just doing the design</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.539" end="00:27:25.100" style="s2">there seems to be something that would</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:28.429" style="s2">be ah so as a design criteria for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.100" end="00:27:33.020" style="s2">religion religion in fact actually be</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.429" end="00:27:35.539" style="s2">used yes yes yes that&#39;s for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.020" end="00:27:37.190" style="s2">ideally has to actually be used in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.539" end="00:27:41.240" style="s2">way that you described it meaning it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.190" end="00:27:43.850" style="s2">provides us with the the basis from</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.240" end="00:27:52.909" style="s2">which we can collectively address the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.850" end="00:27:54.980" style="s2">meta-crisis so I&#39;ve noticed that trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.909" end="00:27:56.690" style="s2">to articulate my relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.980" end="00:28:00.380" style="s2">existing religions is sort of best</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.690" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">explained in what I just said to you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.380" end="00:28:03.110" style="s2">not claiming to have the computational</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">power we would need to do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.110" end="00:28:09.140" style="s2">comprehensively but I&#39;m saying in terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:11.169" style="s2">of my own individual practice because</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.140" end="00:28:13.970" style="s2">this is how I sort of try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.169" end="00:28:17.870" style="s2">how I was alternative to both you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.970" end="00:28:20.179" style="s2">cats and to Huxley it was like no no</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.870" end="00:28:21.950" style="s2">what I do is I I do things where I do</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.179" end="00:28:24.230" style="s2">that I get sort of the compressive stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.950" end="00:28:26.990" style="s2">and then and then I see how the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.230" end="00:28:29.390" style="s2">variations go out to apply to more</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.990" end="00:28:32.600" style="s2">context-sensitive and I cycle that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.390" end="00:28:34.549" style="s2">and what I was noticing is but I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.600" end="00:28:36.230" style="s2">how accurate this is but it seemed to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.549" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">that what was happening is rather than</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.230" end="00:28:41.299" style="s2">getting you know your conviction in any</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:43.309" style="s2">particular order religion my overall</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.299" end="00:28:46.030" style="s2">capacities for relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.309" end="00:28:52.220" style="s2">were being enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.030" end="00:28:53.690" style="s2">mmm-hmm which is part of the meta both</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.220" end="00:28:56.809" style="s2">the mini heuristic and the meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.690" end="00:29:02.570" style="s2">psycho tech exactly exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.809" end="00:29:04.429" style="s2">exactly so I have another design feature</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.570" end="00:29:06.770" style="s2">that I think is very relevant and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.429" end="00:29:09.410" style="s2">been brought up I think both by Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.770" end="00:29:11.780" style="s2">and most clearly I think by Paul which</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.410" end="00:29:14.170" style="s2">is the scalability issue and you and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.780" end="00:29:17.350" style="s2">have as also talked about that at times</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.170" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">because part of the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.350" end="00:29:22.100" style="s2">religions as opposed to other things and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:23.510" style="s2">an interesting thing historically is you</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.100" end="00:29:25.610" style="s2">can sort of compare Christianity to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.510" end="00:29:29.059" style="s2">stoicism on this and you can see ways in</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.610" end="00:29:30.740" style="s2">which they succeeded and failed to win</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.059" end="00:29:33.800" style="s2">the Roman Empire we want to put it that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.740" end="00:29:35.420" style="s2">way so Paul&#39;s idea is you know for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.800" end="00:29:37.670" style="s2">religion to bring about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.420" end="00:29:39.470" style="s2">transformation that we seek from it</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.670" end="00:29:41.860" style="s2">which is I assume what we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.470" end="00:29:45.710" style="s2">seeking it has to be scalable both</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.860" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">between levels of socio economic socio</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.710" end="00:29:50.900" style="s2">political organization and that has to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:54.290" style="s2">be scalable across developmental stages</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.900" end="00:29:57.170" style="s2">so from bullying from adult to child</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.290" end="00:30:01.130" style="s2">right because if you don&#39;t have if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.170" end="00:30:02.090" style="s2">don&#39;t have the societal integration if</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.130" end="00:30:04.010" style="s2">you don&#39;t have the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.090" end="00:30:05.660" style="s2">integration you do not you do not have</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.010" end="00:30:07.280" style="s2">access to the deep functionality that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.660" end="00:30:09.350" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.280" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">a I think that&#39;s a very very good point</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.350" end="00:30:13.490" style="s2">I take that criticism that Paul has made</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:15.890" style="s2">of my work very seriously I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.490" end="00:30:18.020" style="s2">a very good point I think that I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.890" end="00:30:23.630" style="s2">it&#39;s I think we I think we can address</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.020" end="00:30:26.440" style="s2">that I met Zack yes yes we might say</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.630" end="00:30:29.059" style="s2">that his life&#39;s work has been there</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.440" end="00:30:34.400" style="s2">really deeply grasping the whole notion</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.059" end="00:30:35.390" style="s2">of development right and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.400" end="00:30:41.059" style="s2">about the essence of what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.390" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">about we can actually actually invert</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.059" end="00:30:47.270" style="s2">the challenge and turn it into a leader</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:51.490" style="s2">okay one of the things we&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.270" end="00:30:55.370" style="s2">for example is to actually in body</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.490" end="00:30:58.610" style="s2">through through the use of the medic</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.370" end="00:31:01.429" style="s2">eristic s-- increase</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.610" end="00:31:02.750" style="s2">visual wisdom mmm well if I just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.429" end="00:31:04.429" style="s2">flipped my head around and say well that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.750" end="00:31:08.330" style="s2">just sounds like good parenting and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.429" end="00:31:12.740" style="s2">education I&#39;m starting with you probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.330" end="00:31:14.360" style="s2">18 months before birth and ending well I</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.740" end="00:31:16.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know how where you end exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.360" end="00:31:17.630" style="s2">because lineage becomes a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.040" end="00:31:20.740" style="s2">challenging thing cats getting Apple</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.630" end="00:31:23.809" style="s2">it&#39;s just ended it shortly after death</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.740" end="00:31:25.670" style="s2">the specifics the specificity of the</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.170" end="00:31:35.720" style="s2">the developmental arc yes into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.809" end="00:31:38.390" style="s2">severity of the individual right so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.720" end="00:31:39.650" style="s2">is a second-order but this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.390" end="00:31:41.929" style="s2">nonetheless a very strong because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.650" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">design criteria which is the religion</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.929" end="00:31:46.610" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion is bound to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:48.830" style="s2">specificity of the developmental art and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.610" end="00:31:51.799" style="s2">to the singularity of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.830" end="00:31:56.210" style="s2">that&#39;s well said I like that I like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.799" end="00:31:59.179" style="s2">that&#39;s very good there&#39;s a when you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.210" end="00:32:02.570" style="s2">scalability the the third criteria is</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.179" end="00:32:05.090" style="s2">something along the lines of it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.570" end="00:32:07.220" style="s2">I&#39;m actually popping into the into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.090" end="00:32:10.040" style="s2">computational and even technological</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.220" end="00:32:11.780" style="s2">domain for the word scalability I said</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.040" end="00:32:16.570" style="s2">yeah scale of there was a technical</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.780" end="00:32:22.090" style="s2">sense means that I must be able to add</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.570" end="00:32:25.100" style="s2">increasing service arbitrarily without</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.090" end="00:32:28.280" style="s2">decreasing the functionality of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.100" end="00:32:29.179" style="s2">service to be scalable yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.280" end="00:32:32.169" style="s2">I like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.179" end="00:32:34.700" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s an excellent way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.169" end="00:32:36.590" style="s2">defining that let&#39;s don&#39;t know I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.700" end="00:32:39.950" style="s2">that&#39;s very useful then I can fishing</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.590" end="00:32:42.230" style="s2">Metcalfe&#39;s law which is Metcalfe&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.950" end="00:32:45.020" style="s2">is to say so make make Hess law is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.230" end="00:32:47.179" style="s2">very powerful observation which appears</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.020" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">to actually not be grounded in some</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.179" end="00:32:55.820" style="s2">fundamental reality which is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:59.030" style="s2">add a node to a communications graph</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.820" end="00:33:01.340" style="s2">like say a telephone network the value</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.030" end="00:33:07.429" style="s2">as measured in the possibility space of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.340" end="00:33:10.700" style="s2">the communications network expands the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.429" end="00:33:12.500" style="s2">word is a mathematical term that I just</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.700" end="00:33:16.430" style="s2">lost just flew in my head it&#39;s trippy</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.500" end="00:33:17.750" style="s2">Oh a novela okay many people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.430" end="00:33:19.550" style="s2">just call it exponential it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.750" end="00:33:20.900" style="s2">exponential but nonetheless it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.550" end="00:33:24.050" style="s2">a nice curve though</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.900" end="00:33:25.970" style="s2">so what Metcalfe&#39;s law does is it drives</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.050" end="00:33:28.160" style="s2">the rapid explosion something like say</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.970" end="00:33:29.780" style="s2">Facebook very rare if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.160" end="00:33:32.230" style="s2">social media I think about Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.780" end="00:33:35.150" style="s2">Facebook t 0 is just Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.230" end="00:33:37.040" style="s2">right just hit the value of Facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.150" end="00:33:38.630" style="s2">very look and in fact if I have Mark</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.040" end="00:33:40.490" style="s2">Zuckerberg in his roommate still very</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.630" end="00:33:42.740" style="s2">low but as you start getting two three</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.490" end="00:33:46.430" style="s2">four five six seven people that value</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.740" end="00:33:48.890" style="s2">actually expands at some number larger</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.430" end="00:33:51.320" style="s2">than the end right right well that&#39;s met</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.890" end="00:33:54.170" style="s2">a scalable right to degree which I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.320" end="00:33:57.680" style="s2">craft a techno tech nickel layer so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.170" end="00:33:59.800" style="s2">people can conjoin I can scale the</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.800" end="00:34:04.340" style="s2">without decreasing the availability of</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.810" end="00:34:17.330" style="s2">increases both the value of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.900" end="00:34:21.260" style="s2">and therefore also the attractions you</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.730" end="00:34:26.270" style="s2">that&#39;s scaled what in that sense meta</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.230" end="00:34:28.580" style="s2">scaleable then you would expect to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.270" end="00:34:30.590" style="s2">something on the on the order of an</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.590" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">actually resolve the practicality</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.030" end="00:34:35.510" style="s2">problem but actually needs no it needs</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:36.950" style="s2">to be adopted it needs to be adopted and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.510" end="00:34:38.650" style="s2">adopted in a way that actually helps us</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.950" end="00:34:40.610" style="s2">resolve the meta-crisis</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.650" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">that know that makes that makes</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.610" end="00:34:46.400" style="s2">excellent sense that&#39;s very good I like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:47.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s very very helpful notice I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.400" end="00:34:51.230" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.800" end="00:34:55.250" style="s2">so with that so that this is an open</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.230" end="00:34:58.940" style="s2">question right would that mean a that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.250" end="00:35:00.350" style="s2">the way things I&#39;m thinking of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.940" end="00:35:02.840" style="s2">scientists working with the rover on</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.350" end="00:35:04.730" style="s2">Mars and they they do not adopt a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.840" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">hierarchical structure when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.730" end="00:35:09.170" style="s2">trying to move into this new environment</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:11.990" style="s2">they socially organize the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.170" end="00:35:14.030" style="s2">cognition much more like a dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.990" end="00:35:15.890" style="s2">reconfiguring small world network that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.030" end="00:35:19.130" style="s2">constantly be structuring itself rather</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.890" end="00:35:20.660" style="s2">than an Iron Age hierarchy so be good</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.130" end="00:35:21.950" style="s2">because what was it occurring to me as</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.660" end="00:35:23.150" style="s2">you said that is I thought well how did</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.950" end="00:35:25.250" style="s2">the religion in the past deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.150" end="00:35:26.660" style="s2">well they used Iron Age hierarchy that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.250" end="00:35:29.720" style="s2">was their way of trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.660" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">to manage what you&#39;re talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.720" end="00:35:34.940" style="s2">it seems to me that if we have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:37.849" style="s2">science and and the technology and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.940" end="00:35:42.109" style="s2">especially the cyber technology we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.849" end="00:35:46.549" style="s2">have to address that problem manage it</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.109" end="00:35:48.589" style="s2">with an Iron Age hierarchy right well</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.549" end="00:35:50.210" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a reasonable implication</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.589" end="00:35:52.460" style="s2">to draw there&#39;s a very reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.210" end="00:35:54.410" style="s2">implication but I would say you probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.460" end="00:36:01.460" style="s2">go to more steps and discover that it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.410" end="00:36:04.339" style="s2">actually going to be how do I say this</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.460" end="00:36:06.829" style="s2">right there&#39;s a series of steps that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.339" end="00:36:11.539" style="s2">lead you to conclude that it is almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.829" end="00:36:13.700" style="s2">certainly a necessity a necessity in</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.539" end="00:36:15.799" style="s2">terms of network design it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.700" end="00:36:17.329" style="s2">a network design necessity if you want</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.799" end="00:36:19.309" style="s2">to do the thing that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.329" end="00:36:21.319" style="s2">in terms of the design criteria you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.309" end="00:36:23.480" style="s2">begin to prune all the different network</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.319" end="00:36:24.500" style="s2">designs that you might use there and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.480" end="00:36:26.180" style="s2">begin to realize that this network</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.500" end="00:36:28.190" style="s2">design is the only network design that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.180" end="00:36:30.770" style="s2">actually satisfies the design criteria</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.190" end="00:36:31.849" style="s2">right very good and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.770" end="00:36:34.940" style="s2">interested right now I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.849" end="00:36:42.260" style="s2">holding this flip back and forth into</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.940" end="00:36:43.789" style="s2">metastasis what&#39;s happening there okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.260" end="00:36:45.140" style="s2">so let me see if I can just narrate the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.789" end="00:36:48.490" style="s2">story that&#39;s playing out in my head and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.140" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">see if there&#39;s something about please</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.490" end="00:36:52.069" style="s2">yeah I guess I was synthesizing a couple</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:54.770" style="s2">of different conversations that we had</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.069" end="00:36:57.859" style="s2">so I had a population of humans</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.770" end="00:36:59.630" style="s2">partitioned into at least two distinct</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.859" end="00:37:02.029" style="s2">kinds of groups one kind of group was</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.630" end="00:37:04.069" style="s2">partitioned around language so French</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.029" end="00:37:05.859" style="s2">speakers and English speakers and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.069" end="00:37:17.270" style="s2">other kind of was partitioned around</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.859" end="00:37:19.039" style="s2">existing cuido I suppose and then what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.270" end="00:37:21.170" style="s2">was and then I guess the third variable</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.039" end="00:37:24.950" style="s2">was a differential allocation of meta</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.170" end="00:37:27.339" style="s2">processing capacity oh ok say more about</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.950" end="00:37:36.410" style="s2">that please there were some people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.339" end="00:37:39.049" style="s2">were naturally skillful in operating in</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.410" end="00:37:40.970" style="s2">meta space the capacity to perceive meta</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.049" end="00:37:45.650" style="s2">structures and then to be able to move</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.970" end="00:37:50.140" style="s2">from the meta to the concrete was at a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.650" end="00:37:52.940" style="s2">higher level higher copper where and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.140" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">what I was noticing is that the ability</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.940" end="00:37:57.140" style="s2">to engage there&#39;s a distinct there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:59.720" style="s2">like a network tamal topology they seem</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.140" end="00:38:01.130" style="s2">to be emerging out of this this comes</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.720" end="00:38:04.430" style="s2">from this these three distinct</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.130" end="00:38:07.220" style="s2">characteristics which was a something</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.430" end="00:38:11.020" style="s2">like a collaboration happening between</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.220" end="00:38:12.920" style="s2">an among and among the more meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.020" end="00:38:17.780" style="s2">individuals which I guess we might even</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.920" end="00:38:19.580" style="s2">flag a shaman just as kind of yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.780" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">very importantly there was like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.580" end="00:38:23.390" style="s2">conversation and collaboration between</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:26.680" style="s2">and among the meta individuals the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.390" end="00:38:29.180" style="s2">shaman and then there was a a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.680" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">conversation and collaboration between</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.180" end="00:38:36.200" style="s2">and among the the distinct populations</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">of in which the shaman are embedded so</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.200" end="00:38:40.700" style="s2">there&#39;s like a a meta religion or a work</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:42.230" style="s2">happening at the meta level and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.700" end="00:38:44.330" style="s2">there&#39;s work happening at the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.230" end="00:38:50.510" style="s2">level right right there&#39;s a network</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.330" end="00:38:57.380" style="s2">topology that actually has the it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.510" end="00:39:01.210" style="s2">a what&#39;s that word called she&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.380" end="00:39:01.210" style="s2">space filling algorithm it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.020" end="00:39:07.490" style="s2">it&#39;s an Optima it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.030" end="00:39:09.230" style="s2">evolutionary optimization function right</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.490" end="00:39:13.010" style="s2">right right right okay for the network</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.230" end="00:39:16.250" style="s2">conforms to the actual optimal flow in</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.010" end="00:39:18.500" style="s2">the reality that defines itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.250" end="00:39:19.580" style="s2">really where the bones the bones with</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.500" end="00:39:21.890" style="s2">the bones of all right they&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.580" end="00:39:24.320" style="s2">evolutionary search algorithm looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.890" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2">for a bunch of different criteria like</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.320" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">right strong and flexible and healable</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.660" end="00:39:31.849" style="s2">you know I&#39;ll just carry erect eristic</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:34.160" style="s2">finds it yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.849" end="00:39:36.320" style="s2">running that yeah it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">because when you said that it triggered</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.320" end="00:39:40.910" style="s2">in me the the or two of the dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">of dialectic because you did you did the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.910" end="00:39:44.630" style="s2">horizontal thing like well the way the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:46.910" style="s2">shamans are embedded and there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.630" end="00:39:48.710" style="s2">horizontal and then you did the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.910" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">they moved to the matter which is again</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.710" end="00:39:52.580" style="s2">at that ontological shifting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:55.960" style="s2">going on in politic so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.580" end="00:39:55.960" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a connection there</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.359" end="00:40:00.589" style="s2">I was just wondering like what would</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.950" end="00:40:03.859" style="s2">have become of us if Socrates in Lao Tzu</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.589" end="00:40:05.210" style="s2">that had been able to hang out yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.859" end="00:40:05.990" style="s2">would have been really cool would have</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.210" end="00:40:07.819" style="s2">been really cool</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.990" end="00:40:09.579" style="s2">it would have been really cool if</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.819" end="00:40:13.519" style="s2">Platonists had made it to India and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.579" end="00:40:15.380" style="s2">studied with what was going on there</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.519" end="00:40:18.980" style="s2">that was his actual intent but of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.380" end="00:40:23.150" style="s2">man the emperor lost in battle and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.980" end="00:40:24.410" style="s2">also led to nothing well now those sorts</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.150" end="00:40:27.079" style="s2">of things can happen with a click of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.410" end="00:40:27.829" style="s2">button yeah which is why again we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.079" end="00:40:30.680" style="s2">a different place</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.829" end="00:40:32.809" style="s2">so dude what you all said was very</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.680" end="00:40:35.450" style="s2">helpful um and like like I said I feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.809" end="00:40:37.039" style="s2">there&#39;s resonance with the dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.450" end="00:40:41.180" style="s2">that I elected which we&#39;ll need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.039" end="00:40:42.470" style="s2">explore I also like it&#39;s like the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.180" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">well I like it but I think there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.470" end="00:40:46.130" style="s2">an appoint separate of my preferences</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:47.720" style="s2">because I think this is another way in</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.130" end="00:40:48.980" style="s2">which the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.720" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">difference from religions because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.980" end="00:40:55.069" style="s2">trying to get out of Iron Age hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:57.170" style="s2">as its fundamental grammar for its</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.069" end="00:40:58.940" style="s2">mythos right so in addition to having to</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.170" end="00:41:00.349" style="s2">break that there&#39;s a deep relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.940" end="00:41:02.989" style="s2">between these two which Jonathan has</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.349" end="00:41:04.940" style="s2">continually argued for the axial age to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.989" end="00:41:07.460" style="s2">world mythology which I argue is</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.940" end="00:41:09.109" style="s2">breaking down and Iron Age bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.460" end="00:41:13.910" style="s2">mutually reinforce each other because</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.109" end="00:41:14.989" style="s2">you the hierarchy right for for dealing</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.910" end="00:41:17.779" style="s2">with the problems we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.989" end="00:41:20.749" style="s2">also seems to be like the ladder that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.779" end="00:41:24.769" style="s2">goes between the two worlds and so they</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.749" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">to this idea of a hierarchy that bridges</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.769" end="00:41:31.190" style="s2">between the worlds is also sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:34.789" style="s2">fundamental thing that is sewn through a</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.789" end="00:41:38.839" style="s2">religions and what&#39;s interesting I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.430" end="00:41:41.450" style="s2">are there&#39;s important exceptions to it</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.839" end="00:41:42.769" style="s2">Taoism tries to subvert the hierarchy in</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.450" end="00:41:46.059" style="s2">some important ways that you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.769" end="00:41:50.299" style="s2">alluded to but nevertheless I think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.059" end="00:41:51.259" style="s2">one of the things I think needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.299" end="00:41:54.609" style="s2">undermined</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.259" end="00:41:57.559" style="s2">is that complicit mutual support between</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.609" end="00:42:00.589" style="s2">hierarchical social organization iron</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.559" end="00:42:02.390" style="s2">age bureaucracies and the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.589" end="00:42:05.539" style="s2">mythology and if what we&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.390" end="00:42:08.390" style="s2">is correct then we have something that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.539" end="00:42:10.279" style="s2">simultaneously takes that to apart</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.390" end="00:42:11.869" style="s2">and then reconfigures something new in</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.279" end="00:42:12.619" style="s2">its place and I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.869" end="00:42:14.599" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.619" end="00:42:18.140" style="s2">yeah so I don&#39;t know try this on see if</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.599" end="00:42:20.299" style="s2">this lands the thing that just popped</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.140" end="00:42:24.200" style="s2">into my head is the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.299" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">a photograph and a hologram hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.200" end="00:42:29.029" style="s2">does that land I think so keep going</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:30.440" style="s2">yeah so other words under the impression</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.029" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">that perhaps at some point this may be</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.440" end="00:42:35.990" style="s2">watched by people other than us</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:38.750" style="s2">distinction that I&#39;m making is in</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.990" end="00:42:42.470" style="s2">principle superficially I may have an</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.750" end="00:42:43.819" style="s2">image of a particular object and I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.470" end="00:42:46.130" style="s2">take a photograph of it I can make a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.819" end="00:42:48.019" style="s2">holograph of it in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.130" end="00:42:50.599" style="s2">photograph what I have the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.019" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">photograph has a characteristic where if</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.599" end="00:42:54.529" style="s2">I cut the photograph in half and I throw</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:57.289" style="s2">away the right half and keep the left</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.529" end="00:43:00.680" style="s2">half then I have 100% of the left half</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.289" end="00:43:03.410" style="s2">and 0% of the right half I&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.680" end="00:43:05.029" style="s2">point second I think yeah I think I know</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.410" end="00:43:07.309" style="s2">where this is going yeah keep going with</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.029" end="00:43:11.240" style="s2">the holograph if I take the whole graph</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.309" end="00:43:13.339" style="s2">and cut it in half I have 100% and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.240" end="00:43:15.950" style="s2">threw the right half in the left half I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.339" end="00:43:19.160" style="s2">have a hundred percent of the whole but</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.950" end="00:43:20.599" style="s2">at lower resolution right okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.160" end="00:43:22.369" style="s2">completely different almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.599" end="00:43:25.509" style="s2">Fourier transform in fact Mia Fourier</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.369" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">transform you can get it approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.509" end="00:43:32.509" style="s2">how your encoding reality now the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:34.250" style="s2">photograph to me topologically feels</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.509" end="00:43:37.539" style="s2">very similar to what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.250" end="00:43:40.490" style="s2">describing and has a certain Iron Age</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.539" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">perspectivism to it yes yes yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.490" end="00:43:48.829" style="s2">a very distinct mapping of location and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:51.500" style="s2">information each picker is a what it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.829" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">yeah yes yes yes where&#39;s the holograph</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.500" end="00:43:55.490" style="s2">has something different so for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.839" end="00:43:57.859" style="s2">let me tell this in the human story i</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.490" end="00:43:59.210" style="s2">mean ii mean see if you can years ago</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.859" end="00:44:01.430" style="s2">know this feels like it&#39;s going in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.210" end="00:44:02.900" style="s2">good direction keep going so in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.430" end="00:44:04.099" style="s2">context of a religion there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.900" end="00:44:07.130" style="s2">religion but it&#39;s held hollow</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.099" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">graphically the opposition would in fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.130" end="00:44:13.690" style="s2">be that every every member every human</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:16.450" style="s2">or every sentient that is a participant</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.690" end="00:44:19.750" style="s2">would be holding the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.450" end="00:44:21.300" style="s2">intrinsically and it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.750" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.300" end="00:44:27.000" style="s2">between and among them that the fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.960" end="00:44:29.610" style="s2">of the story becomes more clear</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.000" end="00:44:33.780" style="s2">that&#39;s excellent this is a very very</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.610" end="00:44:35.880" style="s2">different analogy for meaning than in</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.780" end="00:44:38.580" style="s2">the context where there is for sure a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.880" end="00:44:40.530" style="s2">perfect copy that is somewhere and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.580" end="00:44:45.050" style="s2">question is are you putting it in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.530" end="00:44:49.560" style="s2">right order right right that&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.050" end="00:44:51.750" style="s2">that makes me think of Michael</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.560" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">Anderson&#39;s point about the brain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.750" end="00:44:57.240" style="s2">exaltation right that the brain isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:58.830" style="s2">organized with a stable topography</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.240" end="00:45:02.580" style="s2">hierarchically like we always try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.830" end="00:45:05.880" style="s2">think it was right instead each area</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.580" end="00:45:09.030" style="s2">gets multiplied eggs acted in different</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.880" end="00:45:11.160" style="s2">into different functionalities right you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.030" end="00:45:13.800" style="s2">know the constant circuitry use and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.160" end="00:45:15.720" style="s2">this area if it&#39;s connected with these</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.800" end="00:45:17.250" style="s2">things gives me speech but I&#39;ve expected</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.720" end="00:45:19.260" style="s2">with this thing it controls my right</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.250" end="00:45:22.290" style="s2">hand if it&#39;s connected with in other</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.260" end="00:45:24.840" style="s2">ways it makes possible other new</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.290" end="00:45:26.610" style="s2">emergent functionality and so there</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.840" end="00:45:30.870" style="s2">isn&#39;t a hierarchical organization</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.610" end="00:45:32.820" style="s2">because there like you said a thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.870" end="00:45:34.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have like you said that well you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.820" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">said information is tied to its location</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.770" end="00:45:38.910" style="s2">which is exactly how people still make</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:42.090" style="s2">these friggin pictures of the brain yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.910" end="00:45:43.740" style="s2">and the cartography right the here is</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.090" end="00:45:45.690" style="s2">where this happens here is where this</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.740" end="00:45:47.010" style="s2">happens here is where this happens when</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.690" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">they&#39;re knowing that&#39;s not how the brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.010" end="00:45:50.940" style="s2">works and and the brain is neither</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:53.340" style="s2">completely holistic and neither</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.940" end="00:45:56.790" style="s2">completely localized it&#39;s doing this</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.340" end="00:45:58.650" style="s2">constant you know dynamic a circuitry</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.790" end="00:46:00.150" style="s2">use and react septation of itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.650" end="00:46:03.420" style="s2">continually and when you were just</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.150" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">describing the holding the the story</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.420" end="00:46:06.870" style="s2">holographically that was saying well</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:09.140" style="s2">that seems to comport really well with</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.870" end="00:46:12.600" style="s2">how the brain wants to actually function</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.140" end="00:46:16.830" style="s2">yeah yeah so and so we can we can make a</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.600" end="00:46:20.160" style="s2">small like a very small concrete scaling</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.830" end="00:46:21.990" style="s2">move okay we give it we have good reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.160" end="00:46:25.170" style="s2">to believe this is out the brain inside</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.990" end="00:46:27.330" style="s2">this body engine so if we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.170" end="00:46:29.790" style="s2">doing distributed cognition we should do</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.330" end="00:46:31.800" style="s2">that that way as well yes exactly exact</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.790" end="00:46:34.170" style="s2">on tenuity up and down levels of scale</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.800" end="00:46:34.830" style="s2">exactly exactly that&#39;s exactly whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.170" end="00:46:36.540" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.830" end="00:46:39.270" style="s2">exactly I will propose it given what you</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.540" end="00:46:40.980" style="s2">just said a few minutes ago exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.270" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">the implications are actually really</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.980" end="00:46:45.120" style="s2">powerful in terms of the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:51.030" style="s2">we may like to see in terms of what Paul</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.120" end="00:46:54.300" style="s2">was saying it scalability yes because so</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.030" end="00:46:55.740" style="s2">I&#39;m doing something with brain and when</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.300" end="00:46:58.530" style="s2">I&#39;m doing something to brains I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.740" end="00:47:01.290" style="s2">to move from speaking to say having my</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.530" end="00:47:04.410" style="s2">hand move there&#39;s something like the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.290" end="00:47:06.300" style="s2">the constellation or the configuration</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.410" end="00:47:07.800" style="s2">of the subcomponents and their relation</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.300" end="00:47:10.080" style="s2">ality that gives rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.800" end="00:47:12.200" style="s2">transformation of capacity yes very much</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.080" end="00:47:16.080" style="s2">very much this just happen in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.200" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">Methos space I&#39;m sitting there trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.080" end="00:47:20.850" style="s2">get a handle on a particular inquiry in</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:21.600" style="s2">Methos space and the answer is well I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.850" end="00:47:23.850" style="s2">actually have to get the right</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.600" end="00:47:25.560" style="s2">constellation and it may see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.850" end="00:47:30.030" style="s2">actually a seven-year-old kid in Bangkok</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.560" end="00:47:31.500" style="s2">right now she&#39;s the one who&#39;s resonant</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.030" end="00:47:32.670" style="s2">frequency and the overall hologram is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.500" end="00:47:34.490" style="s2">actually enables the spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.670" end="00:47:37.500" style="s2">transformation of this particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.490" end="00:47:39.210" style="s2">and clarity in the location in mythos if</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.500" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">there were an inquiry that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.210" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">wonderful that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:44.670" style="s2">I like that perfect symmetry across all</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:48.210" style="s2">possible participants in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.670" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">conversation instead of instead of doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.210" end="00:47:52.760" style="s2">the scale in terms of power you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:55.230" style="s2">it in terms of capacity to participate</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.760" end="00:47:57.780" style="s2">which i think is a which is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.230" end="00:47:59.100" style="s2">fundamental difference and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.780" end="00:48:02.010" style="s2">if there&#39;s actually as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.100" end="00:48:05.100" style="s2">that oh yeah I almost felt like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.010" end="00:48:06.420" style="s2">a key constantly moving back to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.100" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">notion of scalability in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.420" end="00:48:10.440" style="s2">technological sense which you said the</p>
