<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">the western tradition the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">hypatia we&#39;re basically in the high</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">school and we&#39;re talking about stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">i hope you&#39;re also seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">retrospectively the continuities</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">with epicureanism so we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">about some basic principles</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">one of the first principles is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">internalization of socrates or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">internalization of the sage</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.440" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">for stoicism it&#39;s socrates socrates</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">plays to the western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">what the figure like the buddha or lao</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">say play within the eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">we&#39;re internalizing the sage in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">transform our inner dialogue remember</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:47.919" style="s2">anticipates i&#39;ve learned to converse</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">with myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.919" end="00:18:51.679" style="s2">i learned via logos i replace inner</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">babble</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.679" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">in a monkey mind with inner socratic</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">imagine what that would be like if that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">became our normal way of being</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.559" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">and then that&#39;s a and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">the process of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">internalization as a perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">we talked about pygotsky and we did</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">last time the view from above as a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">enact that third-person sage-like</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">and then practice internalizing it into</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">our own perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:25.799" style="s2">to give us the higher highest order</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.799" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">meta-perspectival ability to reconfigure</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">what we find salient and relevant in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">way so that we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">constantly tempted by our salience</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:39.679" style="s2">landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">to what is good what is the good life</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.679" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">and that leads us of course to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:47.679" style="s2">of aspiration that we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">aspiring uh to become wise</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.679" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">and this is a participatory knowing this</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:54.240" style="s2">is where we&#39;re actually knowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">by living it by loving it by uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.240" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">by being bound to it coupled to it so</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">our identity is being transformed as our</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">of knowing it this of course is the only</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">way you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">virtue you only know honesty by becoming</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">more and more honest</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">and you can only know honesty if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">already have some honesty to degree</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">to some degree and so the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:19.919" style="s2">uh what we&#39;re trying to do and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">wise is we&#39;re trying to seek we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.919" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">aspiring to that which is always good</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:25.679" style="s2">because the stoics ask the question what</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">is always good</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.679" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">and what is always good is wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">he&#39;s talked about an idea of wisdom as</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">deeply connected to the virtue uh virtue</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">is basically the beauty of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">virtue is how you appropriately discern</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">what is most relevant and important in</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">this situation in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">most reliably affords you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">moving towards the good life</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">and so uh there&#39;s deep connections and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:02.159" style="s2">very intrinsic to stoicism between</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">wisdom and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">where rationality doesn&#39;t just mean what</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">we now think of it as sort of formal</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">logic being more logical avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">inconsistency</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">uh logic that&#39;s why i often use the term</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.679" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">for this the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">psychologic it has much more to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">comprehensively overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">um self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">so what we&#39;re actually after is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">of self-transcending rationality a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">rationality that affords us to become</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">more rational</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">that affords us to become more rational</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">because and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">of course you&#39;ll see where this will end</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">up this will end up in the platonic</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">um ascent out of the cave uh the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">that as i become less self-deceived i</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">come to realize the real patterns that</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about now that we get</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:57.520" style="s2">better at judging what is real</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what for the for the stoics the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.520" end="00:22:03.520" style="s2">core of rationality is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">argumentation um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.520" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">judgment it has to do with our ability</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">to judge what is real</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">our ability to desire what is good</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">and our ability to move to more of an</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">to orient to identify with that which is</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">in our control and what&#39;s most in our</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">control of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">is the capacity uh by which we make</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">meaning so the training of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">so before i get into this and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">we&#39;re going to learn for today the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">dharma</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:41.919" style="s2">i want to address the question some a</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">series of questions that came up</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.919" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">uh last time in connection with the term</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">i used i made a distinction it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">distinction that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">stoics make between emotion</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">which is to be in motion by the way to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">move out</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">emote right um and passion</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">and they compare this to walking down a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">hill and this is running down here while</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">you lose control and then some of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">uh for example i think mark made a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">very well written comment about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:13.919" style="s2">exists because it&#39;s but aren&#39;t most</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">things you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.919" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">done with passion that can things people</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:19.039" style="s2">don&#39;t acquire</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">like don&#39;t achieve great things they</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.039" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t meant to require achieve great</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">uh unless there&#39;s passion</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">uh so what we&#39;re what the problem we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.480" style="s2">facing with that is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">we&#39;re facing anachronistic equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.480" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">where equivocation is two different</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">meanings of the same term</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">and anachronism is to not pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">to historical context</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">so let&#39;s pay attention to the let&#39;s pay</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">attention first of all to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">go back in the history of this word and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">it&#39;s deeply related to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">this word passive passion is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.840" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">opposite of action</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">when you&#39;re passive you&#39;re not engaging</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">you&#39;re not acting</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">um the the stoic term that&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">is um is pathe</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">it&#39;s where we get our term pathetic from</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">so what the stoics mean by passion</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.799" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">is when we become pathetic because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">are completely passive</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">in the face of our arousal and our</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">effective state</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">it has run away with us and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">metaphor of running down</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">uh the hill now what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:30.480" style="s2">interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">we have taken this term and we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.480" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">uh to be strongly motivated</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">and and in terms of strongly committed</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">motivated not just i have the impulse</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">but i&#39;m actually committing myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">which of course is the opposite of being</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">past passive</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">uh strongly committed</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the opposite of being passive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">the opposite of being pathetic</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">we hear this term and we hear it as sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">of uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">heroism heroism um</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">now what the stoics would say to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">idea of how that term has gotten so far</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">away from</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">its original meaning like the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">the word stoic</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">like the meaning of the word cynic um is</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">that it reflects uh a kind of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">that and this is what modern stoics say</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">that&#39;s prevalent in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">where we tend to confuse we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">about this before we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">epicureans we tend to infuse we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">confuse intensity</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">uh with commitment that the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">that makes us committed to things</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">is the experience of intense feeling um</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">and what the stoics would say to that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">now what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">actually what you actually need for</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">commitment</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">is because feelings are actually not</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">and feelings vacillate um and feelings</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">contradict themselves one moment you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">feeling uh then the next one you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">feeling this and affiliates don&#39;t lie</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">what they say is what they would ask you</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">what actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">what actually keeps people in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">long-term commitment it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">i mean this is a question so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">compare let&#39;s compare the intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">infatuation</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">with the commitment of love if you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">to try</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">and keep committed to your</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">partner through always you know trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">to rely</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:31.600" style="s2">on that in the intensity of infatuation</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">and of course people do this</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">uh we call them infatuation junkies and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">that picks up on something that mark was</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">saying he was he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">trying to think about with this more in</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">terms of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:43.200" style="s2">but you know if the infatuation junkie</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">is somebody</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.200" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">who once the infatuation fades as it</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">inevitably does</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">because that is the nature of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">the relationship ends</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">what actually keeps</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">the relationship going a relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">love well it&#39;s it&#39;s commitment</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;s commitment and what is it in a</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">what what&#39;s the original meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:52.080" style="s2">virtue well think about virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">shaping of possibility virtue actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.080" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">means power</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">that&#39;s why we have phrases like in</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">virtue of right so</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">virtue actually means a power it means a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">power to commit reliably</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">to what is good a power</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">to commit reliably to what is good</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">and so for aristotle what you do is you</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">that give that empower us at long</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">term habits and skills and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">you you have them directed towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">what is considered by you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">in your most rational states the good</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">the true the good and the beautiful so</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">perhaps a better way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">it is right</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">is to say the stoics are</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2">engaged in the psychology of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">examine</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">what actually keeps us committed</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">long term to the good and that is not</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">typically feeling that is typically</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">so hence wisdom because virtue</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">is just the way in which we are wise in</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">a particular situation</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">we bring sophia principle to bear</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">talked about this cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">of rationality in terms of the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">logic and this is me trying to remind</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">you that i&#39;m not using logic</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">just in the modern sense this has to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">as i said not so much with argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">but much more with judgment and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">judgment has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">this stoic practice pro soch</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">and prososh the best translation of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">proshots is mindfulness so all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">training we did plugs in right here</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">right here</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t typically think of</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">mindfulness as a logical</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">act but in terms of the logic of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">stoics mindfulness is a deeply logical</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">thing to do but a better way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:08.799" style="s2">is that mindfulness is a deeply rational</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:13.799" style="s2">thing to do think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.799" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">ra ra ratio and rationing</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.799" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">appropriately apportioning</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">and in proper proportion look at listen</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">how these words all sing together</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">appropriate you know proportioning and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">proper</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.559" style="s2">proportioning of your what you have your</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.559" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">and what how you find things salient and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">relevant that&#39;s the core</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the core the core of this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">paying attention so your salience</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.840" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">shapes you towards</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">so there&#39;s a triangle here and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">is ethics which doesn&#39;t mean what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">reduced it to which is a very following</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">content very legal notion</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">of you know what&#39;s what&#39;s our duties and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">what are the rules that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">have a duty towards for that for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">stoics this is again much more</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">psychological it&#39;s about how we deal</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">with impulse</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about that today and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">over here</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">we have physics and physics isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:22.880" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s not the same as modern</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.600" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.880" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">what what we&#39;re doing here is learning</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">to discipline</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">desire so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">is learning to see things as they are</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.799" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">independent from the projections of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">now of course modern physics tries to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">that too it tries to get us to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">objectively see them see see the thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">just the properties that are belong to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">the object</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">not things that we project on it in</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">terms of our values or our desires our</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">hopes</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the connection here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">trying to see things independent</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">of our projections we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">withdraw our projections</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">here we&#39;re trying to do with that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">trying to deal with that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">ourself</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">that is not in our control the impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">aspect</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">so this is all falls under the so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.080" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">two big things i said one was prososh</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">the other is prochyron</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">so prochyron is to practice so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:39.679" style="s2">things become ready to hand</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:40.159" style="s2">right so like so again the training of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.679" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">habit</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">and skill and attention so things are</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">ready to hand</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">they come naturally to mind in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">in which they are needed we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">trying to train how do we bring</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:57.120" style="s2">into process how do we make a process to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">be governed by principle</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.120" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got we have to prac the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">that link that here</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">okay principle</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">process and right what links them</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">practice again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:17.519" style="s2">again and again we oh we can all we love</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.519" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">talking about our principles we also</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">like a pro oh just do what</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">feel go with your gut feel it just go</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">what you actually have to do according</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">to stoics is now you have to practice a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">getting clear about the principles and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">bringing them into process</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">you have to practice to seeing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">actually going on in the process</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">and putting it under the regulation of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">the relevant</p>

<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">and then you can go and look at similar</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">ones and you&#39;ll find the same practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.079" style="s2">the same principles are being repeated</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">again and again and again</p>

<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">something in the world and then we get</p>

<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re just right this is what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.800" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">most directly by your judgment so</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">you get your initial impression and then</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:31.720" style="s2">get and there&#39;s various ways of talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">about this you get you do</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">or you do categorization</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.599" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">you do conceptualization these are all</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.800" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">they&#39;re slightly different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">saying the same thing slightly different</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">ization you actually create</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">propositional content sometimes this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">also called</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">in your senses and then you represent it</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">to your mind think about the word</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">representation means</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">so what this means is so you go from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">impressions to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:20.880" style="s2">let&#39;s try and do it slowly so here&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">and then i start seeing it as a marker</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">and i categorize it as a marker that i</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">can use and knows how now i&#39;m going in</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">it&#39;s an it and i&#39;m going into the having</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">mode right away</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">and now i start to conceptualize it</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">things i can do with markers</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">and then i make some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">assertion about it uh this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">marker</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">or this marker is not so good because</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">it&#39;s running out of it i start to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">um a judgment about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">now like i said when all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.319" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">happening unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:41:00.640" style="s2">automatically and reactively mindlessly</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">then of course we are fettered to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">by all of this confusion</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">so what the stoics want us to do is they</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">want us to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">introduce judgment here and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">use the greek word for judgment</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">crisis that&#39;s the greek word for</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.839" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">you go crisis crisis is a bad thing well</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">think about what we mean by a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">we mean things are being caught</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">everything that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:33.200" style="s2">we thought was stable and secure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:36.400" style="s2">just the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.200" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">is actually being called into question</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.400" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">things are unraveling the structures are</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:47.680" style="s2">apart they&#39;re unraveling</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s an opportunity for real</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.680" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a critical moment crisis</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">critical cutting cross cutting across</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">these are all related ideas what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">doing is trying to afford</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:04.319" style="s2">the unraveling the coming apart the</p>

<p begin="00:42:04.319" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">question of this structure this fusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.319" style="s2">so that we afford the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:13.680" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.319" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">things differently we afford the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.680" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">possibility of real</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">insight where we shift the aspect</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">we come to a new category we see new</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">for how we can talk about it think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">reflect on it so this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">ultimately about trying to generate</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:39.760" style="s2">cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">now that this whole so</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">the they if you&#39;ll um this whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">sequence here</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:54.119" style="s2">all of these things um epictetus calls</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:57.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.119" end="00:42:58.800" style="s2">epilegene which this is from logos where</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.599" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">we get logic from</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.800" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">this we if this is related to our word</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">epilogue so the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.319" style="s2">this is all kind of inner speaking this</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">is speaking</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.319" end="00:43:10.160" style="s2">after the impression the epilogue and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">what we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">is we want to replace this automatic</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">epilogue</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">with critical dialogue we want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">replace the automatic</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:22.319" style="s2">epilogue with critical dialogue we want</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">keep we want to pull it apart we want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">defuse it</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">so one way you can think about this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:35.760" style="s2">ellen langer in his work</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">sorry in her work on mindfulness talks</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.760" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">about replacing</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">absolute learning with conditional and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">she has</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">she has experimental evidence that this</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">really imperial improves people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">problem-solving ability</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">so if i were to teach you something</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">absolutely it would be this is what it</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:54.400" style="s2">this is x when i teach it conditionally</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">i teach it to you</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.400" end="00:44:01.280" style="s2">one way of thinking about this as as x</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">so i keep separate in how i&#39;m teaching</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.280" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">it to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">all of this from the thing i don&#39;t fuse</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">them together and say</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">this is x what i do is say</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">one way of thinking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">x i replace epilogic</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">confusion and monologic reaction with</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">dial with critical dialogical</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">so i&#39;m getting close to how</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">do you do this what&#39;s a way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">and so all three authors uh talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.160" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">this pierre hadeau</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.839" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">and and uh you know a practice called</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:45.599" style="s2">objective seeing</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">uh mcclellan in uh the wisdom of hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.599" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">calls it</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">neutral description uh bosari calls it</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">uh physical definition you can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">they&#39;re all trying to zero in</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">on something</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">and this has to go back to this notion</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">of ipake</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">which is suspending judgment by the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:08.720" style="s2">this is a valuable and hopefully useful</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:12.160" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.720" end="00:45:15.760" style="s2">this is a central practice within</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.160" end="00:45:15.760" style="s2">the philosophical tradition known as</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.839" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">you try to right phenomena how things</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:25.200" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">shining how they&#39;re appearing to us and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.200" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">you try</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">to get a very rigorous awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.359" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">how things are appearing to you and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">and and husserl who invented it</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">actually invented this process called</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">ipake</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">and if you want to get good at that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">there&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">really highly recommended book uh called</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">experimental phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">by diane ivy where he takes you through</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:50.079" style="s2">a whole bunch of exercises</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">what&#39;s valuable about this is it first</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.079" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">of all teaches you uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">how to do this kind of seeing or</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">description that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">it&#39;s actually how to do it right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">what&#39;s also valuable is that allows you</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">to make links</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">uh potentially between stoic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">and continental philosophy people</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">talking about the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">uh people like cultural and heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">etc so highly recommended</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">so what do we do with physical</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">or i like to call it objective seeing</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">uh because i want to emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">perceptual attentional aspect</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">buzzaro uh like i said uh bizarro</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">pizzari</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">calls it um physical description and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">um the column calls it neutral</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">description so</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">how does it work well it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">interesting because it actually plugs</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:46.560" style="s2">a lot of the research on how you get</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">children to delay gratification</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.560" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">to and so uh and this is the famous</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">marshmallow test there&#39;s a confound in</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">the marshmallow test</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">with socioeconomic status having to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">long-term prediction</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">but you can put that aside you can look</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">at some of the mechanisms however</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">that do help people delay gratification</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">and one of them is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">redescription</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">um there was a little girl so you put</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">you know the famous marshmallow you put</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:09.520" style="s2">the marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">in front and how long can they delay and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.520" end="00:47:13.119" style="s2">you say to them you you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:15.119" style="s2">um you can eat the marshmallow whenever</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.119" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">you want the longer you wait though the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">greater the chance will give you a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">second marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">and you measure how long they can delay</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">right until lane gratification is</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">important and what you</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">do it what one like what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">get people to reframe it</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">uh one four-year-old did</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">she literally put a mental frame around</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:41.599" style="s2">it and she treated it like a picture</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">of a marshmallow a representation</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.599" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">rather than the marshmallow itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:49.119" style="s2">and she famously said well the way i</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">because you can&#39;t eat a picture</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.119" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t eat a picture she pulled apart</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">and the representation for her from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">thing itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">the marshmallow they also taught the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">kids to zero in and redescribe</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">marshmallows as you know they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">fluffy white clouds</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">so you you get a strategy of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">redescribe things re-ass spectralize</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">them re-categorize them</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">so that the the way they initially</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">present themselves to you falls into</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">in the sense of all of those things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">are fused together get pulled apart</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">and when you pull them apart that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">space of your freedom</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:29.119" style="s2">that&#39;s how you can see through those</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">cracks that you open up</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.119" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">that&#39;s that is the vehicle of insight</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">so what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">what do we do so let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">example from marcus rillis and i chose</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">one that&#39;s a little off-putting</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">you go ich and that&#39;s and i chose it</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">deliberately for that reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">here&#39;s a quote from marcus aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">sex as the friction of two pieces of</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">and the ejaculation of a sticky fluid</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">and you go ew there what&#39;s wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:07.920" style="s2">well what&#39;s he trying to do well</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:09.760" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to describe it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.920" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">why uh bazaar calls it a physical</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.760" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">description</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">and the clone calls it a neutral</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">description he&#39;s trying to describe</p>

<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">remember the research showing that if</p>

<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:29.280" style="s2">to a third person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">you will also often get tremendous</p>

<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">this is called the construal level</p>

<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">uh there you try to take a non-human</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">perspective on it</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:11.839" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to look at the whole to</p>

<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">are the substances and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">and the forces at work within it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:24.079" style="s2">trying to give it its most</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">proper name the name that would be true</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.079" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">in the greatest number of contexts that</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">description that marcus aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">made will be the case no matter what</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">from the most horrible to the most</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">and you go okay i get it why am i doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:46.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">because that is the practice by with</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.640" end="00:50:51.599" style="s2">which you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">train judgment by which you withdraw</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">because when you do that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">doing the uk</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re realizing</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">has to do with what you&#39;re projecting</p>

<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">and what that tells you is that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not the sex</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:16.000" style="s2">that is so valuable the sex per se</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">but all of that machinery uh by which</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.000" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">meaning is being made but maybe that in</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:21.280" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">maybe that machinery could happen more</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">and this of course is central to the</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">in which you realize wait what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">that are actually you&#39;re almost neutral</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.920" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">towards because it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:54.559" style="s2">to give a neutral description of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:56.680" style="s2">and then go</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.559" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">by degrees like progressive</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.680" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">desensitization</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">to redescribing things that are less</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">neutral to you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:05.680" style="s2">but in an increasingly like you&#39;ll sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:08.640" style="s2">it as an increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:09.920" style="s2">more neutral fashion and by that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.640" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">progressive</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.920" end="00:53:17.359" style="s2">movement you will learn to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">be happy more critical in your judgment</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.359" end="00:53:19.680" style="s2">and you&#39;ll be there by training your</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:20.960" style="s2">psychologic</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.680" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">so what we&#39;re going to continue to do is</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.960" end="00:53:23.200" style="s2">we&#39;re going to take a look at each one</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.200" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">right the logic the physics and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">ethics and look about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">the particular spiritual exercises you</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">can do for each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:34.800" style="s2">as a way of training irrationality</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.800" end="00:53:39.280" style="s2">uh virtue and aspiring to wisdom okay so</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:41.680" style="s2">i&#39;m going to go back</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.280" end="00:53:42.640" style="s2">on to the cushion nose so i can see the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">and uh take any questions that people uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">might have</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">about today&#39;s dharma or about last time</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">with the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:54.400" style="s2">or anything from the wisdom of hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">or in fact anything from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.400" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">entire meditation and cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.839" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">wisdom series</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">so the first question is from pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">of doubt or brett</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:23.280" style="s2">uh brad i haven&#39;t talked to you in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">i miss talking to you again i will see</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.280" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">you monday night though because</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">i&#39;ll be on the discord server for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">monthly q a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:31.920" style="s2">uh x the the question brad asks is i</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">think is like a crucial question here</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.920" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">does internalizing socrates require</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">having deeply studied properties</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">to it to a significant degree yes so</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">um it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:46.559" style="s2">people of course we had a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.559" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">in which people always had at least one</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">sage that they had internalized</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">for many people for example it might be</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">jesus or</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">moses or or muhammad</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">right um but we&#39;ve we&#39;ve lost that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">uh we all walk around</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">that&#39;s too strong i&#39;m sorry many of us</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:10.319" style="s2">walk around with a hole in our heart</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even realize that we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:16.319" style="s2">but that is ready for the reception of</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">the internalized sage</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.319" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">i actually think given the situation we</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">in that we should have a community of</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">sages that we&#39;ve internalized</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">so i try to internalize uh socrates um</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">platinus uh spinoza siddhartha</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">and jesus of nazareth</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:40.240" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s important to uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">learn about socrates and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.240" end="00:55:43.440" style="s2">great gifts given to us and we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">about this when we move into</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.440" end="00:55:47.680" style="s2">uh the third degree of wisdom is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">platonic dialogues they&#39;re not always</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.680" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">and i recommend starting with the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">popular ones like the symposium</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">or the republic or listening to them on</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.680" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">audiobook which is very helpful for many</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">because they&#39;re actually dialogues and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">the point of a dialogue is not just what</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">people say</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">the point is also because that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">propositional the point is the drama</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:09.119" style="s2">the perspectival right the perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:10.960" style="s2">that are there</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.119" end="00:56:12.720" style="s2">and the participatory knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.960" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">character that are there</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.720" end="00:56:19.119" style="s2">and so reading and learning more of just</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">familiarizing yourself with socrates in</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.119" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">the situation of socratic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">definitely helps there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">excellent books and if people want i</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">could recommend some books to read</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">to get a sense of it there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">videos on this</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:32.960" style="s2">um there i think it&#39;s the fourth episode</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:35.119" style="s2">of my video series</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis helps</p>

<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:48.240" style="s2">philosophical scholastic historically</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">accurate thing</p>

<p begin="00:57:21.440" end="00:57:27.599" style="s2">because of funding circumstances and</p>

<p begin="00:57:44.799" end="00:57:48.559" style="s2">uh deborah wagstaff so children learn to</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">pay attention to how they pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.559" end="00:57:51.599" style="s2">by imitating the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">adults around them doing the same that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.599" end="00:57:55.440" style="s2">exactly right</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.799" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">you can say the most beautiful things</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually what you do</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:25.839" style="s2">that really matters that&#39;s why we even</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">have this phrase it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.839" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">phrase</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">in deed think about what the word means</p>

<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">i reached out to touch saturn as i</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:48.880" style="s2">passed suddenly realizing i was massive</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">expanded to hold saturn if i wished</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.880" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">focusing on maintaining expansion and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">filling my body so i i believe that</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:58:56.480" style="s2">deborah was talking about last week</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">and she was talking about the view from</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.480" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">above and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:02.720" style="s2">your your sense of self and your</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:05.520" style="s2">identity will become</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">like wisdom-filled water or even</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:08.400" style="s2">wondered phil</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:10.000" style="s2">wonderful wonder filled i was going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.400" end="00:59:11.839" style="s2">say wonderful but this is better</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.000" end="00:59:13.760" style="s2">wonder filled water you&#39;ll feel your</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:15.040" style="s2">identity moving around in</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.760" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">the state of wonder because wonder is</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.040" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2">exactly the state in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:21.119" style="s2">calling ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">and how we see things into question and</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.119" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">so you get that wondered filled</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:26.640" style="s2">watery sense of self it flows it expands</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">it shifts</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.640" end="00:59:32.799" style="s2">it moves and what that does is challenge</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:33.760" style="s2">again the automaticity by which we</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.799" end="00:59:36.160" style="s2">assume</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.760" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">and assign identities so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.160" end="00:59:40.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:41.680" style="s2">manual post great to see you emanuel</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.240" end="00:59:43.119" style="s2">uh the lesson is focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.680" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">depersonalization of things i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.119" end="00:59:48.319" style="s2">wondering if there&#39;s a set of practices</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:51.359" style="s2">that does the opposite um so</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.319" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not so much it&#39;s depersonalizing um</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.359" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">not for its own sake uh it&#39;s crisis</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">your your so the point is to</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:03.119" style="s2">introduce enough depersonalization so</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:04.480" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have absolute learning</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:06.240" style="s2">you still have conditional learning</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.480" end="01:00:07.119" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to stop seeing persons</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.240" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">as persons</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.119" end="01:00:13.119" style="s2">because in fact that&#39;s a proper name for</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">this particular kind of individual</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.119" end="01:00:16.599" style="s2">so what you might be saying is well i</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:17.920" style="s2">will see things a lot less</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.599" end="01:00:20.799" style="s2">anthropomorphically</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:21.520" style="s2">um and so within sourcism manual you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.799" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">not going to see</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.520" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">something that counterbalances that but</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">within neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll see you&#39;ll see something that</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">counterbalances that which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">after people have gone through rigorous</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:33.920" style="s2">rational training</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:35.119" style="s2">so they&#39;re not doing anthropomorphic</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.920" end="01:00:38.720" style="s2">projection</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.119" end="01:00:41.839" style="s2">then you can bring back a symbolic way</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.720" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">of seeing things as a way of cultivating</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.839" end="01:00:46.480" style="s2">wisdom but the point</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:47.280" style="s2">of the neoplatonus is if people do the</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.480" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:52.720" style="s2">without having deeply done the first the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">chance that they are going to fall into</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.720" end="01:00:57.040" style="s2">unrecognized projection</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">and thereby significant self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.040" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">is very very high</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s why it&#39;s a a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">these wisdom traditions converge</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">and even in the buddhism remember the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:08.000" style="s2">famous quote from the buddha this is how</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">you&#39;ll know</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.000" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">somebody is not my disciple if they</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">offer to perform a miracle</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">right so the the uh the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">you know magical projection is is</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.400" end="01:01:21.839" style="s2">always called very deeply into question</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">by all these traditions</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.839" end="01:01:27.280" style="s2">uh because of the proclivity uh for</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">uh self-deceptive projection within it</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.280" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">so in answer to your question</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">not so much within stoicism not so much</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:34.160" style="s2">within high school but once you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">the high school</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:38.559" style="s2">you move into university neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:41.440" style="s2">and neoplatonism has</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.559" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">theorgic practices that do exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.440" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">you&#39;re asking me about</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:46.720" style="s2">but they do it on the understanding that</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.040" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">you have passed through</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.720" end="01:01:51.119" style="s2">uh elementary and uh elementary school</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">in high school so i hope that answers</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.119" end="01:01:54.559" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">uh robert gray follow up to brett&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.559" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">question does internalizing someone</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">alive differ widely from someone you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.000" end="01:02:00.000" style="s2">only read about or heard about second</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:02.319" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.000" end="01:02:03.440" style="s2">the christ or buddha like a mentor</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.319" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">parent friend</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.440" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">um so i think i&#39;ve met people who</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.839" style="s2">whose sage is someone living and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">internalized</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.839" end="01:02:20.640" style="s2">um the difficulty there</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:21.839" style="s2">the difficulty there is um when we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:24.400" style="s2">a personal relation</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.839" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">well think about how elevated the buddha</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.400" end="01:02:28.319" style="s2">and christ are</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:29.520" style="s2">for many people and if you push if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.319" end="01:02:32.559" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.520" end="01:02:35.200" style="s2">that elevated status onto a human being</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.559" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">the buddha and christ have passed into</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.200" end="01:02:38.079" style="s2">mythos</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:39.599" style="s2">and i don&#39;t mean that in a pejorative</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.079" end="01:02:41.440" style="s2">sense and that again</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.599" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">alludes to what manual was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.440" end="01:02:46.079" style="s2">they&#39;ve passed into mythos</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:46.640" style="s2">and so it is not unbearable for them to</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.640" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">that kind of elevated status but</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:53.760" style="s2">treating a living human being</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">with that elevated expectation can be</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.760" end="01:02:58.240" style="s2">very crushing and demanding on them</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:03:00.160" style="s2">and it can and they can they they can</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.240" end="01:03:03.760" style="s2">suffer the fate of icarus</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.160" end="01:03:05.280" style="s2">um under our hands um and you know that</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:07.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a famous song by ziggy</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.280" end="01:03:09.119" style="s2">by david bowie stardust about how the</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.200" end="01:03:11.119" style="s2">fans actually destroyed ziggy</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.119" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">because they elevated him into a leper</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.119" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">messiah</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">um and so yes you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:18.920" style="s2">but you have to remember to</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">counterbalance that with not</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.920" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">dehumanizing the person we forget that</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:24.400" style="s2">there are two ways of dehumanizing</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.440" end="01:03:25.920" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.400" end="01:03:27.440" style="s2">and this was something that conrad&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.920" end="01:03:29.280" style="s2">literature is so good on we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.440" end="01:03:32.400" style="s2">dehumanize people</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.280" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">by right treating them</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.400" end="01:03:36.559" style="s2">by demonizing them right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">something we&#39;re very concerned with</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.559" end="01:03:39.760" style="s2">rightly so by the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:41.680" style="s2">in our culture right now but what we</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.760" end="01:03:44.480" style="s2">don&#39;t pay enough attention critical</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.680" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">critical crisis attention to is how you</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.480" end="01:03:48.319" style="s2">can de-personalize somebody by deifying</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.960" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.319" end="01:03:52.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s just as disastrous that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:56.240" style="s2">problem of colonel kurtz</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.000" end="01:03:59.520" style="s2">right in the heart of darkness so</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.240" end="01:04:02.640" style="s2">if you can have a stereoscopic vision of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.520" end="01:04:03.520" style="s2">the living person if you can through one</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.640" end="01:04:06.960" style="s2">eye</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.520" end="01:04:09.680" style="s2">see them mythologically as the sage</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.960" end="01:04:10.400" style="s2">but through the other eye see them in a</p>

<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:18.079" style="s2">that is the golden mean between</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.760" end="01:04:21.359" style="s2">demonizing them and deifying them</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.079" end="01:04:24.559" style="s2">then a living person can be internalized</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.359" end="01:04:25.839" style="s2">as a sage griswold grim</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.559" end="01:04:28.240" style="s2">how much difference between an</p>

<p begin="01:04:28.240" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">daemon so that&#39;s a really good question</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.280" end="01:04:36.559" style="s2">and the stoics talk about that inner</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">part of themselves as the ruling faculty</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.559" end="01:04:40.400" style="s2">they sometimes talked about it as the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.559" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">internal sage they often</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.400" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">often call that their daemon uh and what</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.960" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">uh what</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.920" end="01:04:47.280" style="s2">griswold is referring to is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.319" end="01:04:48.880" style="s2">socrates had</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.280" end="01:04:50.480" style="s2">daemon isn&#39;t the same thing as demon</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">demon is another thing in which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:53.760" style="s2">degraded a term</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">to give it exactly the opposite meaning</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.760" end="01:04:58.240" style="s2">damon was the voice from a higher order</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:05:00.720" style="s2">perspective than your own</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.240" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">ego perspective identity when you get</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.720" end="01:05:04.240" style="s2">like for</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:04.799" style="s2">the equivalent in the in the um eastern</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.240" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.799" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">is the buddha within the buddha within</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">that&#39;s your damon</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">peter lindberg talks about uh how his</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:14.160" style="s2">damon leads us</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s your sacred second self</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.160" end="01:05:17.359" style="s2">your divine double</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:20.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the voice of the third person</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.359" end="01:05:22.480" style="s2">perspective that is calling you vocation</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.480" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">calling you to the good calling you to</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.480" end="01:05:27.200" style="s2">wisdom um and socrates had such a voice</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">it would it would when he when he was</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.200" end="01:05:30.960" style="s2">about to do something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:32.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just conscience that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.960" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">trivialized when he was about to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.640" end="01:05:36.480" style="s2">something wrong it would impact on him</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.559" end="01:05:38.880" style="s2">and his whole he would be turned</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.480" end="01:05:43.599" style="s2">metanoia away from</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.880" end="01:05:45.280" style="s2">uh on that and so i think for the stoics</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.599" end="01:05:48.160" style="s2">and especially for modern stoics like</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.280" end="01:05:50.480" style="s2">peter lindberg internalizing socrates</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.160" end="01:05:51.280" style="s2">and cultivating a socratic daemon</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.480" end="01:05:54.480" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.280" end="01:05:56.400" style="s2">uh um emulates and imitates socrates</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.480" end="01:05:58.160" style="s2">damon they&#39;re one in the same process</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.400" end="01:06:00.160" style="s2">they&#39;re two different ways of talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.160" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">about the same thing and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:04.720" style="s2">powerful so of course people</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:06.240" style="s2">um uh often also uh christians</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.720" end="01:06:08.480" style="s2">experience the voice of christ</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.240" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">the voice of jesus or or the moving of</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.480" end="01:06:12.559" style="s2">the holy spirit</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.839" end="01:06:14.079" style="s2">um and of course the buddha the</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.559" end="01:06:16.559" style="s2">buddhists have the buddha nature</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.079" end="01:06:18.079" style="s2">um interestingly in taoism it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.559" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">more impersonal but you you</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.079" end="01:06:21.280" style="s2">you feel the dao and you feel that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:24.319" style="s2">often is</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.280" end="01:06:25.039" style="s2">key or chi um redirecting what you find</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.319" end="01:06:27.440" style="s2">salient</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.039" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">and the identities you&#39;re assuming and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.440" end="01:06:31.119" style="s2">assigning</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.319" end="01:06:31.520" style="s2">thinking of chia&#39;s secret magical energy</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.119" end="01:06:34.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.520" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">such a profound and almost</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.960" end="01:06:42.319" style="s2">racist misreading of that concept</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:45.200" style="s2">it&#39;s such a bad misappropriation</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.319" end="01:06:45.760" style="s2">of that concept uh jensen kim and i are</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.200" end="01:06:48.079" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.760" end="01:06:49.200" style="s2">writing a paper to really try and</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.079" end="01:06:51.920" style="s2">recapture</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.200" end="01:06:53.119" style="s2">uh the ecologically valid meaning of qi</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.920" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">within taoism</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.119" end="01:06:57.280" style="s2">and how that can actually be integrated</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">very uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.280" end="01:07:00.720" style="s2">i think very insightfully not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:02.000" style="s2">be self-congratulated but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">wrong way then</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.000" end="01:07:06.960" style="s2">but very significantly like it will have</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:08.280" style="s2">it fits together well that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.960" end="01:07:09.520" style="s2">trying to say sorry it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.280" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">self-congratulatory</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.520" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">but a way of reinterpreting</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">in an ecologically valid way the notion</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:18.960" style="s2">of chi or key</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:21.280" style="s2">that fits in plugs in really well</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.960" end="01:07:23.280" style="s2">to uh current cognitive science so that</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.280" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to think of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.280" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">like and it shouldn&#39;t be thought of</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:29.520" style="s2">because this is again a western category</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:31.599" style="s2">as a supernatural substance or as a um</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.520" end="01:07:33.680" style="s2">as some kind of ethereal ectoplasmic</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.599" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">force or all the guish</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.680" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">silliness that people have done um in</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:40.640" style="s2">their misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:42.079" style="s2">of that so um in the dallas tradition</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.640" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">your demon is is much more the</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.079" end="01:07:47.520" style="s2">experience of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:50.240" style="s2">chi or ki okay so that&#39;s a lot</p>
