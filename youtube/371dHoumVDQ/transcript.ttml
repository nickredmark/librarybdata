<p begin="00:00:07.069" end="00:00:14.150" style="s2">the last time I talked to Zach he quoted</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">his I think it was Rastafarians friend</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.150" end="00:00:19.109" style="s2">who said that school makes you stupid</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:24.230" style="s2">the money makes you poor and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:27.630" style="s2">medicine makes you sick so so Zach</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.230" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">Zach&#39;s been probably I would say Zach is</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.630" end="00:00:31.019" style="s2">more of an activist than you are John</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">but you&#39;re both working on different</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.019" end="00:00:36.750" style="s2">levels maybe of trying to figure things</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">out so can can you both can you both</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:46.140" style="s2">sort of give a short view of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:47.640" style="s2">education in the meaning crisis and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.140" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">your philosophies on education in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">general okay Zach do you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">first or sure please</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">totally thank you John it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.500" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">great to be here</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.219" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">and Andrew thank you as well it&#39;s thank</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:06.900" style="s2">you Kevin honor and so I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">think about the meaning crisis in terms</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:13.170" style="s2">of a broader meta-crisis that has these</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">four factors the meeting crisis is one</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.170" end="00:01:23.060" style="s2">and isn&#39;t perhaps the one that is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">most dire and painful in a sense and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.060" end="00:01:28.310" style="s2">aside aside from it though the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">three you also have what I&#39;m calling a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.310" end="00:01:33.509" style="s2">capability crisis all right so this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily about meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.509" end="00:01:39.740" style="s2">it&#39;s about people can&#39;t do the work that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">needs to be done is too complex or</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.740" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">because of the meaning crisis they never</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">gave a about it I&#39;ve never built</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">the skills ability screens right right</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">they so they can interact as what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">saying yeah and that&#39;s and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.509" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">deal the capability crisis because if</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">you can&#39;t do the stuff it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">done I don&#39;t like a logistical level</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">like maintaining infrastructure and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:06.750" style="s2">kind of stuff fighting disease you just</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do it could you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.750" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">ability crisis and then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:12.850" style="s2">what I&#39;m calling a sense making crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:14.620" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.850" end="00:02:16.390" style="s2">Johnathan rawl so-called after me</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.620" end="00:02:18.370" style="s2">something like an intelligibility crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.390" end="00:02:20.890" style="s2">mm-hmm which is again distinct from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.370" end="00:02:23.770" style="s2">meeting crisis but related and has to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.890" end="00:02:26.580" style="s2">with this sense that outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.770" end="00:02:28.600" style="s2">meaning-making there&#39;s also just</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.580" end="00:02:31.060" style="s2">intelligibility we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.600" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">everything is illegible we can&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.060" end="00:02:36.040" style="s2">too hyper objects are kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:37.660" style="s2">looming over us and the descends making</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.040" end="00:02:39.610" style="s2">crisis so that just like in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.660" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">what&#39;s the case objectively with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.610" end="00:02:45.670" style="s2">world that&#39;s up for grabs in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:47.620" style="s2">to the post truth and that cascades into</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.670" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">the meaning and then it&#39;s also cascades</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.620" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">in the capability because if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">think straight rather we&#39;ll began</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:54.490" style="s2">operating on it and then the fourth one</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:56.500" style="s2">is what I&#39;m calling the legitimation</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.490" end="00:02:58.420" style="s2">crisis yeah which i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.500" end="00:03:01.510" style="s2">important for the jedem Asian crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.420" end="00:03:03.910" style="s2">in the aspect of the political it has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.510" end="00:03:08.260" style="s2">do with basically who gets to wield</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.910" end="00:03:09.910" style="s2">authority and why and so and again</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.260" end="00:03:12.100" style="s2">they&#39;re all related but this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.910" end="00:03:15.370" style="s2">distinct insofar as it makes it so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.100" end="00:03:17.470" style="s2">we can&#39;t even decide who should be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.370" end="00:03:21.160" style="s2">charge and how the leadership should</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">function and we don&#39;t believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.160" end="00:03:26.980" style="s2">forms of political justification that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:28.960" style="s2">have been given misogyny so things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.980" end="00:03:30.910" style="s2">the breakdown in the belief of democracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.960" end="00:03:33.100" style="s2">in America is an example of legitimation</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.910" end="00:03:35.950" style="s2">process that&#39;ll turn me on so you said</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.100" end="00:03:38.590" style="s2">that political but you also oh sorry you</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.950" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">broke up I was saying that that term</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.590" end="00:03:42.700" style="s2">comes specifically from hotter boss</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:45.550" style="s2">legitimation Christmas you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.700" end="00:03:47.290" style="s2">Zach just a clarification question so</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.550" end="00:03:49.240" style="s2">you said it&#39;s largely political but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.290" end="00:03:50.980" style="s2">think that the disenfranchisement is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.240" end="00:03:53.980" style="s2">also in cultural institutions as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.980" end="00:03:56.020" style="s2">like established religions things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.980" end="00:03:57.430" style="s2">that is correct yeah precisely and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.020" end="00:04:00.760" style="s2">links in with my notion of teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.430" end="00:04:02.320" style="s2">authority right right very much a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.760" end="00:04:04.120" style="s2">and the authority structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.320" end="00:04:06.430" style="s2">Society of the whole it&#39;s most acute</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.120" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">often in politics but the university is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.430" end="00:04:10.240" style="s2">a huge issue</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:12.600" style="s2">yeah yeah our our expertise to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.240" end="00:04:14.880" style="s2">respected or not</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.600" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">so I wanted to ask you one question</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.880" end="00:04:18.090" style="s2">about that as you mentioned this before</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:19.350" style="s2">and I thought this was a well this way I</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.090" end="00:04:21.209" style="s2">sort of perked up when you said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.350" end="00:04:22.620" style="s2">not the other ideas aren&#39;t good but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.209" end="00:04:24.600" style="s2">realized last time you spoke to me about</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.620" end="00:04:27.960" style="s2">this I it&#39;s made me think quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.600" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">about it I was wondering if I&#39;m part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.960" end="00:04:33.350" style="s2">this so this is an open question</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:38.520" style="s2">I&#39;m not framing a cryptic position here</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.350" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">it is the idea that it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:42.810" style="s2">we&#39;re getting disenfranchisement is we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to adjudicate between</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.810" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">various institutions when they come into</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:50.220" style="s2">competition with each other um is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:52.230" style="s2">also part of what you mean by legit like</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.220" end="00:04:54.990" style="s2">so there isn&#39;t an overarching shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.230" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">normativity that allows us to adjudicate</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.990" end="00:05:00.210" style="s2">you know when because harbor mas seem to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:01.800" style="s2">think that right you know you have these</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.210" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">can he you know these autonomous spheres</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.800" end="00:05:06.750" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing that transcends them</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:07.920" style="s2">that decides how conflicts between them</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.750" end="00:05:09.180" style="s2">are supposed to be resolved is that also</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.920" end="00:05:11.910" style="s2">part of what you&#39;re thinking as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:14.190" style="s2">yeah in essence yeah that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.910" end="00:05:17.010" style="s2">seeing it was a as a complete fracturing</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.190" end="00:05:19.170" style="s2">yeah he was writing that I think is like</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.010" end="00:05:20.940" style="s2">72 legitimation crisis and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.170" end="00:05:23.310" style="s2">just that when post-modernism most</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.940" end="00:05:25.980" style="s2">beginning which is what in a sense this</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.310" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">is all about really it&#39;s not all about</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.980" end="00:05:29.940" style="s2">but it&#39;s a big factor with the breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">in hierarchical structures and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.940" end="00:05:32.570" style="s2">breakdowns and things like teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:34.980" style="s2">Authority and political authority</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.570" end="00:05:37.410" style="s2">normative Authority parental authority</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.980" end="00:05:39.210" style="s2">all kinds of Authority and power are</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.410" end="00:05:43.260" style="s2">become question power itself becomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.210" end="00:05:45.330" style="s2">problematic as from any sense have good</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.260" end="00:05:48.390" style="s2">connotations becomes hard to even think</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.330" end="00:05:51.060" style="s2">about and so under those conditions when</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.390" end="00:05:54.780" style="s2">you have that fourfold venner crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.060" end="00:05:56.580" style="s2">meaning crisis is in there then you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.780" end="00:05:58.170" style="s2">encapsulated also in this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.580" end="00:06:00.990" style="s2">intergenerational transmission being</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.170" end="00:06:02.940" style="s2">profoundly disrupted and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:05.160" style="s2">matter is this is an educational crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.940" end="00:06:09.270" style="s2">at its foundation only Worm those follow</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.160" end="00:06:10.440" style="s2">from a certain kind of failure in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.270" end="00:06:12.690" style="s2">dynamics of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.440" end="00:06:15.450" style="s2">transmission mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.690" end="00:06:17.190" style="s2">at least that&#39;s part of it and why</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.450" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">there&#39;s that failure why the generation</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.190" end="00:06:21.900" style="s2">gap becomes the way it is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.560" end="00:06:24.930" style="s2">interesting question but it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.900" end="00:06:26.940" style="s2">me not to see these as at their</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.930" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">foundation being part of an educational</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.940" end="00:06:33.419" style="s2">meta-crisis so that&#39;s my that&#39;s my and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:36.930" style="s2">your view on medic on education I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.419" end="00:06:39.660" style="s2">is larger than just schools right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.930" end="00:06:41.370" style="s2">I think that&#39;s very important like how</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.660" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">you talk in turn how you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.370" end="00:06:46.770" style="s2">magic education and so maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:49.560" style="s2">think about education what what how is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.770" end="00:06:51.300" style="s2">education operating today in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.560" end="00:06:53.850" style="s2">schools and then education outside of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.300" end="00:06:56.190" style="s2">schools like education that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.850" end="00:06:58.380" style="s2">like right now and in our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.190" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">and education that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.380" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">subcultures and everywhere else so so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:08.700" style="s2">John what does how does how does that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">ring that that fourfold kind of current</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.700" end="00:07:16.410" style="s2">crisis how does that match with your way</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:17.910" style="s2">of looking at things well I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:19.830" style="s2">said that I didn&#39;t think the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.910" end="00:07:22.139" style="s2">crisis was exclusive I thought the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.830" end="00:07:24.690" style="s2">crisis was interacting with the orphans</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.139" end="00:07:32.340" style="s2">idea of the meta-crisis and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.690" end="00:07:34.140" style="s2">Zac and I are already on convergence on</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.340" end="00:07:37.100" style="s2">that point as I just mentioned I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.140" end="00:07:40.289" style="s2">Zacks idea that he&#39;s taken over from</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.100" end="00:07:41.640" style="s2">Habermas and he&#39;s he&#39;s connecting it I</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.289" end="00:07:44.520" style="s2">think in really important ways of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.640" end="00:07:46.410" style="s2">legitimation crisis i yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.520" end="00:07:49.320" style="s2">I think that that makes total sense to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.410" end="00:07:53.910" style="s2">me I haven&#39;t said anything about it just</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.320" end="00:07:55.650" style="s2">just because I haven&#39;t had it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.910" end="00:07:59.400" style="s2">area that I&#39;ve devoted time and work do</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.650" end="00:07:59.880" style="s2">I so my neglect indicates nothing of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.400" end="00:08:03.300" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.880" end="00:08:04.590" style="s2">it&#39;s what I&#39;m saying about that and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.300" end="00:08:08.610" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s a pleasure to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.590" end="00:08:13.380" style="s2">Zack Bowden on the sense-making and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.610" end="00:08:15.270" style="s2">intelligibility issue that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.380" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">might I&#39;m not sure so this is maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.270" end="00:08:20.940" style="s2">open for discussion and it might overlap</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:22.889" style="s2">with an aspect something that I often</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.940" end="00:08:25.350" style="s2">pair with the meaning crisis although</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.889" end="00:08:28.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same and it would also</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.350" end="00:08:30.300" style="s2">relate to education so I often I also</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.200" end="00:08:31.470" style="s2">talk about the wisdom famine in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.300" end="00:08:33.270" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.470" end="00:08:35.580" style="s2">and it seems to me when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.270" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">about sense making if we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.580" end="00:08:39.630" style="s2">beyond just sort of the accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:41.729" style="s2">information that&#39;s been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.630" end="00:08:44.430" style="s2">institutionally vetted I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.729" end="00:08:45.810" style="s2">talking about you know the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.430" end="00:08:48.300" style="s2">make judgments the abilities of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.810" end="00:08:50.760" style="s2">discernment the ability to properly</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.300" end="00:08:54.360" style="s2">self-regulate in the face of information</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.760" end="00:08:58.260" style="s2">and problems and I think therefore there</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.360" end="00:09:00.750" style="s2">might be deep connections between wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.260" end="00:09:02.370" style="s2">or the wizard I call the wisdom famine</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.750" end="00:09:03.870" style="s2">which also has to do with some things</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.370" end="00:09:05.520" style="s2">I&#39;ve just mentioned the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.870" end="00:09:08.100" style="s2">intergenerational because part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.520" end="00:09:10.350" style="s2">say is we we&#39;ve lost our wisdom it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.100" end="00:09:12.510" style="s2">traditions or wisdom institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.350" end="00:09:13.500" style="s2">the connection to education is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.510" end="00:09:15.390" style="s2">way in which I think you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.500" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">understand wisdom as you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.390" end="00:09:21.030" style="s2">project of educating sense-making to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:25.310" style="s2">reduce self deception and manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.030" end="00:09:27.720" style="s2">by others and so there might I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.310" end="00:09:31.640" style="s2">that Jack and I might be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.720" end="00:09:34.230" style="s2">related in similar things there mm-hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.640" end="00:09:38.850" style="s2">excuse me they drop I also want to tie</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.230" end="00:09:40.650" style="s2">into Zacks notion of Education and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.850" end="00:09:44.820" style="s2">relate that to religion in a way and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.650" end="00:09:48.360" style="s2">you mentioned wisdom and so so you add</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.820" end="00:09:51.089" style="s2">John has a notion of religio right which</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.360" end="00:09:54.210" style="s2">is a bit distinct from religion proper</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.089" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">and and I&#39;ve heard that speak about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.210" end="00:09:59.820" style="s2">importance of let&#39;s say or we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:01.830" style="s2">talked Zack a little bit about how a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.820" end="00:10:04.860" style="s2">kind of there&#39;s a gonna be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.830" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">religious Renaissance going on so so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.860" end="00:10:09.810" style="s2">found that that John speaks about how</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:13.320" style="s2">we&#39;re not able to take religion</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.810" end="00:10:16.140" style="s2">seriously anymore and and and Zack has</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.320" end="00:10:18.180" style="s2">been saying that religion is becoming is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.140" end="00:10:20.460" style="s2">it&#39;s coming back kind of in spades or</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.180" end="00:10:21.780" style="s2">this is religio or religion or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.460" end="00:10:24.660" style="s2">you want to call it seems to be coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.780" end="00:10:27.930" style="s2">back and that that has to be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.660" end="00:10:32.280" style="s2">fused with with education does that ring</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.930" end="00:10:34.230" style="s2">true I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.280" end="00:10:35.970" style="s2">very opportune connection you just made</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.230" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">for having us the three together three</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.970" end="00:10:38.620" style="s2">together I&#39;d like that framing that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:43.990" style="s2">just gave</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.620" end="00:10:46.200" style="s2">I I guess what yeah I think when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.990" end="00:10:50.530" style="s2">using the term wisdom although I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.200" end="00:10:56.050" style="s2">mentioned discernment and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.530" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">judgment wisdom also has it within an</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.050" end="00:11:02.440" style="s2">aspiration and self transcendence as as</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:03.670" style="s2">integral to the notion and that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.440" end="00:11:06.250" style="s2">brings with it immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.670" end="00:11:08.650" style="s2">I think together these two notions of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.250" end="00:11:10.300" style="s2">Education broadly construed Plato set up</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.650" end="00:11:12.700" style="s2">the first school the first Academy</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.300" end="00:11:15.070" style="s2">literally right and it was for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.700" end="00:11:16.780" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom and it was spoke</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.070" end="00:11:20.620" style="s2">it was a place where you were supposed</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.780" end="00:11:22.420" style="s2">to be able to receive the affordance and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.620" end="00:11:24.940" style="s2">the guidance for the Socratic the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.420" end="00:11:26.770" style="s2">project of aspiring to Socratic wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.940" end="00:11:29.290" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s very clear but that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.770" end="00:11:32.140" style="s2">also brings in something that was also</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.290" end="00:11:34.660" style="s2">too pointed to by Plato which is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.140" end="00:11:37.690" style="s2">that self transcendence makes very</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.660" end="00:11:39.880" style="s2">little sense if people do not have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.690" end="00:11:41.100" style="s2">reverence for an order that transcends</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.880" end="00:11:44.380" style="s2">their ego centrism</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.100" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">if they do not have a sense of where I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.380" end="00:11:49.030" style="s2">mean by reverence a sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:53.410" style="s2">connected to something that is in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.030" end="00:11:56.290" style="s2">it it has a it is greater than them from</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.410" end="00:11:59.320" style="s2">which they can view their previous</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.290" end="00:12:01.180" style="s2">perspectives in a self corrective self</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.320" end="00:12:02.830" style="s2">transformative manner so I think if</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.180" end="00:12:04.450" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about wisdom wisdom we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.830" end="00:12:06.130" style="s2">talking about not just discernment and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.450" end="00:12:07.810" style="s2">judgment we&#39;re talking about aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.130" end="00:12:09.520" style="s2">or they&#39;re talking about aspirations to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.810" end="00:12:11.560" style="s2">self transcendence and that links us</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.520" end="00:12:15.280" style="s2">simultaneously on one hand to education</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.560" end="00:12:18.490" style="s2">and on the other hand to getting back</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.280" end="00:12:21.940" style="s2">that sense of connectedness to what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.490" end="00:12:25.180" style="s2">consider sacred that which puts us into</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:27.520" style="s2">connection with you know a greater</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.180" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">reality the inexhaustible nature of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.520" end="00:12:34.680" style="s2">reality and so I do I think that those</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">things are all tightly bound together</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.680" end="00:12:44.440" style="s2">tunneling I couldn&#39;t agree more and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:46.600" style="s2">know the I mean there&#39;s many many things</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.440" end="00:12:48.960" style="s2">to say I mean the the first schools or</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.600" end="00:12:51.030" style="s2">wisdom schools really yes you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.960" end="00:12:52.290" style="s2">and it was only much later that we got</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.030" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">this thing we know him as a school</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.290" end="00:12:56.450" style="s2">before that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">intergenerational transmission was</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.450" end="00:13:01.790" style="s2">religious family based etc but the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:04.860" style="s2">things that were built like in these</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.790" end="00:13:06.810" style="s2">places between worlds like outside in</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.860" end="00:13:09.720" style="s2">the wilderness between civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.810" end="00:13:11.490" style="s2">like on road when there wasn&#39;t code and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.720" end="00:13:14.820" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t norms you at this mystery</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.490" end="00:13:17.130" style="s2">school and yeah it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.820" end="00:13:18.780" style="s2">very very important concept education</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.130" end="00:13:21.510" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s easy to misconstrue</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.780" end="00:13:23.790" style="s2">it alive I really appreciated the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.510" end="00:13:25.590" style="s2">you construed it but much of the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.790" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">research I find kind of disappointing</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.590" end="00:13:31.710" style="s2">you know you know there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:33.510" style="s2">interesting to that that sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.710" end="00:13:35.370" style="s2">tied into the wisdom and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.510" end="00:13:37.620" style="s2">almost think about the different each of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.370" end="00:13:40.050" style="s2">the different of those four crises as</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.620" end="00:13:41.160" style="s2">having some resolution and certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.050" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">learning them in the realm of sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.160" end="00:13:48.900" style="s2">making it seems to be wisdom and it may</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:52.530" style="s2">be that wisdom operates on all of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.900" end="00:13:54.150" style="s2">in a helpful way but besides making in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.530" end="00:13:56.010" style="s2">particular because right right now one</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.150" end="00:13:59.310" style="s2">of the problems is that we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.010" end="00:14:00.450" style="s2">situations where it&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.310" end="00:14:02.760" style="s2">needs to be fixed</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.450" end="00:14:04.890" style="s2">in fact that the sense making needs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.760" end="00:14:07.320" style="s2">us to confront something that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.890" end="00:14:10.260" style="s2">understood perfectly in an objective way</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.320" end="00:14:11.880" style="s2">and so therefore we have to take the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.260" end="00:14:14.910" style="s2">forms of discernment and self</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.880" end="00:14:17.550" style="s2">transcendence in decision-making in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.910" end="00:14:19.500" style="s2">realm of objectivity and causality right</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.550" end="00:14:21.750" style="s2">and this is Borden&#39;s point without the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.500" end="00:14:24.960" style="s2">hyper object embarrasses the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.750" end="00:14:26.790" style="s2">function and we&#39;re we&#39;re left to be in</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.960" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">community with one another facing</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.790" end="00:14:33.750" style="s2">problems that are actually intractable</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">from a purely causal we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.750" end="00:14:37.980" style="s2">about choice and the basis of choice and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:40.770" style="s2">the weight choice works then you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.980" end="00:14:41.850" style="s2">the realm of wisdom and as I said last</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.770" end="00:14:43.410" style="s2">night with your Andrew yeah you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.850" end="00:14:44.910" style="s2">get an education without real living</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.410" end="00:14:48.020" style="s2">religion that&#39;s what I call them I</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.910" end="00:14:50.460" style="s2">actually met religio not like</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.020" end="00:14:52.530" style="s2">Catholicism that&#39;s working or but isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.460" end="00:14:55.380" style="s2">that&#39;s working but this actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.530" end="00:14:56.970" style="s2">transmission of wisdom yeah but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.380" end="00:14:58.680" style="s2">teacher-student that&#39;s the only way it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.970" end="00:15:00.290" style="s2">happens and right now that&#39;s what holds</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.680" end="00:15:03.859" style="s2">the education system together</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.290" end="00:15:09.470" style="s2">despite the education so I get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.859" end="00:15:11.660" style="s2">that you have you have more maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.470" end="00:15:15.049" style="s2">trying to think of the right word that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.660" end="00:15:17.449" style="s2">you have more affinity for for actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.049" end="00:15:19.850" style="s2">religion than John does or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.449" end="00:15:21.889" style="s2">like that or for the let&#39;s say the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.850" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">mythopoetic aspect of religion or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.889" end="00:15:30.759" style="s2">the wilder aspects of of religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">that&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.759" end="00:15:34.729" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:38.539" style="s2">John well enough to know that but I it</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.729" end="00:15:40.759" style="s2">maybe I mean I I really think that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.539" end="00:15:43.569" style="s2">religions are quite a remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.759" end="00:15:47.209" style="s2">cultural resource and so in that respect</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.569" end="00:15:48.919" style="s2">would never take the view that you find</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.209" end="00:15:50.449" style="s2">among the New Atheists and people of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.919" end="00:15:52.279" style="s2">that nature who think religion was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.449" end="00:15:54.889" style="s2">huge mistake I think it was not</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.279" end="00:15:58.579" style="s2">interesting I&#39;m not saying John thinks</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.889" end="00:16:00.769" style="s2">of this agency no no no yeah totally and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.579" end="00:16:03.229" style="s2">so but the question of how you bring it</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.769" end="00:16:05.629" style="s2">in to contemporary contexts is super</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.229" end="00:16:09.789" style="s2">loaded because it&#39;s very difficult in</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.629" end="00:16:13.069" style="s2">some rooms and in some cities and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.789" end="00:16:15.980" style="s2">cultural niches to use religion in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.069" end="00:16:19.939" style="s2">constructive way in fact it can only be</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.980" end="00:16:22.999" style="s2">perceived in a usually like a in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.939" end="00:16:24.980" style="s2">destructive way and so so I&#39;m sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.999" end="00:16:27.499" style="s2">to those dynamics but but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.980" end="00:16:30.379" style="s2">that there&#39;s a there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.499" end="00:16:32.600" style="s2">like there are typically loaded they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.379" end="00:16:34.249" style="s2">like are in terms of their over</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.600" end="00:16:36.980" style="s2">determined that like there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.249" end="00:16:40.220" style="s2">saturated with meaning and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.980" end="00:16:42.379" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be continued to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.220" end="00:16:44.329" style="s2">useful to humanity for an extremely long</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.379" end="00:16:46.369" style="s2">time and we need to come to terms with</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.329" end="00:16:49.309" style="s2">that well we&#39;ll never forget Jesus will</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.369" end="00:16:51.889" style="s2">ever forget but our Socrates for as long</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.309" end="00:16:56.539" style="s2">as what we know of as civilization</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.889" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">continues in any kind of way and for as</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.539" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">long as we think that we can some have</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:03.259" style="s2">overcome it entirely and create this</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:03.770" style="s2">conflict between let&#39;s say science and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.259" end="00:17:07.850" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.770" end="00:17:09.470" style="s2">that seems to me to be really weird like</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.850" end="00:17:10.580" style="s2">why are we doing that like for ratings</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.470" end="00:17:12.560" style="s2">or something you know like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.580" end="00:17:13.970" style="s2">make actual us that&#39;s the way that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.560" end="00:17:17.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a conflict between science and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.970" end="00:17:20.660" style="s2">religion so yeah so I you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.990" end="00:17:22.700" style="s2">suggesting again prayer in schools but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.660" end="00:17:25.040" style="s2">am suggesting that part of being</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.700" end="00:17:27.080" style="s2">educated is grappling with the key</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.040" end="00:17:28.880" style="s2">symbols and practices of the great</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.080" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">traditions with the kind of world</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.880" end="00:17:35.570" style="s2">spirituality that&#39;s Daphne and Oprah</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">called it or a new perennialism as a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.570" end="00:17:38.600" style="s2">to think about this which is some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.580" end="00:17:40.670" style="s2">work I&#39;m doing at the Center for</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.600" end="00:17:43.310" style="s2">integral wisdom Wow new perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.670" end="00:17:45.890" style="s2">yeah yeah so this is Gaffney&#39;s term that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.310" end="00:17:47.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve been building out as part of cosmo</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.890" end="00:17:50.030" style="s2">erotic humanism and the perennial list</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.780" end="00:17:51.650" style="s2">was an amazing movement and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.030" end="00:17:54.110" style="s2">all of a sudden taboo you know ken</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.650" end="00:17:57.770" style="s2">wilber was a Mentalist um there were</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.110" end="00:17:59.900" style="s2">many of them of course Huxley and so org</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.770" end="00:18:02.990" style="s2">and T Lee are having Louis goes on and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.900" end="00:18:08.990" style="s2">on but looking for those under key</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.990" end="00:18:10.430" style="s2">underlying dimensions and is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.990" end="00:18:11.870" style="s2">reconfiguring of education that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.430" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">necessary it&#39;s one of the key themes in</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:14.570" style="s2">my book it&#39;s like we need to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:17.720" style="s2">this a new form of relaunch</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.570" end="00:18:20.270" style="s2">excuse me religiosity and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.720" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">need to characterize the educational</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.270" end="00:18:26.330" style="s2">institutions of the future yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:30.290" style="s2">especially if in one piece and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.330" end="00:18:32.540" style="s2">and other things so do you agree with</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.290" end="00:18:35.570" style="s2">that John did I did I misconstrue</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.540" end="00:18:37.160" style="s2">something that you said or let me try</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.570" end="00:18:39.230" style="s2">and say what I don&#39;t know if you do I</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.160" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">did Andrew first of all I liked what</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.230" end="00:18:42.650" style="s2">exact just had to say although I want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:44.750" style="s2">I want to talk a bit of a perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.650" end="00:18:46.730" style="s2">in a bit I want to I want to know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.750" end="00:18:50.900" style="s2">new I want to know what&#39;s new and Neil</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.730" end="00:18:54.920" style="s2">perennialism differs it from I like</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.900" end="00:19:00.800" style="s2">Huxley and perennialism for example so</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.920" end="00:19:02.260" style="s2">we can come back to that I have a set of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.800" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">conference that I was just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.260" end="00:19:08.510" style="s2">you know that I was giving a argument</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:10.820" style="s2">that you cannot go through self transfer</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.510" end="00:19:12.980" style="s2">you cannot you you cannot use</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.820" end="00:19:15.350" style="s2">inferential computational procedures to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.980" end="00:19:19.060" style="s2">go through self transcendence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.350" end="00:19:19.060" style="s2">some very deep arguments</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.640" end="00:19:27.020" style="s2">and so I think I clearly articulated</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:29.510" style="s2">this goes towards your mythopoetic point</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.020" end="00:19:33.160" style="s2">entered that I think two things are</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.510" end="00:19:37.480" style="s2">really important for aspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.160" end="00:19:41.000" style="s2">self-transcendence serious play and us</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.480" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">symbolism where symbolism doesn&#39;t mean a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.000" end="00:19:50.060" style="s2">culture a cognitive ornamentation</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:53.060" style="s2">symbolism is a particularly of relating</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.060" end="00:19:57.560" style="s2">to the imaginal that allows us to move</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.060" end="00:20:00.440" style="s2">between John with this identity in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.560" end="00:20:03.320" style="s2">frame to that John with a new identity</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.440" end="00:20:05.930" style="s2">in that frame which is what taught what</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.320" end="00:20:08.540" style="s2">we need to be talking about John is</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.930" end="00:20:10.760" style="s2">talking about he&#39;s aspiring to how to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.540" end="00:20:12.140" style="s2">and to write and to be in a world</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.760" end="00:20:13.610" style="s2">because it&#39;s always existential that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.140" end="00:20:16.540" style="s2">he&#39;s not in now when he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.610" end="00:20:20.360" style="s2">things like wisdom I mean or rationality</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.540" end="00:20:22.460" style="s2">I&#39;m aspiring I&#39;m aspiring to an identity</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.360" end="00:20:23.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t have and a way of seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:25.940" style="s2">understanding things that I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.930" end="00:20:28.610" style="s2">now I&#39;m aspiring to a more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.940" end="00:20:31.460" style="s2">frame and I need something that&#39;s Jane</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.610" end="00:20:36.110" style="s2">is faced in that liminal place between</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.460" end="00:20:39.320" style="s2">so that I can keep I can write it can</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.110" end="00:20:42.760" style="s2">reach me in this frame but it can lift</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.320" end="00:20:45.740" style="s2">me towards the next frame so I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.760" end="00:20:48.350" style="s2">symbolic activity is really important I</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.740" end="00:20:50.120" style="s2">think serious play is really important</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.350" end="00:20:52.580" style="s2">and my prototypical example of serious</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.120" end="00:20:55.820" style="s2">play is ritual serious play is how we go</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.580" end="00:20:59.960" style="s2">into and play with that space between</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.820" end="00:21:03.170" style="s2">identities and worlds so that we can get</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.960" end="00:21:05.150" style="s2">a taste of what it would be like to what</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.170" end="00:21:07.040" style="s2">it would be like to be in that world and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.150" end="00:21:09.530" style="s2">have that identity without fully</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.040" end="00:21:10.820" style="s2">committing to it then I was in my toe in</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.530" end="00:21:12.710" style="s2">the talk I just gave I was pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.820" end="00:21:16.040" style="s2">about all these emerging forms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.710" end="00:21:18.920" style="s2">serious play and ritual like Jeep</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.040" end="00:21:21.170" style="s2">forming in Scandinavia where people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.920" end="00:21:22.370" style="s2">doing live-action role-playing and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.170" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.370" end="00:21:27.230" style="s2">create a situation where they&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">not doing Dungeons &amp; Dragons what</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.230" end="00:21:31.059" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is enacting a real-life</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:32.950" style="s2">situations</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.059" end="00:21:34.419" style="s2">and the Dungeon Master is actually like</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.950" end="00:21:36.370" style="s2">the director that will get them to cut</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.419" end="00:21:39.129" style="s2">scenes and switch roles and give them</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.370" end="00:21:40.629" style="s2">various props and the phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.129" end="00:21:43.240" style="s2">they&#39;re seeking is the phenomenon called</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.629" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">bleed and what they&#39;re after and bleed</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.240" end="00:21:46.929" style="s2">is that the distinction between what</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:49.210" style="s2">they&#39;re doing in their pretense of game</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.929" end="00:21:52.899" style="s2">and their real life that boundary bleeds</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.210" end="00:21:55.029" style="s2">so they&#39;re getting a taste on what this</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.899" end="00:21:58.269" style="s2">could be like in their real life well</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.029" end="00:22:00.029" style="s2">that it took for me is deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.269" end="00:22:03.610" style="s2">analogous although it&#39;s taking place</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.029" end="00:22:05.830" style="s2">formally with in a secular discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.610" end="00:22:08.110" style="s2">people who consider them suck that is so</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.830" end="00:22:09.879" style="s2">similar to what people do when they went</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.110" end="00:22:12.429" style="s2">into church right that kind of serious</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.879" end="00:22:14.289" style="s2">play that kind of ritual I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.429" end="00:22:16.029" style="s2">going in like the you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.289" end="00:22:18.639" style="s2">playing with identities you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.029" end="00:22:21.580" style="s2">with alternative frameworks other than</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.639" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">your your own and you&#39;re doing this all</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.580" end="00:22:25.149" style="s2">within active symbolism think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:28.059" style="s2">baptism for example within the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.149" end="00:22:29.679" style="s2">complex so I thought oh what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.059" end="00:22:31.149" style="s2">difference then sorry to interrupt like</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.679" end="00:22:33.940" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s the difference here</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.149" end="00:22:35.799" style="s2">between well you know is it who was it</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.940" end="00:22:37.809" style="s2">who said everything is religion in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.799" end="00:22:39.580" style="s2">sense like well well then Dimity I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.809" end="00:22:42.129" style="s2">want to do that didn&#39;t become a useless</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.580" end="00:22:47.409" style="s2">category right I don&#39;t think everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.129" end="00:22:51.249" style="s2">is what the difference is and this comes</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.409" end="00:22:53.980" style="s2">up and I want to address that point you</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.249" end="00:22:55.720" style="s2">know the new atheist assumed that most</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.980" end="00:22:58.450" style="s2">of the people that are the nuns the enno</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.720" end="00:23:00.669" style="s2">nes are basically they&#39;ve been convinced</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.450" end="00:23:02.980" style="s2">of the falsity of religion and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.669" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">all atheists but that is overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.980" end="00:23:09.369" style="s2">not the case only about 10% of those</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:12.570" style="s2">people self-identify as atheist many of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.369" end="00:23:14.769" style="s2">them you know have you know really crazy</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.570" end="00:23:17.470" style="s2">worldviews and they have you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.769" end="00:23:19.509" style="s2">hodgepodge of spiritual practices the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.470" end="00:23:21.580" style="s2">hunger for self transcendence the hunger</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.509" end="00:23:24.369" style="s2">for serious play the hunger for ritual</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.580" end="00:23:26.769" style="s2">all right and the hunger to get outside</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.369" end="00:23:29.110" style="s2">of the the prison of the ego these</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.769" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">disease all use X terms these are</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.110" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">perennial these these don&#39;t go away but</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:38.350" style="s2">what&#39;s different between the nuns right</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:42.100" style="s2">and people who would identify as</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.350" end="00:23:46.150" style="s2">religious has to do with commitment</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.100" end="00:23:49.960" style="s2">right two particular institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.150" end="00:23:51.760" style="s2">particulars of propositions I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.960" end="00:23:53.860" style="s2">think we should pay very careful</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.760" end="00:23:56.350" style="s2">attention to their religions</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.860" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">in terms of how they can be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.350" end="00:24:01.960" style="s2">sources for ecology keys of practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:03.700" style="s2">that we should pay very careful</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.960" end="00:24:08.260" style="s2">attention to when we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.700" end="00:24:11.830" style="s2">cultivate ecologies of practices but for</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.260" end="00:24:15.790" style="s2">me those religions are off have been</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.830" end="00:24:17.290" style="s2">often bound up with and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.790" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">and there&#39;s a spectrum here from liberal</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.290" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">to fundamentalist so I am acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.940" end="00:24:23.920" style="s2">the spectrum right now but right</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:25.630" style="s2">they&#39;ve been but let&#39;s but they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.920" end="00:24:27.550" style="s2">often been bound up with adherence to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.630" end="00:24:30.450" style="s2">particular sets of doctrines about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.550" end="00:24:34.570" style="s2">metaphysical structure of a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.450" end="00:24:37.660" style="s2">and I find the metaphysical structure of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.570" end="00:24:38.890" style="s2">many of these worldviews well first of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.660" end="00:24:40.390" style="s2">all speak on behalf for the nuns because</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.890" end="00:24:42.340" style="s2">they have brought it up they find that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.390" end="00:24:44.110" style="s2">metaphysical structure and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.340" end="00:24:46.450" style="s2">institutions that identify with it they</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.110" end="00:24:48.070" style="s2">find it my enviable they do it just it</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.450" end="00:24:51.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t catch them it doesn&#39;t resonate</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.070" end="00:24:53.290" style="s2">with them for it feels to me that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.880" end="00:24:55.420" style="s2">kind of a no-man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.290" end="00:24:57.790" style="s2">it&#39;s like either you make it all up as</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.420" end="00:25:00.550" style="s2">you go along or you&#39;re you&#39;re trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.790" end="00:25:01.810" style="s2">some kind of formal structure well well</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.550" end="00:25:03.280" style="s2">you can understand why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.810" end="00:25:08.260" style="s2">traumatized right they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.280" end="00:25:10.510" style="s2">traumatized by the fact in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.260" end="00:25:12.070" style="s2">secular alternatives drench the world in</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.510" end="00:25:14.820" style="s2">blood and so they don&#39;t want to belong</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.070" end="00:25:20.650" style="s2">to put you know big political machines</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.820" end="00:25:23.380" style="s2">but they many of them have seen the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.650" end="00:25:25.750" style="s2">various religions traditions fragment</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.380" end="00:25:30.760" style="s2">around them and be admired in</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.750" end="00:25:34.090" style="s2">controversy and scandal and also too</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.760" end="00:25:35.830" style="s2">often many people myself included have</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.090" end="00:25:38.440" style="s2">you know have suffered personal psycho</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.830" end="00:25:41.020" style="s2">psychodynamic trauma at the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.440" end="00:25:43.060" style="s2">established religions and so they feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.020" end="00:25:44.800" style="s2">they make a mistake I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.060" end="00:25:46.420" style="s2">mistake but I want to explain what well</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.800" end="00:25:49.090" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an understandable mistake</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.420" end="00:25:51.910" style="s2">they think allegiance to any group or</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.090" end="00:25:53.800" style="s2">any tradition will automatically make</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.910" end="00:25:54.380" style="s2">them vulnerable to all of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.800" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2">terror</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.380" end="00:25:59.179" style="s2">once again what they don&#39;t acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:01.460" style="s2">enough and I think what you put your</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.179" end="00:26:04.549" style="s2">finger on is that that autodidactic</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.460" end="00:26:09.350" style="s2">fragmented thing is really really prone</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.549" end="00:26:11.720" style="s2">to self-deception and all kinds of you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.350" end="00:26:13.130" style="s2">know which you see if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.720" end="00:26:15.410" style="s2">actually look at sort of the things they</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.130" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">espouse and the and the practices they</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.410" end="00:26:20.690" style="s2">try to cobble together yeah I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:23.299" style="s2">of Zach&#39;s term a teachable Authority the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.690" end="00:26:27.080" style="s2">crisis of teacherly authority as being</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.299" end="00:26:32.900" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m a key right here like we need</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.080" end="00:26:33.740" style="s2">teachers right we need hmm do you want</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.900" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">to comment on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.740" end="00:26:40.549" style="s2">so yeah I mean I agree with with John I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:42.140" style="s2">mean I think the the issue of what to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.549" end="00:26:43.669" style="s2">with the religions is a big one because</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.140" end="00:26:47.510" style="s2">they&#39;ve been massively problematic</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.669" end="00:26:50.470" style="s2">they&#39;ve also drenched the world in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.510" end="00:26:53.059" style="s2">drama that has many many many people and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.470" end="00:26:54.710" style="s2">and so yeah it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.059" end="00:26:57.620" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s easy to compare</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.710" end="00:26:59.750" style="s2">like the worst religious discourse to</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.620" end="00:27:01.970" style="s2">like the best scientific discourse well</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.750" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">correct we need to look at the best</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.970" end="00:27:05.960" style="s2">religious discourse yeah and we could</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.010" end="00:27:28.100" style="s2">a whole complicated conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.570" end="00:27:29.960" style="s2">has to do with critical theory and</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s interesting to me then you</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.299" end="00:28:12.750" style="s2">look how that&#39;s become an educational</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:15.070" style="s2">thing that the largest reforms in</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.750" end="00:28:17.950" style="s2">schools in the United States were on the</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.720" end="00:28:24.190" style="s2">or I even ideology they were motivated</p>

<p begin="00:28:24.190" end="00:28:28.840" style="s2">Russians since right after Sputnik has</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:44.890" style="s2">but part of me wants to look again that</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.290" end="00:28:46.350" style="s2">the things we used to worship before and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.890" end="00:28:47.470" style="s2">think about how we can get</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.350" end="00:28:49.929" style="s2">self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.470" end="00:28:51.850" style="s2">as you&#39;re describing Jon like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.929" end="00:28:54.510" style="s2">actually have the archetypes to step</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.850" end="00:28:56.980" style="s2">into the mystery schools were theaters</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.510" end="00:28:58.780" style="s2">right to your point about the role</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.980" end="00:29:01.540" style="s2">playing and the seer display their</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.780" end="00:29:04.510" style="s2">mystery schools were theaters and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.540" end="00:29:09.700" style="s2">many is the initiation rites that went</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.510" end="00:29:12.100" style="s2">down were theatric and the ritual being</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.700" end="00:29:14.200" style="s2">like the mass being the living symbol</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.100" end="00:29:16.660" style="s2">then right up to Steiner who actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.200" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">resuscitated some of those it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.660" end="00:29:23.620" style="s2">attrex to encode a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:27.130" style="s2">initiation ceremony and so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:30.240" style="s2">seeing some need to find a way you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.130" end="00:29:35.140" style="s2">some needs to work with these symbols</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.240" end="00:29:38.500" style="s2">and to kind of grapple with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.140" end="00:29:43.150" style="s2">resurgence of religion which could be an</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.500" end="00:29:45.790" style="s2">invitation to refine it so again and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.150" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">difference between the theatrics of non</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.790" end="00:29:48.549" style="s2">religion and the theatrics of religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:50.470" style="s2">let&#39;s say if we want to call it the at</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.549" end="00:29:53.500" style="s2">record through kind of ritual right</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.470" end="00:29:57.640" style="s2">would be something to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.500" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">historicity of the religious right when</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.640" end="00:30:04.540" style="s2">I chant Hebrew chant this has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:06.070" style="s2">chanted for thousands of years when I</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.540" end="00:30:07.540" style="s2">make up a chant with my friends and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.070" end="00:30:08.950" style="s2">chant then we take it very seriously and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.540" end="00:30:10.390" style="s2">we can get into an altered state that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.950" end="00:30:12.760" style="s2">the chant has not been chanted for</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.390" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">thousands of years by humans mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.760" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s the transmission that you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:18.040" style="s2">speaking about it&#39;s something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:20.680" style="s2">transmission</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.040" end="00:30:23.230" style="s2">it&#39;s something to do with La Scala more</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.680" end="00:30:24.490" style="s2">for genetic fields if I can bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.230" end="00:30:26.830" style="s2">Michelle Drake into the room which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.490" end="00:30:29.770" style="s2">perhaps controversial at least to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.830" end="00:30:32.800" style="s2">scientism ground but it has so it has to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.770" end="00:30:36.340" style="s2">do with the insole meant of humanity as</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.800" end="00:30:38.470" style="s2">an ontological factor which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.340" end="00:30:42.310" style="s2">that even in a whitehead Ian sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.470" end="00:30:45.460" style="s2">moving through a sequence and there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.310" end="00:30:49.480" style="s2">patterns that remain and so we step into</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.460" end="00:30:53.380" style="s2">temples in space and temples in time and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.480" end="00:30:54.400" style="s2">so the ritual can create those you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.380" end="00:30:56.560" style="s2">this is one of the notions of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.400" end="00:30:59.620" style="s2">Sabbath right that it&#39;s not a temple in</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.560" end="00:31:02.950" style="s2">space it&#39;s a temple in time and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.620" end="00:31:05.230" style="s2">been made for thousands of years so</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.950" end="00:31:07.750" style="s2">that&#39;s different from creating a focal</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.230" end="00:31:09.700" style="s2">space to do Improv Theater and as</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.750" end="00:31:12.850" style="s2">amazing as that is as important as on</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.700" end="00:31:16.630" style="s2">this to do in that space a ritual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.850" end="00:31:20.980" style="s2">been done for thousands of years it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.630" end="00:31:24.490" style="s2">different and so so yeah and can schools</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.980" end="00:31:25.750" style="s2">plug into that in any way right schools</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.490" end="00:31:26.950" style="s2">the United States don&#39;t plug into that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.750" end="00:31:28.870" style="s2">we plug into your additions that are a</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.950" end="00:31:31.630" style="s2">couple hundred years old at best and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.870" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">don&#39;t even really buy them like the you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.630" end="00:31:35.950" style="s2">know saluting the flag and on defense so</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:38.800" style="s2">the question of how to unite humanity</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.950" end="00:31:42.130" style="s2">again around things it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.800" end="00:31:44.350" style="s2">one and right now we&#39;re desperate for it</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.130" end="00:31:46.200" style="s2">we&#39;re super longing for like the Super</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.350" end="00:31:49.330" style="s2">Bowl and other things these spectacles</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.200" end="00:31:50.650" style="s2">we put in made-up holidays Valentine&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.330" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">Day other things we put so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.650" end="00:31:54.370" style="s2">attention into these things because we</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:56.980" style="s2">want something that&#39;s what we must</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.370" end="00:31:59.170" style="s2">remember together that&#39;s meaningful also</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.980" end="00:32:02.170" style="s2">the virtual Exodus how much how often</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.740" end="00:34:04.360" style="s2">science and the debate between like for</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.179" end="00:34:07.960" style="s2">men and cats I won&#39;t burden the viewers</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.360" end="00:34:11.620" style="s2">with all of that but there here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.960" end="00:34:14.110" style="s2">want to say I guess I see perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.620" end="00:34:16.540" style="s2">as pointing to what&#39;s importantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.110" end="00:34:19.350" style="s2">invariant and I see the constructivist</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.540" end="00:34:23.409" style="s2">pointing to what is importantly varied</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.350" end="00:34:26.139" style="s2">and deep learning actually cycles</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.409" end="00:34:28.570" style="s2">between those two you you extract what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.139" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">invariant and then you have to know how</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.570" end="00:34:32.139" style="s2">to vary it so that you get appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:34.600" style="s2">fitted it to many different environments</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.139" end="00:34:38.889" style="s2">and you need to be able to move very</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.600" end="00:34:41.740" style="s2">effectively between you know compression</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.889" end="00:34:43.270" style="s2">for what&#39;s invariant and generation of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.740" end="00:34:44.600" style="s2">variation I mean that&#39;s how evolution</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.270" end="00:34:47.870" style="s2">biological evolution for</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.600" end="00:34:49.130" style="s2">simple works and of course I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.870" end="00:34:52.100" style="s2">ultimately that has to do with things</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.130" end="00:34:53.960" style="s2">about relevance realization so that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.100" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">might bring this up as I can explain</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.960" end="00:34:59.330" style="s2">this idea with Jordan Hall and some of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:35:02.690" style="s2">our discussions that maybe could we get</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.330" end="00:35:03.770" style="s2">past that that way of thinking the you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.690" end="00:35:05.240" style="s2">know perennial list versus</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.770" end="00:35:07.550" style="s2">constructivist and instead of go to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.240" end="00:35:09.590" style="s2">dynamic model where what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.550" end="00:35:13.310" style="s2">do is not say no what people should be</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.590" end="00:35:15.350" style="s2">doing instead of trying to get a stable</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.310" end="00:35:18.980" style="s2">set of doctrines what we should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.350" end="00:35:21.470" style="s2">is teaching people again an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.980" end="00:35:24.200" style="s2">practices that allows them right to</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.470" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">extract what&#39;s invariant but also then</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.200" end="00:35:28.460" style="s2">run right to learn how to make run the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">variations off of it so they actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.460" end="00:35:34.310" style="s2">get this they actually instantiate the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:37.220" style="s2">adaptivity rather than trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.310" end="00:35:39.080" style="s2">through the my criticism I like Huxley</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.220" end="00:35:42.340" style="s2">by the way we have a family okay you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.080" end="00:35:45.500" style="s2">know I mean how can you not like right</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.340" end="00:35:46.970" style="s2">and you should and I and what I might</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.500" end="00:35:47.900" style="s2">say next might be a little bit unfair to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.970" end="00:35:49.850" style="s2">actually because you should read the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.900" end="00:35:51.740" style="s2">doors of perception alongside the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.850" end="00:35:54.050" style="s2">perennial philosophy but if you read</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.740" end="00:35:56.120" style="s2">just the perennial philosophy it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.050" end="00:35:57.350" style="s2">it&#39;s and how could it not be again I</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.120" end="00:35:58.790" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be unfair to because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.350" end="00:36:00.350" style="s2">a book but you can get the impression</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.790" end="00:36:02.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s about trying to find the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.350" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">shared doctrines their shared</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.360" end="00:36:07.850" style="s2">propositions and tomorrow in mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:10.190" style="s2">um this is this is this is still a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.850" end="00:36:13.550" style="s2">problematic way of thinking that what</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.190" end="00:36:16.520" style="s2">what we need to be doing is not trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.550" end="00:36:19.370" style="s2">to find the perennial propositions what</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.520" end="00:36:22.940" style="s2">we need to do is affording people like I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.370" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">said that process of well can you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.940" end="00:36:27.170" style="s2">you look at all these traditions then</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:29.990" style="s2">draw out what&#39;s invariant and then also</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.170" end="00:36:32.060" style="s2">can you go back and in this context it</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.990" end="00:36:33.800" style="s2">becomes this way and this context</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.060" end="00:36:36.110" style="s2">becomes this one you see my model for</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.800" end="00:36:38.390" style="s2">this is Socrates what&#39;s impresses about</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.110" end="00:36:39.920" style="s2">Socrates seems to be like he&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.390" end="00:36:41.300" style="s2">know what it looks like his although</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.920" end="00:36:43.580" style="s2">he&#39;s looking for his definition so</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.300" end="00:36:45.050" style="s2">that&#39;s not right there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.580" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">part of what Socrates is doing is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.050" end="00:36:47.720" style="s2">trying to he&#39;s trying to get what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">invariant but you know it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.720" end="00:36:53.210" style="s2">masterful about Socrates how he buries</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:53.870" style="s2">that to whomever he&#39;s talking to right</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.210" end="00:36:55.490" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.870" end="00:36:57.770" style="s2">that&#39;s what makes him the great teacher</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.490" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">not just the abstraction of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.770" end="00:37:00.980" style="s2">Sumerian</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:03.950" style="s2">but the generative the creative ability</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.980" end="00:37:06.140" style="s2">to vary it as needed and those two are</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.950" end="00:37:09.730" style="s2">constantly cycling right when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.140" end="00:37:14.029" style="s2">doing engaged in deep learning so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.730" end="00:37:15.499" style="s2">that&#39;s why I don&#39;t I sort of don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.029" end="00:37:18.289" style="s2">identify as apprenticed or a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.499" end="00:37:20.930" style="s2">constructivist I think I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.289" end="00:37:23.059" style="s2">trying to try to break out of that at</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.930" end="00:37:25.460" style="s2">least how I see that often argued about</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.059" end="00:37:28.009" style="s2">and discussed and I wondered what this</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.460" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">what this might say how it could enter</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.009" end="00:37:30.380" style="s2">into dialogue with what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:34.549" style="s2">about the document you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.380" end="00:37:35.539" style="s2">sort of a new perennialism Elena and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.549" end="00:37:38.150" style="s2">kind of let the cat out of the bag</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.539" end="00:37:39.950" style="s2">because that was that&#39;s gotta mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.150" end="00:37:40.819" style="s2">work he&#39;s been working on this for about</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.950" end="00:37:42.259" style="s2">a year and I&#39;ve been in close</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.819" end="00:37:44.210" style="s2">conversation with him Ken Wilbur&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.259" end="00:37:48.140" style="s2">in close conversation and but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.210" end="00:37:51.559" style="s2">very real need to get beyond that false</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.140" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">dichotomy and to see that even the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.559" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">staunchest constructivist admit that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:59.180" style="s2">there is some commonality and even the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:00.499" style="s2">staunchest people looking at</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.180" end="00:38:02.269" style="s2">commonalities are the first thing they</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.499" end="00:38:04.970" style="s2">say is that what different engines are</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.269" end="00:38:06.529" style="s2">all different so it&#39;s it&#39;s actually been</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.970" end="00:38:07.789" style="s2">a false debate for a long time again one</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.529" end="00:38:09.650" style="s2">of those things that&#39;s like it&#39;s is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.789" end="00:38:11.089" style="s2">for ratings or why why are we making</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.650" end="00:38:14.239" style="s2">this such a big deal why can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.089" end="00:38:18.259" style="s2">actually agree here because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.239" end="00:38:19.940" style="s2">tremendous amount of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.259" end="00:38:22.339" style="s2">tremendous amount of important work to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.940" end="00:38:23.390" style="s2">do in that domain and so I&#39;m loving what</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.339" end="00:38:25.700" style="s2">you and Jordan are saying we share</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.390" end="00:38:27.410" style="s2">Jordan as interlocutor and yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.700" end="00:38:30.920" style="s2">a sense in which I&#39;m at you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.410" end="00:38:32.150" style="s2">friendly way and there&#39;s a yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.920" end="00:38:34.309" style="s2">a sense in which what you&#39;re getting out</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.150" end="00:38:38.109" style="s2">to as a developmental issue that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.309" end="00:38:40.910" style="s2">a ability to work at a level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.109" end="00:38:42.970" style="s2">abstraction and complexity complexity</p>

<p begin="00:38:42.970" end="00:38:49.460" style="s2">propositions that does allow like the</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.460" end="00:38:55.549" style="s2">for one&#39;s own making one&#39;s own personal</p>

<p begin="00:38:55.549" end="00:39:02.509" style="s2">yourself basically no and so but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.569" end="00:39:07.749" style="s2">a quite a hefty task demand on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.509" end="00:39:07.749" style="s2">individual and what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.779" end="00:39:10.119" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.980" end="00:39:11.830" style="s2">when you start breaching the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.119" end="00:39:13.900" style="s2">constructivist view with the prettiest</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.830" end="00:39:16.720" style="s2">view and you start to see what it would</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.900" end="00:39:18.660" style="s2">look like to have both somehow you end</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:21.490" style="s2">up with that as the educational</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.660" end="00:39:22.840" style="s2">recommendation so outside of what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.490" end="00:39:24.100" style="s2">looks like theoretically it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.840" end="00:39:26.740" style="s2">I&#39;m not in the fury anymore I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.100" end="00:39:30.030" style="s2">about in ecology of practice I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.740" end="00:39:32.710" style="s2">to create yeah we write informed by the</p>

<p begin="00:39:32.710" end="00:39:36.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of other things to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.359" end="00:39:40.150" style="s2">say about it which I&#39;ll leave for one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.550" end="00:39:41.350" style="s2">the books basically you know but one one</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.150" end="00:39:45.550" style="s2">of them is basically that there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.350" end="00:39:47.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a common sense there&#39;s a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.100" end="00:39:52.780" style="s2">Givens and so these are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.840" end="00:39:55.210" style="s2">in socrates epitomize them these are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.780" end="00:39:58.030" style="s2">kind of natural working of the human</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.210" end="00:40:01.090" style="s2">that moves into the realms that would</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.030" end="00:40:03.640" style="s2">create a religion right and like what is</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.640" end="00:40:08.320" style="s2">leads up and through those are very</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.320" end="00:40:12.040" style="s2">which you&#39;re identifying John which are</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.609" end="00:40:16.359" style="s2">like the underlying structural features</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.040" end="00:40:19.150" style="s2">of religiosity and so being able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.359" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">distill some of that and saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.150" end="00:40:22.300" style="s2">result of that in almost any domain</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:24.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve started to see things like first</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.300" end="00:40:25.960" style="s2">hand for like life matters I got this</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.700" end="00:40:29.800" style="s2">interesting proposition</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.960" end="00:40:33.250" style="s2">let me first is about right that third</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.800" end="00:40:35.470" style="s2">is right and wrong these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.250" end="00:40:37.869" style="s2">like not not here&#39;s what&#39;s right here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.470" end="00:40:40.450" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong can&#39;t say that but that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.869" end="00:40:42.340" style="s2">there is right and wrong right so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.450" end="00:40:45.580" style="s2">start to get to these anthro ontological</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.340" end="00:40:48.280" style="s2">Givens and you start to be able to look</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.580" end="00:40:50.410" style="s2">to work with them in different contexts</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.280" end="00:40:52.500" style="s2">and at you end up getting something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.410" end="00:40:56.130" style="s2">looks like a set of propositions</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.500" end="00:40:59.230" style="s2">eventually but also like a way to craft</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.130" end="00:41:02.230" style="s2">Ecology&#39;s of practice after that people</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.230" end="00:41:03.930" style="s2">can have a refined perception and those</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.230" end="00:41:06.040" style="s2">become things that they could prove</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.930" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">basically instead of things they have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.040" end="00:41:12.970" style="s2">believe and so so yeah so I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:14.350" style="s2">working in it from similar angles we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.970" end="00:41:17.080" style="s2">coming in from different sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.350" end="00:41:19.450" style="s2">mountain to some three in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.080" end="00:41:22.330" style="s2">and you know maybe we&#39;re taking the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.450" end="00:41:26.010" style="s2">faster longer route but you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.330" end="00:41:28.930" style="s2">like this direct route and the yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.010" end="00:41:32.200" style="s2">so I think yeah we&#39;re talking in similar</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.930" end="00:41:34.270" style="s2">similar vein here that feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.200" end="00:41:37.870" style="s2">convergence in the sense that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.270" end="00:41:40.390" style="s2">talking about Commandments or rules of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.870" end="00:41:42.310" style="s2">behavior but you&#39;re talking about some</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.390" end="00:41:45.700" style="s2">kind of that something more dynamic or</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.310" end="00:41:49.660" style="s2">something more something edgy or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.700" end="00:41:52.020" style="s2">it&#39;s educative and yeah sorry did I cut</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.660" end="00:41:54.940" style="s2">you off that couldn&#39;t mean - no I please</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.020" end="00:41:56.500" style="s2">well I was just gonna say I yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.940" end="00:41:59.110" style="s2">so and it comes back to this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.500" end="00:42:01.270" style="s2">serious play yeah I think if Sinclair&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.110" end="00:42:04.810" style="s2">work on we actually watch how children</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.270" end="00:42:07.240" style="s2">learn you see if you see you see this</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.810" end="00:42:09.370" style="s2">dynamic process let&#39;s say they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.240" end="00:42:11.050" style="s2">to learn something for solving a set of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.370" end="00:42:14.830" style="s2">problems to achieve some goal they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.050" end="00:42:16.660" style="s2">come up with a strategy for it right but</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.830" end="00:42:18.280" style="s2">what will they do is they will they will</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.660" end="00:42:20.230" style="s2">they don&#39;t stick with that strategy</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.280" end="00:42:21.940" style="s2">initially and this is what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.230" end="00:42:24.310" style="s2">play they will generate all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.940" end="00:42:25.870" style="s2">variations on the strategy and then they</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.310" end="00:42:27.400" style="s2">will put the strategies into competition</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.870" end="00:42:29.020" style="s2">with each other and then they&#39;ll until</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.400" end="00:42:31.270" style="s2">they get one that sort of wins that out</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.020" end="00:42:33.370" style="s2">and then they go with that right and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.270" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">so what I&#39;m saying is you see this</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.370" end="00:42:38.530" style="s2">movement of they&#39;ll update here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:39.850" style="s2">situation they abstract some invariant</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.530" end="00:42:41.320" style="s2">thing they come up with a strategy but</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.850" end="00:42:43.750" style="s2">then they don&#39;t stop there then they do</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.320" end="00:42:45.310" style="s2">this generative variation right and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.750" end="00:42:49.360" style="s2">they keep cycling and cycling and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.310" end="00:42:50.710" style="s2">cycling and cycling and I want I want I</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.360" end="00:42:52.930" style="s2">guess what I&#39;m trying to say and you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.710" end="00:42:55.330" style="s2">the same thing in you know in Hinton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.930" end="00:42:56.920" style="s2">deep deep learning that&#39;s how these</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.330" end="00:43:02.850" style="s2">things work they they cycle between</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.920" end="00:43:05.710" style="s2">compression and particularization I want</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.850" end="00:43:08.650" style="s2">to put an emphasis on keeping the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.710" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">cycling going rather than trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.650" end="00:43:14.520" style="s2">stabilize it into a complete set of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:18.790" style="s2">propositions that have sort of resolved</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.520" end="00:43:20.350" style="s2">you know the the baffle between the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.790" end="00:43:21.610" style="s2">constructivists and the perennial list</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.350" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">but that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to advocate</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.610" end="00:43:26.590" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;re saying something</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:29.230" style="s2">similar Zac am i right yeah I mean and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.590" end="00:43:29.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s that focus on the theologies</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.230" end="00:43:31.720" style="s2">of practice</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.950" end="00:43:34.599" style="s2">allow for the self-transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.720" end="00:43:37.359" style="s2">allow for the personal synthesis like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.599" end="00:43:40.930" style="s2">that are you each end being able to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.359" end="00:43:42.760" style="s2">for yourself a set of propositions many</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.930" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">of which will be in overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.760" end="00:43:47.619" style="s2">consensus with the propositions of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:48.760" style="s2">others and pedagogically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.619" end="00:43:51.609" style="s2">interesting because you do end up</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.760" end="00:43:54.970" style="s2">needing simple lists of propositions to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.609" end="00:43:58.030" style="s2">tell kids and so when I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.970" end="00:43:59.650" style="s2">free play and I think of the way rituals</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.030" end="00:44:01.420" style="s2">spontaneously emerges actually think of</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.650" end="00:44:02.829" style="s2">P Piaget is the moral judgment of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.420" end="00:44:05.260" style="s2">child when the kids are playing marbles</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.829" end="00:44:06.310" style="s2">and so it is a completely free and it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.260" end="00:44:08.770" style="s2">actually talk about Jordan about this</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.310" end="00:44:10.420" style="s2">there&#39;s an employee up in space like</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.770" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">literally the kids have like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.420" end="00:44:12.910" style="s2">teachers are there but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:14.740" style="s2">teaching the kids how to play marbles</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.910" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">the kids literally create the game of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.740" end="00:44:20.260" style="s2">marbles and it&#39;s a very serious game in</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:23.050" style="s2">which there are right and wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.260" end="00:44:24.579" style="s2">morally good and bad and they have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.050" end="00:44:26.589" style="s2">young kids don&#39;t have rules but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.579" end="00:44:28.359" style="s2">older kids give the rules basically but</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.589" end="00:44:30.970" style="s2">the rules are flexible often they know</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.359" end="00:44:32.380" style="s2">that can change them at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.970" end="00:44:35.190" style="s2">when you ask a kid who invented the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.380" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">rules of marbles he says basically a god</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.190" end="00:44:40.900" style="s2">dad some of that but by the end by the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:42.040" style="s2">adolescence planning marbles when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.900" end="00:44:43.510" style="s2">my very high stakes because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.040" end="00:44:45.730" style="s2">taking the marbles home they should get</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.510" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">marbles to take away if you win you get</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.730" end="00:44:51.069" style="s2">a bunch of marbles they know that they</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:53.319" style="s2">created the rules and the play there is</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.069" end="00:44:55.960" style="s2">both physiological with the marble they</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.319" end="00:44:57.900" style="s2">would also die illogical we just say how</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.960" end="00:45:00.190" style="s2">do they without parental intervention</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.900" end="00:45:03.700" style="s2">without the teacher coming in how do</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.190" end="00:45:06.099" style="s2">they resolve a conflict either is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.700" end="00:45:08.050" style="s2">rule being applied or is the rule a</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.099" end="00:45:10.510" style="s2">problem and then how do you know if</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.050" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">rules a problem is it fair and then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.510" end="00:45:17.380" style="s2">go right up and into the rosianna</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:19.390" style="s2">Kohlberg in developmental sequence but</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.380" end="00:45:20.589" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s the there&#39;s the creation</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.390" end="00:45:22.630" style="s2">of the free play in these different</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.589" end="00:45:25.030" style="s2">realms and the free play in the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">the inter subjective and specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.030" end="00:45:29.619" style="s2">the realm of let&#39;s say fascicle is</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:31.660" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.619" end="00:45:34.839" style="s2">pedagogy and hard to create those</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.660" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">environments because and so this gets</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.839" end="00:45:38.410" style="s2">your point about we can&#39;t count if I a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:40.210" style="s2">list of rules that makes those</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.410" end="00:45:42.350" style="s2">environments disappear right we need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.210" end="00:45:45.830" style="s2">create environments precisely where</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.350" end="00:45:48.890" style="s2">young people and young adults and adults</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.830" end="00:45:53.030" style="s2">probably find a way to resolve their</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.890" end="00:45:55.220" style="s2">disputes through dialogue and through</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.030" end="00:45:57.530" style="s2">the creation of norms together as</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.220" end="00:45:59.660" style="s2">opposed to the procedural application of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.530" end="00:46:03.890" style="s2">a norm to a situation like legal for</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.660" end="00:46:05.810" style="s2">example or force and so yet with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.890" end="00:46:10.670" style="s2">disappearance of the playground and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.810" end="00:46:13.910" style="s2">retreat into the digital the total</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.670" end="00:46:15.650" style="s2">intermediation of that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.910" end="00:46:17.830" style="s2">they&#39;re developing a conflict in</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.650" end="00:46:21.230" style="s2">asynchronous text-based exchange is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.830" end="00:46:25.460" style="s2">given then doing so I mean in you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.230" end="00:46:26.870" style="s2">there&#39;s so-called real-world experiment</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.460" end="00:46:28.910" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.870" end="00:46:30.650" style="s2">that going to be exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.910" end="00:46:32.900" style="s2">disappearance of the playground can join</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.650" end="00:46:34.580" style="s2">to the virtual exodus we&#39;re running this</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.900" end="00:46:37.250" style="s2">huge social experiment that&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.580" end="00:46:40.040" style="s2">I think some pretty nasty consequences</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.250" end="00:46:42.350" style="s2">or that are kind of unforeseen by us</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.040" end="00:46:44.120" style="s2">right now I I think you mentioning that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.350" end="00:46:45.110" style="s2">zach is I just want to put a pin in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.120" end="00:46:47.570" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.110" end="00:46:49.700" style="s2">important that needs to be brought more</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.570" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">into the public discussion as something</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.700" end="00:46:56.270" style="s2">that we need to be thinking about more</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:59.630" style="s2">much more carefully can I ask you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.270" end="00:47:00.860" style="s2">another question then sure because you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.630" end="00:47:03.290" style="s2">said something more provocative and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.860" end="00:47:04.970" style="s2">gonna really I&#39;m gonna really commit to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.290" end="00:47:09.880" style="s2">trying to stay open and relaxed here I</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.970" end="00:47:13.070" style="s2">mean I I am a scientist by a profession</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.880" end="00:47:15.770" style="s2">and I also think by vocation I love</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.070" end="00:47:21.380" style="s2">doing science I don&#39;t just do it for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.770" end="00:47:25.210" style="s2">salary I do it because I believe in its</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.380" end="00:47:28.010" style="s2">capacity to make things better I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.210" end="00:47:29.690" style="s2">think I get what you say about scientism</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.010" end="00:47:33.290" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely not a positivist I do not</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.690" end="00:47:35.450" style="s2">think that meaning is based on our</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.290" end="00:47:37.910" style="s2">capacity for verification of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.450" end="00:47:39.100" style="s2">statements i I think positivism is a</p>

<p begin="00:47:39.100" end="00:47:43.460" style="s2">epistemological view so I completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.090" end="00:47:44.990" style="s2">reject that I think I know what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.460" end="00:47:47.420" style="s2">by scientism I think I&#39;ve said something</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.990" end="00:47:50.360" style="s2">similar along those lines and that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.420" end="00:47:52.670" style="s2">talk and Kris and I talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.360" end="00:47:53.900" style="s2">know propositional tyranny that we think</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.670" end="00:47:55.140" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried to reduce all forms of</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.140" end="00:47:58.619" style="s2">to inferential computational</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:48:01.049" style="s2">propositional knowing and a generation</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.619" end="00:48:03.710" style="s2">of theory and belief and that has cut us</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.049" end="00:48:06.890" style="s2">off from a procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.710" end="00:48:08.910" style="s2">respectable and participatory and those</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.890" end="00:48:11.160" style="s2">which are much more embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.910" end="00:48:14.190" style="s2">embedded in inactive kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.160" end="00:48:16.739" style="s2">are the main locus of where religio and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.190" end="00:48:19.499" style="s2">meaning is made and so that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.739" end="00:48:22.200" style="s2">propositional tyranny which I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.499" end="00:48:26.190" style="s2">to trace the history out I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.200" end="00:48:27.930" style="s2">significant cause of at least the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.190" end="00:48:30.480" style="s2">meaning crisis part of the four fold</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.930" end="00:48:34.470" style="s2">crisis so I&#39;m deeply critical of that so</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:36.480" style="s2">I guess I I guess I&#39;m also dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.470" end="00:48:39.869" style="s2">a bit of cognitive cognitive dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.480" end="00:48:42.150" style="s2">right now and myself I&#39;m trying to my my</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.869" end="00:48:45.299" style="s2">like I say my vocational allegiance to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.150" end="00:48:47.940" style="s2">science and my rejection of Puppets I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.299" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">sort of found a way I think of holding</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.940" end="00:48:53.099" style="s2">those two together consistently but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">want to know what you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.099" end="00:48:57.150" style="s2">and and then of course and you I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:48:59.609" style="s2">we should pursue this because I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.150" end="00:49:01.170" style="s2">this is directly relevant to how we see</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.609" end="00:49:03.569" style="s2">the Academy right now because I do agree</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.170" end="00:49:07.380" style="s2">with Zack that we&#39;ve tried to scientist</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.569" end="00:49:09.869" style="s2">the Academy in wait that&#39;s inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.380" end="00:49:12.630" style="s2">I was talking about this today that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.869" end="00:49:16.739" style="s2">know that this this fixation on stem is</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.630" end="00:49:18.900" style="s2">removing the training of imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.739" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">serious play and symbolic and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.900" end="00:49:22.980" style="s2">imaginal and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:25.170" style="s2">in all the process despite and which</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.980" end="00:49:26.940" style="s2">owes also with the disappearance of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.170" end="00:49:29.849" style="s2">playground i do i those are all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.940" end="00:49:32.970" style="s2">those go together which were the places</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.849" end="00:49:35.029" style="s2">where we really cultivated respect</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.970" end="00:49:39.989" style="s2">cobble and participatory transformation</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.029" end="00:49:41.880" style="s2">so what do you like to look yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.989" end="00:49:44.579" style="s2">which is sort of a blob of words but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.880" end="00:49:46.200" style="s2">just trying to sort of lay out at no for</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.579" end="00:49:47.579" style="s2">me this isn&#39;t obviously what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.200" end="00:49:49.650" style="s2">this is not just a theoretical issue</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.579" end="00:49:50.970" style="s2">this is an existential issue for me and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.650" end="00:49:52.890" style="s2">i have great respect for your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.970" end="00:49:55.710" style="s2">so i want to you know enter into some</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.890" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">dialogue here totally and I may have</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.710" end="00:49:58.829" style="s2">said a little estoppel but do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">remember I was saying we sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.829" end="00:50:03.029" style="s2">compare the worst of religion to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:04.499" style="s2">best of scientific discourse now saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.029" end="00:50:06.239" style="s2">we could compare the best of religious</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.499" end="00:50:07.710" style="s2">discourse to the worst a scientific this</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.239" end="00:50:10.349" style="s2">person I call the worst of science</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.710" end="00:50:13.140" style="s2">victus for scientism right as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.349" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">a religion capitalist right then I said</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.140" end="00:50:16.830" style="s2">something like military-industrial</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:18.780" style="s2">complex and a couple of things and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.830" end="00:50:21.330" style="s2">another way to talk about scientism is</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.780" end="00:50:25.080" style="s2">something like techno industrial</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.330" end="00:50:28.260" style="s2">scientific reductionism which is the key</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.080" end="00:50:29.820" style="s2">is because I I couldn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.260" end="00:50:32.310" style="s2">say I actually haven&#39;t spent enough time</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.820" end="00:50:34.859" style="s2">to hide it maybe but it&#39;s it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.310" end="00:50:37.800" style="s2">running at it&#39;s not an obsession with</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.859" end="00:50:40.230" style="s2">propositions that&#39;s true it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.800" end="00:50:44.390" style="s2">an obsession with applications</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.230" end="00:50:48.330" style="s2">specifically for renumeration and</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.390" end="00:50:50.700" style="s2">capital gain so after Beth&#39;s car wrote</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.330" end="00:50:53.190" style="s2">its philosophy of science he then went</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.700" end="00:50:56.190" style="s2">on to a dialectical period where he</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.190" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">cashed in the check that he had written</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.190" end="00:50:59.700" style="s2">to the positivist about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:01.470" style="s2">there was something and this that had to</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.700" end="00:51:04.770" style="s2">do with the nature of how the economic</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.470" end="00:51:06.450" style="s2">system was wrong sure so basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.770" end="00:51:07.920" style="s2">scientism the reason scientist some</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.450" end="00:51:11.880" style="s2">holds strong even though it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.920" end="00:51:14.460" style="s2">not great for us has to do with messed</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.880" end="00:51:16.320" style="s2">up incentive systems in the production</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.460" end="00:51:18.839" style="s2">of scientific knowledge so that in many</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.320" end="00:51:20.280" style="s2">cases it&#39;s not the unforced force of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.839" end="00:51:21.900" style="s2">better argument and it&#39;s not even the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.280" end="00:51:25.109" style="s2">thing that makes the most scientific</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.900" end="00:51:27.900" style="s2">sense and so that is one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.109" end="00:51:30.630" style="s2">vectors there that&#39;s had down downstream</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.900" end="00:51:33.480" style="s2">impact on I think leading us to these</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.630" end="00:51:36.270" style="s2">forms of propositional obsession and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.480" end="00:51:38.280" style="s2">kind of reductive way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.270" end="00:51:39.930" style="s2">right motive knowledge and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.280" end="00:51:42.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense there&#39;s no interior</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.930" end="00:51:44.670" style="s2">or dates and all that stuff but mostly</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.540" end="00:51:46.830" style="s2">the stuff that worries me has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.670" end="00:51:49.140" style="s2">the places where we can&#39;t even really do</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.830" end="00:51:52.080" style="s2">some I love science I also consider</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.140" end="00:51:54.839" style="s2">myself a scientist and I want to save</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.080" end="00:51:57.510" style="s2">science from scientism and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.839" end="00:51:59.869" style="s2">save specifically from the techno</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.510" end="00:52:03.150" style="s2">industrial opportunism and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.869" end="00:52:06.180" style="s2">instrumentalization of science which is</p>

<p begin="00:52:07.650" end="00:52:11.250" style="s2">autre genic plague that you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.690" end="00:52:12.780" style="s2">last time yeah I mean that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.250" end="00:52:14.369" style="s2">scary place where it happens but happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.780" end="00:52:17.190" style="s2">I I I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re referring</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.190" end="00:52:22.470" style="s2">has to do with injury caused</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.470" end="00:52:27.840" style="s2">insert the notion being that if we have</p>

<p begin="00:52:31.980" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">could say it doesn&#39;t run for profit well</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.450" end="00:52:37.320" style="s2">in America it does right and the</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.820" end="00:53:15.990" style="s2">in the social fabric that it becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.980" end="00:53:17.610" style="s2">hard to even talk about them but this</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.990" end="00:53:19.290" style="s2">happens in all fields right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.610" end="00:53:20.670" style="s2">there&#39;s scientific discussions that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.290" end="00:53:22.020" style="s2">had about fossil fuels which can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.670" end="00:53:24.900" style="s2">had their scientific discussions we had</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.020" end="00:53:27.420" style="s2">about solar panels and the fact that can</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.900" end="00:53:29.250" style="s2">we create net positive energy production</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.420" end="00:53:30.840" style="s2">from solar panels or not that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.250" end="00:53:32.070" style="s2">a scientific debate it&#39;s not clear you</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.840" end="00:53:34.650" style="s2">know if you put them in space we good</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.070" end="00:53:37.890" style="s2">for right now it costs more energy to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.650" end="00:53:39.660" style="s2">make them then they can pull so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.890" end="00:53:42.120" style="s2">scientific debate for example it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.660" end="00:53:45.270" style="s2">being had that needs to be had but</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.120" end="00:53:47.820" style="s2">because of certain motions in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.270" end="00:53:49.860" style="s2">culture and specifically in industry and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.820" end="00:53:53.550" style="s2">economic growth and incentives of those</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.860" end="00:53:55.850" style="s2">nature will you get scientism which is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.550" end="00:53:58.050" style="s2">set of propositions about what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.850" end="00:53:59.910" style="s2">that set of propositions about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.050" end="00:54:01.710" style="s2">true about the objective world or about</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.910" end="00:54:03.960" style="s2">your own body or about your own mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.710" end="00:54:05.670" style="s2">that proposition becomes the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.960" end="00:54:07.650" style="s2">regulates all these institutional</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.670" end="00:54:12.260" style="s2">domains and interactions and ritual</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.650" end="00:54:14.160" style="s2">spaces and question them it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.260" end="00:54:16.500" style="s2">alright how do you question it you</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:19.940" style="s2">actually have to become a expert PhD</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.500" end="00:54:23.600" style="s2">expert and so you&#39;re at the whim of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.940" end="00:54:26.490" style="s2">propositions wielded by sign to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.600" end="00:54:30.110" style="s2">future capture that&#39;s like the most</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.490" end="00:54:30.110" style="s2">negative way to paint scientism now</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.170" end="00:54:34.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was asking for</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.560" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s you&#39;re doing a great</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.780" end="00:54:42.550" style="s2">job so I actually know somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:45.190" style="s2">personally here in Canada who&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.550" end="00:54:46.870" style="s2">very hard to address the the plague you</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.190" end="00:54:49.270" style="s2">were talking about we&#39;re trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.870" end="00:54:52.120" style="s2">a lot of transparency into and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.270" end="00:54:54.280" style="s2">getting like legal success on this into</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.120" end="00:54:56.860" style="s2">the funding of pharmaceutical research</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.280" end="00:54:59.050" style="s2">medical research this is a big movement</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.860" end="00:55:02.470" style="s2">that&#39;s gaining steam largely due to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.050" end="00:55:04.110" style="s2">environment one individual and because</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.470" end="00:55:07.030" style="s2">we Canada has a different culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.110" end="00:55:10.420" style="s2">towards healthcare it gets more traction</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.030" end="00:55:12.600" style="s2">here so ideally appreciate what you said</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.420" end="00:55:16.120" style="s2">now that I understand the play you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.600" end="00:55:18.490" style="s2">referring to so I was talking with</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.120" end="00:55:21.280" style="s2">Johannes about you know the high</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.490" end="00:55:22.810" style="s2">daguerreian idea about science and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.280" end="00:55:26.560" style="s2">technology being and did some framing</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.810" end="00:55:30.310" style="s2">and a way in which it sort of traps us</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.560" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">into you know a cultural having mode we</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.310" end="00:55:36.130" style="s2">see we see the world as Heidegger&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.520" end="00:55:38.140" style="s2">as a standing reserve and it exists only</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.130" end="00:55:41.470" style="s2">in its service to service that it can</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.140" end="00:55:46.750" style="s2">provide to us and that we lack an</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.470" end="00:55:49.810" style="s2">ability to even ask how we might matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.750" end="00:55:55.740" style="s2">to it or how we might be in service to</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.810" end="00:55:59.380" style="s2">it or that it might how to what degrees</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.740" end="00:56:00.970" style="s2">it transcends our grasp of it and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.380" end="00:56:02.920" style="s2">we should therefore respect it precisely</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.970" end="00:56:06.460" style="s2">because of that this is or the high</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.920" end="00:56:08.710" style="s2">daguerreian critique and it meshes back</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.460" end="00:56:10.180" style="s2">with what we were talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.710" end="00:56:14.740" style="s2">because I think of Thomas björkman</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.180" end="00:56:19.090" style="s2">argument that as we&#39;ve lost as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.740" end="00:56:22.480" style="s2">lost sort of you know religion and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.090" end="00:56:24.610" style="s2">perhaps science at least in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:29.350" style="s2">way maybe you and I Thomas are all using</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.610" end="00:56:32.130" style="s2">attack we basically what&#39;s the market</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.350" end="00:56:36.840" style="s2">has been left as the default authority</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.130" end="00:56:41.740" style="s2">we don&#39;t have anything that represents</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.840" end="00:56:43.120" style="s2">values from the being mode we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.740" end="00:56:45.719" style="s2">anything that does that we don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.120" end="00:56:51.309" style="s2">institution</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.719" end="00:56:52.630" style="s2">and I&#39;m just wondering because you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.309" end="00:56:54.159" style="s2">we used to have we used to have three</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.630" end="00:56:56.319" style="s2">things that played off against we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.159" end="00:56:58.119" style="s2">to the market and we have the church and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.319" end="00:57:00.309" style="s2">we had the king right and you could</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.119" end="00:57:01.659" style="s2">always play them off against each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.309" end="00:57:04.179" style="s2">and so there was this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.659" end="00:57:07.479" style="s2">capacity for you know self correction</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.179" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">and self constraint and not just in</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.479" end="00:57:15.309" style="s2">action but also in theory and so what</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:16.599" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to put my finger on is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.309" end="00:57:20.169" style="s2">seems like we&#39;ve got this homogenization</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.599" end="00:57:22.509" style="s2">of power down to the market and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.169" end="00:57:23.919" style="s2">we&#39;ve got right hamato were like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.509" end="00:57:26.679" style="s2">getting into deep moral confusion the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.919" end="00:57:28.359" style="s2">only mode is the market mode following</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.679" end="00:57:30.699" style="s2">from which is you know the having mode</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.359" end="00:57:33.759" style="s2">and modal confusion and then this lines</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.699" end="00:57:35.859" style="s2">up with perhaps what I think I hear</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.759" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">you&#39;re saying we&#39;re where science is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.859" end="00:57:40.630" style="s2">understood or I would say misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:42.969" style="s2">as the halving of propositions and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.630" end="00:57:44.919" style="s2">all of those things would line up like</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.969" end="00:57:48.459" style="s2">they would mutually reinforce each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.919" end="00:57:50.049" style="s2">in a powerful way is that does that land</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.459" end="00:57:51.819" style="s2">with you does that does that sound like</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.049" end="00:57:52.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s connecting with what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.819" end="00:57:54.819" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.359" end="00:57:56.639" style="s2">yeah I mean very precisely and your</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.819" end="00:57:59.289" style="s2">canons point about the fact that all</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.639" end="00:58:00.909" style="s2">authority the so the crisis of authority</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.289" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">that we were talking about legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.909" end="00:58:03.519" style="s2">doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:05.559" style="s2">the result of that is that well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.519" end="00:58:08.139" style="s2">market now that&#39;s the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.559" end="00:58:10.389" style="s2">can serve and so that means that yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.139" end="00:58:13.149" style="s2">science you can apply the commodity form</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.389" end="00:58:15.130" style="s2">to science itself yeah did you put the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.149" end="00:58:17.349" style="s2">scientific finding on the shelf and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.130" end="00:58:18.669" style="s2">actually occlude everything that created</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.349" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">the scientific finding actually applied</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.669" end="00:58:23.139" style="s2">to the line so that it speaks to you as</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.559" end="00:58:25.119" style="s2">as a commodity almost like second nature</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.139" end="00:58:29.169" style="s2">and then you just accept took your head</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.119" end="00:58:30.969" style="s2">and so yeah it&#39;s and that&#39;s the weekend</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.169" end="00:58:33.219" style="s2">the worst scientific discourse right but</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.969" end="00:58:35.349" style="s2">there is science going on or poor we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.219" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">be dead back amazingly so somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.349" end="00:58:39.429" style="s2">there are institutional niches where</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:40.869" style="s2">there&#39;s been a preservation of the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.429" end="00:58:42.459" style="s2">of interpersonal relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.869" end="00:58:44.649" style="s2">personal practices that actually allow</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.459" end="00:58:46.119" style="s2">for science to exist and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.649" end="00:58:46.779" style="s2">everything to remember about science is</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.119" end="00:58:50.229" style="s2">that where I should talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.779" end="00:58:51.729" style="s2">scientists right here are people and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.229" end="00:58:54.819" style="s2">their capacities and their meaning</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.729" end="00:58:57.339" style="s2">making nation and all of that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.819" end="00:58:58.440" style="s2">where are they and how did they get</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.339" end="00:59:00.990" style="s2">trained and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.440" end="00:59:03.720" style="s2">and so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.990" end="00:59:05.280" style="s2">because as much as I am trying to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.720" end="00:59:07.740" style="s2">critical of stem and the over emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.280" end="00:59:10.470" style="s2">on stem but I&#39;m also like we really need</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.740" end="00:59:13.440" style="s2">actually better scientists and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.470" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">not that I want stem to be dialed back</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.440" end="00:59:17.339" style="s2">instead I want somehow there to be an</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:20.609" style="s2">understanding that you can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.339" end="00:59:23.400" style="s2">stem if you don&#39;t have the human figure</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.609" end="00:59:24.839" style="s2">now that the scientists won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.400" end="00:59:26.490" style="s2">work if I can&#39;t make meaning of their</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.839" end="00:59:29.339" style="s2">lives like this is just what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.490" end="00:59:31.470" style="s2">happen and if that&#39;s the case then we</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.339" end="00:59:33.150" style="s2">actually have to handle these other</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.470" end="00:59:34.980" style="s2">dimensions of education or to prepare</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.150" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">scientists actually be able to value</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.980" end="00:59:40.980" style="s2">truth for example as opposed to value</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:44.299" style="s2">renumeration which is the default value</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.980" end="00:59:48.630" style="s2">that decides what you should value</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.299" end="00:59:50.220" style="s2">exactly and so yet the call for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.630" end="00:59:52.530" style="s2">humanistic education is actually to save</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.220" end="00:59:55.829" style="s2">scientists and to save scientific</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.530" end="00:59:57.240" style="s2">civilization it&#39;s not to pull the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.829" end="00:59:59.190" style="s2">funding from science it&#39;s to say no</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.240" end="01:00:01.650" style="s2">actually look at this world we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.190" end="01:00:03.839" style="s2">created with your pure scientists who</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.650" end="01:00:05.849" style="s2">haven&#39;t been trained holistically as</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.839" end="01:00:07.279" style="s2">let&#39;s say Plato or Socrates would have</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.849" end="01:00:12.119" style="s2">demanded they would they were trained</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.279" end="01:00:14.130" style="s2">and so yeah that&#39;s interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.119" end="01:00:15.510" style="s2">confluences of where the conversations</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.130" end="01:00:17.160" style="s2">led and I think it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.510" end="01:00:20.730" style="s2">right because who&#39;s the wise scientist</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.160" end="01:00:22.650" style="s2">where&#39;s the wise well yeah I think we</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.730" end="01:00:24.630" style="s2">need why scientists I&#39;ve actually made</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.650" end="01:00:26.849" style="s2">that argument I just wondering then if</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.630" end="01:00:29.369" style="s2">because we&#39;ve now circled back again to</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.849" end="01:00:30.839" style="s2">our educational history because I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.369" end="01:00:33.059" style="s2">part of the problem has been at least</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.839" end="01:00:34.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve made this argument that provides</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.059" end="01:00:37.260" style="s2">historical reasons we separated two</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.980" end="01:00:39.119" style="s2">educational institutions I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.260" end="01:00:40.740" style="s2">fair to call them this given their the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.119" end="01:00:43.319" style="s2">broad notion of Education we both were</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.740" end="01:00:44.910" style="s2">all all three of us are using here but</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.319" end="01:00:47.250" style="s2">you know when we separated the monastery</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.910" end="01:00:51.329" style="s2">from the university in the Middle Ages I</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.250" end="01:00:54.569" style="s2">think that has had that has sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.329" end="01:00:56.490" style="s2">reverberate it and it it&#39;s let I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.569" end="01:00:58.140" style="s2">because then then the university touches</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.490" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">to the state and then the university</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.140" end="01:01:02.339" style="s2">then attaches via the deconstruction of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">the state to the market and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.339" end="01:01:08.569" style="s2">well I think in a very powerful way how</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:10.589" style="s2">we ended up where we are right now I</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.569" end="01:01:12.749" style="s2">mean that&#39;s incredible</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.589" end="01:01:14.819" style="s2">what you said to me because that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.749" end="01:01:16.170" style="s2">that&#39;s like the thread through and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.819" end="01:01:19.049" style="s2">has to do with what happened when the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.170" end="01:01:21.690" style="s2">Enlightenment got going right and the 30</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.049" end="01:01:24.779" style="s2">Years War and the fear of religion right</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.690" end="01:01:27.479" style="s2">and the needing for yep that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.779" end="01:01:28.829" style="s2">separate these things and eventually the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.479" end="01:01:30.599" style="s2">separation of church and state but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.829" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">you get the powers of truth and beauty</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.599" end="01:01:36.809" style="s2">and goodness if you if I can say that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:38.249" style="s2">attached to the state as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.809" end="01:01:40.729" style="s2">chance to the church so there was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.249" end="01:01:43.680" style="s2">deadly the University gotta hand it over</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.729" end="01:01:46.410" style="s2">to eventually the state apparatus and</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.680" end="01:01:48.450" style="s2">then eventually the market yeah and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.410" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">so yeah the question of how to pull the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.450" end="01:01:55.039" style="s2">Academy back into the sacred and make</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:57.450" style="s2">and the the places that make the person</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.039" end="01:01:58.890" style="s2">which are you know traditionally the</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.450" end="01:02:00.779" style="s2">religions whatever as we&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.890" end="01:02:02.190" style="s2">that needs to be rethought so now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.779" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">imagining academic knowledge production</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.190" end="01:02:07.859" style="s2">know what did with the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:10.200" style="s2">apologies have practice that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.859" end="01:02:12.599" style="s2">produces and look that way you just said</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.200" end="01:02:16.859" style="s2">that I like that idea about trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.599" end="01:02:19.229" style="s2">make the creation of a person within a</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.859" end="01:02:21.539" style="s2">community of persons the central task</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.229" end="01:02:23.249" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.539" end="01:02:25.739" style="s2">not we&#39;re not oriented that way right</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.249" end="01:02:28.950" style="s2">now I mean we&#39;re not oriented that way</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.739" end="01:02:33.089" style="s2">we wanted to towards you know making</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.950" end="01:02:35.880" style="s2">making consumer producers as effectively</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.089" end="01:02:37.319" style="s2">as we can but I think I just I what you</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.880" end="01:02:40.829" style="s2">just said there I think that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.319" end="01:02:43.619" style="s2">gem in the dialogue trying to make that</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.829" end="01:02:45.119" style="s2">you know that that that awesome and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.619" end="01:02:47.640" style="s2">mean that in the sense of filling us</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:50.460" style="s2">with all that awesome project that</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.640" end="01:02:53.339" style="s2">sacred project of making persons within</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.460" end="01:02:57.239" style="s2">a community of persons that the central</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.339" end="01:02:58.950" style="s2">thing we&#39;re trying to were we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.239" end="01:03:01.259" style="s2">to do I I think that that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.950" end="01:03:01.829" style="s2">a beautiful thing to have said yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.259" end="01:03:06.089" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.829" end="01:03:07.890" style="s2">I was as well also Bonita said the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.089" end="01:03:10.019" style="s2">thing when I talked to her it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.890" end="01:03:12.359" style="s2">redefinition of the human being or going</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.019" end="01:03:15.359" style="s2">back to another vision of the human</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.359" end="01:03:20.369" style="s2">being right as not being some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.359" end="01:03:23.640" style="s2">end product or or but a process and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.369" end="01:03:26.940" style="s2">that should be the the main thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.640" end="01:03:28.380" style="s2">yeah main main main point of Education</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.940" end="01:03:31.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just it seems like an almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.380" end="01:03:34.830" style="s2">uh overly obvious thing which every</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.770" end="01:03:36.930" style="s2">missing out completely right right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.830" end="01:03:38.580" style="s2">the way you articulated and the slope</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.930" end="01:03:41.790" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying Andrews correct and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.580" end="01:03:43.620" style="s2">it&#39;s because of what what John was</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.790" end="01:03:45.330" style="s2">saying about Heidegger&#39;s notion of</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.620" end="01:03:46.830" style="s2">technology right that we don&#39;t we asked</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.330" end="01:03:50.880" style="s2">what it can do for us basically we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.830" end="01:03:52.230" style="s2">ask but we do for it yeah even in school</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.880" end="01:03:53.550" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about it I&#39;m gonna go get</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.230" end="01:03:54.960" style="s2">this job so we can get that money and</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.550" end="01:03:56.070" style="s2">then do that thing right or whatever if</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.960" end="01:03:58.260" style="s2">you&#39;re they can conventionally or</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.070" end="01:03:59.790" style="s2">something but you&#39;re not thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.260" end="01:04:02.940" style="s2">we&#39;ll wait a second if I get that job</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.790" end="01:04:04.980" style="s2">how much of my labor time will actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.940" end="01:04:06.750" style="s2">contribute to the wages that go to that</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.980" end="01:04:08.220" style="s2">guy and if I buy this thing how much of</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.750" end="01:04:09.960" style="s2">that goes to so you&#39;re not thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.220" end="01:04:11.880" style="s2">about how you were actually needed by</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.960" end="01:04:13.320" style="s2">the system you&#39;re um and so if you flip</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.880" end="01:04:15.780" style="s2">the script and you realize now that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.320" end="01:04:18.870" style="s2">school is actually making me so I can be</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.780" end="01:04:20.460" style="s2">useful to that as it goes through a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.870" end="01:04:21.900" style="s2">all right so then if you flip it as we</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.460" end="01:04:22.980" style="s2">discussed and you and put the tempo of</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.900" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">learning at the top of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.980" end="01:04:28.500" style="s2">economic stack and then you end up</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.960" end="01:04:30.230" style="s2">saying oh no what it wants from what it</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.500" end="01:04:32.370" style="s2">wants for me but the whole technological</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.230" end="01:04:34.680" style="s2">civilization alabbar at us once for me</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.370" end="01:04:37.950" style="s2">is for me to be me there me to develop</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.680" end="01:04:41.250" style="s2">that seems to be a deep complexification</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.950" end="01:04:44.460" style="s2">of everything because one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.250" end="01:04:46.350" style="s2">why we&#39;re in this state when I think of</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.460" end="01:04:49.290" style="s2">my students is is weird entirely</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.350" end="01:04:52.860" style="s2">confused about that question about what</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.290" end="01:04:54.780" style="s2">it means to be to be human is that it</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.860" end="01:04:58.380" style="s2">make it I don&#39;t know we should ask that</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.780" end="01:05:00.810" style="s2">question Oh Andrew I think the question</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.380" end="01:05:03.540" style="s2">we had before is a is is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.810" end="01:05:05.160" style="s2">more precise question which is what does</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.540" end="01:05:07.080" style="s2">it mean to be a person in a community of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.160" end="01:05:08.430" style="s2">persons because I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.080" end="01:05:11.010" style="s2">we&#39;re what we&#39;re pointing to with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.430" end="01:05:13.020" style="s2">word human the problem I have with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.010" end="01:05:14.550" style="s2">word human is its nebulous and it shows</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.020" end="01:05:15.810" style="s2">up in multiple domains you can get into</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.550" end="01:05:18.720" style="s2">all kinds of equivocations</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.810" end="01:05:23.520" style="s2">but when we&#39;re working right whereas I</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.720" end="01:05:26.790" style="s2">think this notion of person making and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.520" end="01:05:28.380" style="s2">and and and I keep I keep healing</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.790" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">Tillich in my mind you never have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.380" end="01:05:31.050" style="s2">person without a community of persons</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:33.660" style="s2">around it and that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.050" end="01:05:36.320" style="s2">developmental truth right persons not</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.660" end="01:05:38.820" style="s2">made in an individualistic fashion</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.320" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">they&#39;re made in a communitarian fashion</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.820" end="01:05:44.670" style="s2">always I hope you don&#39;t feel like no no</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:47.520" style="s2">worry no no worries I just I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.670" end="01:05:49.800" style="s2">maybe a human is something that&#39;s we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.520" end="01:05:51.870" style="s2">all human but a person is something that</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.800" end="01:05:53.340" style="s2">we become well that&#39;s but that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.870" end="01:05:56.160" style="s2">want that&#39;s what I want ever you want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.340" end="01:05:58.980" style="s2">say right yeah I want to emphasize your</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.160" end="01:06:01.320" style="s2">humanity is something you have but I</p>

<p begin="01:06:01.320" end="01:06:04.940" style="s2">were talking about I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.790" end="01:06:08.490" style="s2">this you know that to which you aspire</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.940" end="01:06:10.590" style="s2">right right which is the being mode</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.490" end="01:06:12.480" style="s2">there&#39;s an element of transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.590" end="01:06:14.700" style="s2">there yes yes exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.480" end="01:06:19.950" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying and if for it carries</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.700" end="01:06:24.570" style="s2">with it it carries with it it carries</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.950" end="01:06:25.940" style="s2">with it the deep connections to well as</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.570" end="01:06:29.280" style="s2">we said the deep connections to</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.940" end="01:06:32.010" style="s2">education and to a sense of reverence</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.280" end="01:06:37.050" style="s2">for something that is possess the</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.010" end="01:06:39.960" style="s2">sacredness for us don&#39;t actually like</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.050" end="01:06:41.370" style="s2">the reframing of the question from what</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.960" end="01:06:43.020" style="s2">is a human to the question of what is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.370" end="01:06:44.730" style="s2">person or what does it mean to be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.020" end="01:06:45.930" style="s2">person in a community of persons and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.730" end="01:06:47.190" style="s2">question what is a human is one that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.930" end="01:06:51.300" style="s2">asked a lot and I realize I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.190" end="01:06:53.820" style="s2">asking that question that the human is</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.300" end="01:06:57.420" style="s2">perhaps the only thing we know that can</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.820" end="01:06:58.920" style="s2">become a person right and different from</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.420" end="01:07:01.890" style="s2">being sentient different from being</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.920" end="01:07:05.190" style="s2">intelligent as being a person and this</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.890" end="01:07:07.590" style="s2">is part of the AI problem is about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.190" end="01:07:11.010" style="s2">making of a person and the being of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.590" end="01:07:12.330" style="s2">person is it&#39;s actually interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.010" end="01:07:13.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s part again that talked</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.330" end="01:07:15.870" style="s2">about the best of worth of justice for</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.650" end="01:07:18.600" style="s2">us right we&#39;re very very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.870" end="01:07:21.090" style="s2">stuff about the nature of personhood in</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.600" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">the theistic tradition it&#39;s like it was</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.090" end="01:07:25.260" style="s2">to get Corbin&#39;s work on the book</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:27.480" style="s2">angelology and the notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.260" end="01:07:30.150" style="s2">imaginal and that it&#39;s populated with</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.480" end="01:07:32.070" style="s2">the person&#39;s then you get all of these</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.150" end="01:07:34.440" style="s2">possible transcendental operators that</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.070" end="01:07:38.040" style="s2">can we do through the imagine but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.440" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">with the cosmic person not human which</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.040" end="01:07:43.800" style="s2">is very interesting so thing is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:46.770" style="s2">human also something to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.800" end="01:07:48.060" style="s2">transcend it in a way or am I going too</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.770" end="01:07:50.070" style="s2">far here that&#39;s the thing like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.060" end="01:07:53.370" style="s2">from zero like if there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.070" end="01:07:55.230" style="s2">human nature you know like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.370" end="01:07:56.940" style="s2">question of limitation right but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.230" end="01:08:00.890" style="s2">person is kind of playing an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.940" end="01:08:03.210" style="s2">game if I can say that my cursor and</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.890" end="01:08:06.630" style="s2">because you&#39;re lifted up into this realm</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.210" end="01:08:09.180" style="s2">of person making which is something like</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.630" end="01:08:11.160" style="s2">this communicative realm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.180" end="01:08:14.790" style="s2">linguistically mediated it&#39;s imaginal</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.160" end="01:08:16.500" style="s2">and and so again now we&#39;re back to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.790" end="01:08:18.450" style="s2">Hebrew tradition but that notion that</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.500" end="01:08:21.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve each got a letter in the Torah</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.450" end="01:08:24.750" style="s2">right that sense that the person lifts</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.750" end="01:08:29.400" style="s2">the human into something deeper than</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.750" end="01:08:34.980" style="s2">just material reality and yeah the the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.400" end="01:08:36.930" style="s2">new etic and the imaginal basically are</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.980" end="01:08:40.170" style="s2">the qualities of the person you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.930" end="01:08:42.990" style="s2">find in material or the animal arguably</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.170" end="01:08:45.690" style="s2">now animals have personality personality</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.990" end="01:08:49.290" style="s2">is different from personhood vegans</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.690" end="01:08:52.859" style="s2">that&#39;s you right we sort of misused</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.290" end="01:08:54.210" style="s2">ended up misusing that term and in</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.859" end="01:08:56.700" style="s2">psychology and when we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.210" end="01:08:58.500" style="s2">personality theory because that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.700" end="01:09:00.450" style="s2">we we need to talk about sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.500" end="01:09:02.790" style="s2">dispositional traits I get that but we</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.450" end="01:09:04.290" style="s2">when when we when we started using the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.790" end="01:09:06.359" style="s2">word personality for that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.290" end="01:09:08.180" style="s2">replace it with personhood as another</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.359" end="01:09:11.580" style="s2">phenomena that needed to be talked about</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.180" end="01:09:13.589" style="s2">and so we got a neglect because of an</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.580" end="01:09:15.660" style="s2">impoverishment of our conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.589" end="01:09:22.200" style="s2">repertoire that I think has been sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.660" end="01:09:24.660" style="s2">disastrous for us so this did I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.200" end="01:09:26.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you guys know but I got to</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.660" end="01:09:28.710" style="s2">talk directly to Tom at Thomas Cheetham</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.640" end="01:09:32.390" style="s2">about Korbin and all the work he&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.710" end="01:09:36.390" style="s2">on it we&#39;re gonna talk again about it</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.390" end="01:09:44.400" style="s2">and about Korbin so this this brings me</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.390" end="01:09:46.230" style="s2">again to something about maybe I want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:49.260" style="s2">move questions about a reformulation of</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.230" end="01:09:51.690" style="s2">the notion of person in some way I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.260" end="01:09:55.860" style="s2">think I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a degradation</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.690" end="01:09:58.950" style="s2">of concept so Zach you talked about you</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.860" end="01:10:00.330" style="s2">know carbons you know in geology and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.950" end="01:10:03.060" style="s2">know I talked about the sacred second</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.330" end="01:10:04.020" style="s2">self staying talks about the divine</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.060" end="01:10:06.720" style="s2">double and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.020" end="01:10:09.780" style="s2">talks about us not being individuals but</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.720" end="01:10:12.210" style="s2">being dividuals that we&#39;re there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.780" end="01:10:14.250" style="s2">all it&#39;s like Apple Annie&#39;s idea that</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.210" end="01:10:17.190" style="s2">attention is always a from - it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.250" end="01:10:21.030" style="s2">just a single thing we are always from -</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.190" end="01:10:24.750" style="s2">we&#39;re from this self right to the sacred</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.030" end="01:10:26.370" style="s2">second self right and so and we and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.750" end="01:10:28.170" style="s2">Angliss Keller talks about that and</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.370" end="01:10:30.420" style="s2">about how you have that weird structure</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.170" end="01:10:31.800" style="s2">and aspiration that I&#39;m the cause of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.420" end="01:10:35.940" style="s2">future self but it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.800" end="01:10:42.200" style="s2">normative authority over me and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.940" end="01:10:44.700" style="s2">gonna really wrestle with that we can we</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.200" end="01:10:49.470" style="s2">this is a difficult question and because</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.700" end="01:10:51.270" style="s2">we have a long heritage of the self</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.470" end="01:10:53.850" style="s2">being just the secular version of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.270" end="01:10:55.560" style="s2">soul and then again you guys both know</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.850" end="01:10:57.000" style="s2">I&#39;m deeply respectful to the mystic</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.560" end="01:10:58.920" style="s2">religion so I&#39;m not I&#39;m not trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.000" end="01:11:01.710" style="s2">insulting here but there was the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.920" end="01:11:03.900" style="s2">something encased or at least it&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.710" end="01:11:05.340" style="s2">to be understood that popular cultural I</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.900" end="01:11:07.470" style="s2">think that&#39;s fair for me to say that</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.340" end="01:11:10.410" style="s2">it&#39;s something that&#39;s you know encased</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.470" end="01:11:12.600" style="s2">inside of me in my head right and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.410" end="01:11:14.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what my self is and</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.600" end="01:11:18.330" style="s2">then I understand personhood in a</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.880" end="01:11:20.400" style="s2">completely interior way and it</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.330" end="01:11:23.940" style="s2">completely almost like you know brain</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.400" end="01:11:25.950" style="s2">centric way such you know well you could</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.940" end="01:11:29.910" style="s2">like the matrix you could so much just</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.950" end="01:11:32.580" style="s2">download me somewhere else right and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.910" end="01:11:34.680" style="s2">know you know the the kind of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.580" end="01:11:36.240" style="s2">science I practiced sort of calls all of</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.680" end="01:11:39.960" style="s2">those assumptions deeply into question</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.240" end="01:11:42.360" style="s2">and says no no you are you you know your</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.960" end="01:11:44.790" style="s2">body isn&#39;t clay your your cognition is</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.360" end="01:11:47.130" style="s2">constituted by you being embodied you</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.790" end="01:11:49.980" style="s2">being embedded you being like I say</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.130" end="01:11:53.100" style="s2">enacted and now you know I even want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.980" end="01:11:55.350" style="s2">add this extra component that your your</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.100" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">personhood is constituted aspirationally</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.350" end="01:12:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s right and so you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:04.530" style="s2">much more you&#39;re much more distributed</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:06.480" style="s2">then you are sort of isolated and</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.530" end="01:12:09.900" style="s2">compressed and locked in sort of a brain</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.480" end="01:12:12.059" style="s2">centric notion of what a person is did</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.900" end="01:12:14.760" style="s2">that make any sense it was that</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.059" end="01:12:18.210" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s beautiful I mean I have I</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.760" end="01:12:19.559" style="s2">completely agree and there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.210" end="01:12:21.239" style="s2">things the same in that notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.559" end="01:12:23.730" style="s2">divine double is just beautiful yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.239" end="01:12:26.579" style="s2">just love this notion end there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.730" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">many ways to I think work with it in one</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.579" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">of the ways I think about sometimes is</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:32.610" style="s2">with regard to like someone like Hillman</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:33.719" style="s2">it&#39;s only actually probably many right</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.610" end="01:12:36.030" style="s2">that you&#39;re you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.719" end="01:12:37.320" style="s2">monotheistic about your divine yep</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.030" end="01:12:40.920" style="s2">double but actually they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.320" end="01:12:43.079" style="s2">instead of trajectories that you&#39;re my</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.920" end="01:12:45.360" style="s2">divine double as a museum as a musician</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.079" end="01:12:46.770" style="s2">like the pan architect on okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.360" end="01:12:49.889" style="s2">completely different from my divine</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.770" end="01:12:53.010" style="s2">double as a scholar Metatron or</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.889" end="01:12:55.980" style="s2">something and say I mean they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.010" end="01:12:58.440" style="s2">former community yeah for Helen what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.980" end="01:13:01.980" style="s2">evolving and in a sense what presents as</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.440" end="01:13:03.770" style="s2">the personnel is is a conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.980" end="01:13:06.929" style="s2">the self is actually a core conversation</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.770" end="01:13:08.789" style="s2">between the many divine doubles that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.929" end="01:13:11.639" style="s2">have so the self is inherently</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.789" end="01:13:14.610" style="s2">biological to inherently dialogical</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.639" end="01:13:17.340" style="s2">precisely and potentially the self is</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.610" end="01:13:18.630" style="s2">witness to a divine dialogue between the</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.340" end="01:13:24.239" style="s2">arc types that are basically living</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.630" end="01:13:26.429" style="s2">within it oh oh oh that&#39;s tasty so this</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:28.170" style="s2">goes back to you know sort of well you</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.429" end="01:13:30.199" style="s2">know the antilog lived in the Augustine</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.170" end="01:13:32.579" style="s2">framework of the you know the the psyche</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.199" end="01:13:34.559" style="s2">instantiates some of the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.579" end="01:13:37.829" style="s2">form of the Trinity but what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.559" end="01:13:39.360" style="s2">saying is like the dialogic itself you</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.829" end="01:13:41.880" style="s2">know has participatory knowing it</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.360" end="01:13:47.250" style="s2">actually instantiates right the features</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.880" end="01:13:50.429" style="s2">of the dialogue in is by through action</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.250" end="01:13:53.059" style="s2">which is not just your head the whole</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.429" end="01:13:57.000" style="s2">the whole body the whole body becomes</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.059" end="01:13:58.469" style="s2">basically like a it&#39;s what I forget may</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.000" end="01:14:03.920" style="s2">have been korban according someone said</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.469" end="01:14:06.539" style="s2">it was the imaginal ship of death and</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:09.599" style="s2">it&#39;s and so that that sense that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.539" end="01:14:11.639" style="s2">have and so in this there&#39;s a movement</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.599" end="01:14:14.369" style="s2">tradition actually the Rasta who told me</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.639" end="01:14:17.250" style="s2">that quote practices spatial dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.369" end="01:14:19.980" style="s2">his name is hunter Turin he with spatial</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.250" end="01:14:21.679" style="s2">dynamics is a movement based practiced</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.980" end="01:14:23.060" style="s2">in the Rudolf Steiner tradition</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.679" end="01:14:25.909" style="s2">essentially if you&#39;ve gone to a Waldorf</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.060" end="01:14:28.010" style="s2">School and done games and your games</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.909" end="01:14:30.500" style="s2">teacher Walter School likely trained in</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.010" end="01:14:35.210" style="s2">spatial dynamics possibly was unturned</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.500" end="01:14:36.320" style="s2">and the whole movement the most one of</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.210" end="01:14:38.179" style="s2">the most incredible things ever said was</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.320" end="01:14:40.580" style="s2">that every gesture begins in the future</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.179" end="01:14:42.530" style="s2">yes that there&#39;s actually but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.580" end="01:14:44.420" style="s2">any imagination when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.530" end="01:14:46.310" style="s2">movement practice of any kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.420" end="01:14:48.290" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a you create an</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.310" end="01:14:51.260" style="s2">imaginal shell around the body and</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.290" end="01:14:52.670" style="s2">actually move into the psyche of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.260" end="01:14:54.739" style="s2">imagination yeah it&#39;s very it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.670" end="01:14:57.530" style="s2">much like he works with Tai Chi guys a</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.739" end="01:14:59.150" style="s2">lot and so yeah so there&#39;s that notion</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.530" end="01:15:00.679" style="s2">that yeah actually when you&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.150" end="01:15:03.320" style="s2">the divine double correctly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.679" end="01:15:05.150" style="s2">holding the full image of the body and</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.320" end="01:15:07.449" style="s2">in a sense it&#39;s the way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.150" end="01:15:11.810" style="s2">about the resurrection of the whole body</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.449" end="01:15:13.940" style="s2">or even define the actual matter of your</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.810" end="01:15:16.610" style="s2">body through exercise of an imagination</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.940" end="01:15:18.530" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not material it</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.610" end="01:15:20.750" style="s2">just means that you&#39;re in this imaginal</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.530" end="01:15:29.870" style="s2">ship of death instead of being in some</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.750" end="01:15:34.850" style="s2">bag of skin it&#39;s also that how&#39;s it good</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.870" end="01:15:37.100" style="s2">I&#39;m glad we got up and into that what</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.850" end="01:15:39.620" style="s2">the logos project that I&#39;m engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.100" end="01:15:42.850" style="s2">right now right because I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.620" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">get what&#39;s going on India logos and</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.850" end="01:15:47.300" style="s2">dialectic as you know an ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.679" end="01:15:49.340" style="s2">practices for trying to afford dialogo</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.300" end="01:15:50.060" style="s2">so know how it&#39;s something much more</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.340" end="01:15:52.940" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.060" end="01:15:56.540" style="s2">dialogue as we where we use that as a</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.940" end="01:15:59.060" style="s2">synonym now for discourse and you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.540" end="01:16:00.739" style="s2">so this kind of stuff we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.060" end="01:16:02.330" style="s2">about here is exactly you know and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.739" end="01:16:06.020" style="s2">see aspects of this in the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.330" end="01:16:07.909" style="s2">tradition around dialectic I&#39;m so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.020" end="01:16:09.170" style="s2">just I&#39;m just saying I&#39;m just think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.909" end="01:16:10.550" style="s2">sorry I don&#39;t want to waste everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.170" end="01:16:12.770" style="s2">time I&#39;m just explaining why I find it</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.550" end="01:16:14.330" style="s2">very helpful and I know and it is I mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.770" end="01:16:17.090" style="s2">I found it I found reading Hillman and</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.330" end="01:16:20.900" style="s2">Corbin and looking into these ways of</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.090" end="01:16:22.969" style="s2">thinking about the imaginal realm within</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.900" end="01:16:24.800" style="s2">basically has extremely therapeutically</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.969" end="01:16:25.390" style="s2">because once you understand the divine</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.800" end="01:16:27.460" style="s2">Devils</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.390" end="01:16:29.860" style="s2">one then you get that there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.460" end="01:16:31.780" style="s2">be internal tension between your divine</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.860" end="01:16:33.610" style="s2">elements basically that even the best</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.780" end="01:16:35.080" style="s2">parts of you could be in conflict for</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.610" end="01:16:37.630" style="s2">time and attention let&#39;s say in your</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.080" end="01:16:39.880" style="s2">life and that&#39;s going to cause emotional</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.630" end="01:16:41.380" style="s2">tension and so then you can actually set</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.880" end="01:16:43.180" style="s2">up internally and sometimes you can put</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.380" end="01:16:46.630" style="s2">it out in front of your constellations</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.180" end="01:16:48.340" style="s2">which I&#39;ve seen done we create you</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.630" end="01:16:50.230" style="s2">actually create a dialogue in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.340" end="01:16:54.210" style="s2">constructive imagination between your</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.230" end="01:16:57.100" style="s2">two divine but that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.210" end="01:16:59.020" style="s2">addition to this dialogue Louis idea too</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.100" end="01:17:00.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t it that you&#39;re not just dialoguing</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.020" end="01:17:01.660" style="s2">with another person you&#39;re dialoguing</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.640" end="01:17:04.150" style="s2">with all your different sub</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.660" end="01:17:06.430" style="s2">personalities and that was always here</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.150" end="01:17:08.860" style="s2">that was always there yeah I just</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.430" end="01:17:10.510" style="s2">hearing it for the first time popular</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.860" end="01:17:14.290" style="s2">republic write it all through the</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.510" end="01:17:16.900" style="s2">Republic and young young also has it to</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.290" end="01:17:19.990" style="s2">some degree too but what I what what</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.900" end="01:17:24.640" style="s2">came out for that for me was what the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.990" end="01:17:29.170" style="s2">this move of of taking that sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.640" end="01:17:31.840" style="s2">sort of the intrapsychic you know you</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.170" end="01:17:34.090" style="s2">know dialogue and also putting it out</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.840" end="01:17:36.460" style="s2">into the aspirational dialogue and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.090" end="01:17:37.810" style="s2">so there&#39;s sort of this dialogue and</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.460" end="01:17:39.340" style="s2">then there&#39;s a dialogue out and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.810" end="01:17:41.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a dialogue between all of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.340" end="01:17:42.220" style="s2">angels right if you get all out with</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.650" end="01:17:43.810" style="s2">that symbol</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.220" end="01:17:45.940" style="s2">so there&#39;s actually sort of three</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.810" end="01:17:47.920" style="s2">dialogues that need to be brought into</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.940" end="01:17:49.660" style="s2">consonant together that&#39;s what&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.920" end="01:17:53.110" style="s2">lighting up in my mind right now Andrew</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.660" end="01:17:54.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m sort of like aha yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.110" end="01:17:55.800" style="s2">and I&#39;ve never seen all three of those</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.340" end="01:17:57.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen a couple of them in isolation</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.800" end="01:17:59.860" style="s2">tonight when I think of the divine</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.850" end="01:18:02.830" style="s2">double I think of this one thing I that</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.860" end="01:18:06.010" style="s2">so I&#39;m very not what&#39;s lighting up in me</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.830" end="01:18:08.200" style="s2">is is is is it just makes total sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.010" end="01:18:13.450" style="s2">then it&#39;s the pagan Gloria it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.200" end="01:18:15.730" style="s2">pagan glory of polytheism right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.450" end="01:18:19.240" style="s2">also the HOS the Elohim a right right</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.730" end="01:18:22.540" style="s2">right yeah beautiful it is the other you</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.240" end="01:18:24.100" style="s2">know and yeah and that yeah so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.540" end="01:18:26.410" style="s2">that there&#39;s the refinement of that</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.100" end="01:18:29.290" style="s2">conversation within which helps to get</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.410" end="01:18:30.730" style="s2">the actions basically correct and Hannah</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.290" end="01:18:32.770" style="s2">dog it becomes this much more</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.730" end="01:18:34.570" style="s2">multi-dimensional process that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.770" end="01:18:37.110" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking which is a really really</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.570" end="01:18:37.110" style="s2">interesting</p>
