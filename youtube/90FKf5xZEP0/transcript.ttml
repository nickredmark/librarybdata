<p begin="00:00:01.920" end="00:00:04.720" style="s2">welcome to the solution racing we just</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.600" end="00:00:06.399" style="s2">decided before</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.720" end="00:00:07.839" style="s2">starting recording that we are doing it</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.399" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">on food security</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.839" end="00:00:11.920" style="s2">as eric would you like to start since</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:13.599" style="s2">you uh suggested the topic and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.920" end="00:00:15.280" style="s2">my guess is you know a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.599" end="00:00:15.679" style="s2">this these two billion people that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.280" end="00:00:18.560" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.679" end="00:00:19.840" style="s2">not be food secure well i don&#39;t i i only</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.560" end="00:00:21.680" style="s2">know it as a number i mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.840" end="00:00:24.160" style="s2">it was a thing i read i mean i would</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.680" end="00:00:27.199" style="s2">imagine you&#39;ve both heard about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.160" end="00:00:29.679" style="s2">pesticide failure to deliver pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.199" end="00:00:32.480" style="s2">back in january which led to which has</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.679" end="00:00:33.520" style="s2">led to the locust plague in uh asia and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">africa right and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.520" end="00:00:38.239" style="s2">it is for this reason among others that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">as many as two billion people will not</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.239" end="00:00:41.120" style="s2">be producing enough food for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:43.520" style="s2">this year and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.120" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">yeah i mean the consequences of that god</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.520" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">knows i mean that&#39;s a mess the likes of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">which we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:52.160" style="s2">never seen before right um</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:54.160" style="s2">so yeah god bless kobe god bless kobet</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.160" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">and our excessive ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.160" end="00:01:01.359" style="s2">response to it god bless you all</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:02.800" style="s2">all right i can definitely share even</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.359" end="00:01:04.000" style="s2">though i actually didn&#39;t know about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.800" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">i knew about the locust but i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.000" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">know it was because pesticides weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">for all i know we could have kept</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">putting pesticides on and their cell</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">would be locus because of how pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">and pests</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">work but um yes when kobit first</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:17.920" style="s2">happened my first thought was for our</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:19.759" style="s2">food security i&#39;m like i&#39;m gonna grow my</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.920" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">own garden not of course realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">i&#39;m never gonna have food insecurity</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">there&#39;s always gonna yes my</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">my brand might not be available i went</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:27.759" style="s2">and tried to buy annie&#39;s mac and cheese</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s what my kid will eat</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.759" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s way better than the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">alternatives it&#39;s like that&#39;s my food</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:33.920" style="s2">insecurity right like annie&#39;s mac and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:36.560" style="s2">cheese isn&#39;t available so i have to buy</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.920" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">the generic stuff or craft dinner</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.560" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">and the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">that we demote agricultural workers</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">to the base of society and are like we</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">don&#39;t even pay the minimum wage in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">canada we bring them</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">in from generally mexico and they get</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">our benefits like our medical benefits</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">and such and even ei</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">but they don&#39;t get a minimum wage and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">then they&#39;re hosed but we didn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">this year because of covid</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">and so even in the west where</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:09.039" style="s2">we have our own food right we&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">it here</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.039" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">we&#39;re not it&#39;s rotting it&#39;s rotting in</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">the fields because there aren&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">agricultural workers and then people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">are working in rice fields working be</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">doing assistance farming but on them not</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">i guess not assistance for me but more</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">wide scale are like stop and go home so</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like the places that are developing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">like they&#39;re gonna end up selling their</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">food to us it&#39;s gonna be quinoa it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:30.400" style="s2">gonna be like we get our food because we</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">can pay higher prices</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:33.519" style="s2">but unless you have an actual garden</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">that you can eat out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna be able to get food in</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">your marketplace and so i could see</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">that billions of people were about to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">starve and i grew my own little garden</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">thinking that you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a roaming anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know something and at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">there&#39;s some calories added to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">but yeah this is a massive</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">issue we need to eat and yet the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">the positive side of what&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">happening in my own life not in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">is like i just made zucchini pasta the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">other night from a zucchini that i grew</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">and i&#39;m not really a big gardener</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">but like the weird</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">like gardening is so beautiful you grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">seeds come out so you can like i grew</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">you know what i mean i had baby zucchini</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">plants that i bought as babies</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">and then now i have unlimited seeds or i</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">can just take the seeds out and plant</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">them next year theoretically we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">if it works unless they&#39;re terminator</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">seeds</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">that like one zucchini gives me enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">seeds to grow enough zucchinis for my</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">entire block which would give us enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">seeds to grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">you know for the entire city and yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">because we kind of have demoted</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">growing our own food to the base level</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s beneath me i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">buy it in the supermarket</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">but you don&#39;t have food security unless</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">you can grow your own food and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">all over the world people can&#39;t grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">their own food because of pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">because of herbicides because of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">there isn&#39;t enough fertilizer and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough land they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">access to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">yeah this is a huge problem so thanks</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">for suggesting it i hope we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">matt would you like to share for this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">portion of what it currently looks like</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">yeah sure um i think you brought up a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">couple of interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">um about you know i heard back when kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">of covid first</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">struck all of these uh dairy farms and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">um you know cow processing meat</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">processing plants they had to just like</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">throw away all of this perfectly good</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">milk and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">slaughter all of these innocent animals</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">why because supply chain issues or</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">just like like the problem wasn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t have enough food</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">it was just like the system that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">built up around the supply chains and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">and the workers and all of that broke</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">and so and then you know compounding</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">that with</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you guys went through</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">the whole uh toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">epidemic um earlier in the year but</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">that that was a little scary not just</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">because of toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">but because it showed i think the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">fragility</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">in the existing system meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">that you could go to a store and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">there could be enough toilet paper for</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">everybody but just because of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">you know hoarding and greed and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">supply chain shocks you know it would</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">just be</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">completely sold out um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing that all across the board</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">i mean like you go into</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">uh supplement stores or health food</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">stores and you try to go buy</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">zinc or vitamin d3 and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">those are just wiped off the shelves</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">because people are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">get the message that nutrition and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:52.639" style="s2">supplementation is important</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">so yeah i think um</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.639" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very fragile and then i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.120" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">one i&#39;m trying to pull this this uh data</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:04.479" style="s2">up here um this is kind of related to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.479" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">but i think what it what it shows is um</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">the kind of overall uh economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">conditions of at least americans</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">right now and it says uh roughly</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">10 to 14 million u.s renter households</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">that&#39;s around 24 million people were</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">behind on their rent</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">in september that amounts to 12 to 17</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">billion dollars in unpaid rent that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:41.199" style="s2">figure is expected to rise to 34 billion</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">in past due rent by january lifting the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.199" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">moratorium on evictions and foreclosures</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">will mean that millions of families will</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">be tossed out on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">so i would imagine if you can&#39;t pay your</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">rent</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">buying food is also going to be a factor</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">in in your in your life so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">is a kind of a compounding factor as</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">so yeah i&#39;ll shut up now now we can open</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">up the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">just going just going back to the um</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">fragility of supply chains thing i mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">it is it&#39;s this whole just-in-time thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">right in the name of efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">they deliver just what they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">need for the next 24 hours until the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">next delivery truck arrives yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">and one interruption anywhere in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">multi-linked chain</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">and and the whole thing collapses and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">going back to what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">jubilee about the only way</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">to have food security is to grow your</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">own food i mean i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">some truth to that however as someone</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">who does grow the majority of my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:42.639" style="s2">food i know how easy it is to up</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">right and i look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.639" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">things that my neighbors grow and things</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">that are available in the market and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">stuff like that and i compare it to my</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">own produce and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">you know what i mean i&#39;m not going but</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">the stuff i&#39;m going is not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">good it&#39;s not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">big or or not always some of it is but i</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">mean there are many many instances where</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing is not nearly as good as</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">what other people are growing right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">you know people have a knack for growing</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">things or expertise or knowledge built</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">up over time or</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">you know handed down through family or</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">whatever and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">you know i mean what we have right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">is is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">it&#39;s gone way too far in this direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">where i mean i i&#39;m pulling numbers out</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">of the air i don&#39;t know these to be true</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">numbers but probably something like 90</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">of the world&#39;s food is produced by you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">know maybe 20 or 30</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">enormous companies right around the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">world who who are responsible</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">and the rest is sort of little niche</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">suppliers um</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">and so i think what to long-term food</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">security</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">i think starts in school right where</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">every single school has</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">a little farm or whatever attached to it</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">where they grow things and keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">livestock and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">every single child as part of their</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">education is involved in</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:52.080" style="s2">you know the preparation of the land and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">the planting of the seeds and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.080" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">tending and the weeding and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">harvesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">and the preparing and the cooking and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">the serving and the cleaning up</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">and all of this stuff is integrated into</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">their school routine</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">and another really important point i</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">think you made jubilee is about how</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">people who are involved in agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">are kind of they&#39;re very much working</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">class right they&#39;re sort of down at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">bottom of the socio-economic ladders</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">certainly the farm workers maybe not so</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">the land owners but certainly the farm</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">workers are right down at the very</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">bottom and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.839" style="s2">somehow elevating that right and and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">you know this is an essential thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">there are a few things more essential</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">than food right and so those that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">produce our food for us and it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">say that everyone can&#39;t do a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">but broadly speaking there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">in any community there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">handful of people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:42.959" style="s2">like growing food or into it know about</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">it are good at it you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">and and it&#39;s right that we rely on them</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">but building in resilience at local</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">levels where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">vast majority of food production apart</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">from specialized diets like bananas</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">bananas you can only grow in tropical</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">climates if you want bananas in canada</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">you have no option but to but to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">transport them right or build huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">greenhouses whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">for the most part 90 95 percent of food</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">production could be done</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">within say i don&#39;t know a 50 mile radius</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">right of any of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">any given point and and that&#39;s so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">the three-pronged approach right one</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">introducing in schools as a really big</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:19.279" style="s2">part of the school day</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">right that an hour or two of every</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.279" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">school day is somehow involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">you know in this process of production</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">of food um elevating the status in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">society so that it&#39;s honored and paid</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">properly right and um yeah localization</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">really key in on localization of as much</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">production as possible both at an</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">individual level in your gardens</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">and at a community level in a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">fields nearby and that you know</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">the standards of uh you know resilience</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.800" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">and self-sufficiency and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">specifically where i am in my town and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">kind of the neighboring towns</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">um they have like uh maybe about 20</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:27.519" style="s2">miles away from me there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">um it&#39;s like a from the outside it looks</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">like a big</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">indoor like football stadium</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">production um and the reason they do</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">that is because in the winter they can</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">continue to grow crops and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">in my local town there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">greenhouses</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:55.519" style="s2">months have been kind of converting</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">their existing farms over into</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">you know growing new crops new products</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">and so yeah i think where i am is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">kind of an interesting case study</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">a truck and on the back of the truck</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:55.760" style="s2">there was a flag</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">it was an american flag but instead of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.760" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">instead of the stripes on the american</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">flag they were like</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">uh automatic weapons</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">so it was like you can tell where that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">where that person lies yeah that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">about i&#39;m just wondering because yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">you have food but you don&#39;t have guns</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">then it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">save it can you just allow me just to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">allow screen share for me oh yeah did i</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">not already</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:21.120" style="s2">sorry i thought you were just getting it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">ready more no i&#39;m i&#39;m ready</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.120" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">i was already ready all right i made you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">co-host oh wait do you want yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">okay yeah cool</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">that is a indoor vertical hydroponic</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">farm</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">and i mean you can build these things up</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">basically as high as you want right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">with minimal square foot energy is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">obviously the problem here right</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">they take they take a large amount of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">energy but water</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">nutrients uh all of that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:54.639" style="s2">way less than</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">than growing in soil um but yeah you you</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.639" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">need to provide light obviously</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">i mean there are versions of these where</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">you have a rotating building right where</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">you don&#39;t use artificial like use</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">natural light</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">and you have a rotating building and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">you&#39;re all four sides get exposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">sun</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">during the course of the day i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the rotation rate is but</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">every 15 minutes or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.399" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">it rotates and so it just it just uses</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">um so yeah i mean this is this seems to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">me to be the way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">very quickly i mean obviously there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">lot of investment involved right but</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">you know assuming that you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">channel the resources to it this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:28.560" style="s2">something that could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">very very quickly done and could produce</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.560" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">very large amounts of food in urban</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">environments right</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">massively reducing the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">transportation other agricultural land</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">that&#39;s needed land can then be</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">allowed to re-wild and blah blah blah i</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">mean this strikes me as long as you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">figure out a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">to produce the energy this strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">yeah really important part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.759" end="00:15:51.040" style="s2">forward especially in places where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">have cold so much of the year</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.040" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">and places that have a lot of sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">but still cold can get solar</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">um i did want to mention um something</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">that was during this section we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">to switch over to the next although i</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">think we&#39;ve done some of that part</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">um this idea of charity versus</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">and i think our our charity model of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">food has been around for so long</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">that it is going to f us over on a grand</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">scale like</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">watching what&#39;s happening with kovid</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">where all of these people</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:20.320" style="s2">were super generous when it first</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">started but now that we&#39;re eight months</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.320" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">in people like wait you asked for</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">red last month like why can&#39;t you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">your together in time it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">right there&#39;s still a pandemic going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:29.199" style="s2">they were in poverty before it ever</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:31.360" style="s2">began</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.199" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">that there becomes like when you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.360" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">access</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">you want to help people but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">too many people to help and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">you can&#39;t help them all so you end up</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">becoming like more of a horde like more</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">well i mean i get my</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:44.800" style="s2">i&#39;m entitled to this right i worked for</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">it it&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.800" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">which is fine but we like</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">being under the poverty line you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">afford both food and shelter</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">and so the food portion of that has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">taken over by charity</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">which means that the government pays you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">less and less to offset that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">so you&#39;re expected to go to the food</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">bank you&#39;re expected to go to soup</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">kitchens and do those things whereas</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">that&#39;s going to become there&#39;s more and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">more demand for it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">and less and less supply for it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">regular people who never would have done</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">that are going to need it</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:17.039" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing it not just in our own</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">localized version but also globally and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.039" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">next week when we talk about refugees</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">the same thing like</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">we want to be able to take people in but</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">there becomes a limit and we can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">know what i mean like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">our global supply food chain can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:30.960" style="s2">based on charity and yet we all</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:33.039" style="s2">could grow food right we could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">spending four to 10 hours a week in</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.039" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">fields if we didn&#39;t think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">lower class</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">thing just to volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:42.080" style="s2">yeah and if we grew up doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">loved it you know what i mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.080" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">exactly exactly and and to say well</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">where you know what is our diet</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">and how do we get it and how do we how</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:50.960" style="s2">do we do it together instead of okay if</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">these people are poor they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.960" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">given stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">and these people are rich they get</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">access to everything like how can</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">without that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">how much labor do we have to give how</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">much resources do we currently have and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">can we feed ourselves with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">and can we anyway just that we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">to see a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">cost of our charity model because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">surplus to give to charity while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">also figuring out our own</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">and feeding the world and the world is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">about to starve because</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">they followed yeah everyone has to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">home well those were our agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">workers</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">that&#39;s where the charities are so flawed</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">in the sense that all that charity ever</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">provides is the bare minimum for</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">survival to keep you alive right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">not actually elevating you to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">you know um yeah nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">but yeah yeah exactly nutrition also</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">when you go to the food bank nutrition&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">not their highest priority and of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to get produce it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">going to be potatoes and carrots it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">not going to be you know i mean kale</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">and things with it with high high</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">nutrient density and what most of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">packaged right most of it is stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:54.799" style="s2">can sit on a shelf for a while</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">and in a pandemic what we want is people</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.799" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">with high high high nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">right so that they&#39;re not as it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">that&#39;s hurt immunity that&#39;s the actual</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">like if you&#39;re less like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">easier able to fight it off and less</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:06.799" style="s2">likely to pass it on because you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">proper nutrition in your body</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.799" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what we want globally and yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see the opposite happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">and um yeah so we are 20 minutes in we</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">could probably switch over</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:17.360" style="s2">like i said we&#39;ve been very here just</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">just one more thought on this which</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.360" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve kind of already said but just</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.039" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">just just to reaffirm it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">you know for for people like us this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:26.400" style="s2">all right you know it means not that big</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">a deal it&#39;s an inconvenience</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">is all it actually is but for people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">are actually poor i mean i you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">it&#39;s important it&#39;s impossible for us to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">actually understand it i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">at an intellectual level right but i</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it in the sense that i</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:39.760" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">really put myself into feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.760" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">experience and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">i mean as is always the case it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">poor people who are least</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">able to look after themselves who bear</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">biggest brunt of the of of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">um problems so yeah yeah just i just</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">one more thing i want to add this</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:00.640" style="s2">section which is very much in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">section</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.640" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">when you talk about the just enough just</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">in time supply chain right and how</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">there&#39;s no room for growth</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked about this before that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">that&#39;s also our entire political and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">economic system is based on people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">low risk tolerance who are like we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">deal with the chaos as it comes right oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">no the pandemic&#39;s not a problem even</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">though i do about it until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">exponentially the hospitals are full now</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">we should start dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">the people who can see four steps out or</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">can just</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">you know do exponential math aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">listened to because we&#39;re looked at as</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">like chicken little the sky is falling</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">and so it&#39;s you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">when my first thoughts in march were</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">like we need to figure out food security</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">in vancouver in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna listen to me right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna listen to him but</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.679" end="00:20:44.720" style="s2">anything but especially</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh no what we need is people</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">to stay home for a month right and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:49.440" style="s2">need food</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">like this isn&#39;t if we didn&#39;t there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.440" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">reason we have supermarkets as essential</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">workers</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:54.799" style="s2">we also need agricultural workers as</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">essential workers in canada for not</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.799" end="00:20:57.919" style="s2">bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">in people from mexico we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.919" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">incentivize our own people we need to</p>

<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">happen during this which is a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">weird because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">like right now if i could have my ideal</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">version of a pandemic or let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">did need to lock ourselves down because</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">the virus was deadly enough whether you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">believe that or not we needed to take</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">the economic action to offset the health</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">i would have liked to see in place uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">systems of farmers being able to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">hey food&#39;s rotting in my fields i need</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">people to come and do this if you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">come and take the food you can have it</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">or you know what i mean come in and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:34.799" style="s2">collect it for other people that we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">more easily share where the food is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.799" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">getting wasted</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">and and offset at other places and say</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">okay like there&#39;s a bunch of potatoes</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">being buried okay well</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">could we wait a few months could we see</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">because potatoes are pretty good at</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">lasting a long time can we see if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">going to need that and we need to ship</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">it somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:52.559" style="s2">having a more um global system of when</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a famine when there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">in greenhouse which isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">going to hurt their local</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">food supply it&#39;s actually going to help</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:06.640" style="s2">them build it and help them work</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">together to say hey how much do</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.640" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">we need to put in because let&#39;s be</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">the capital and we should be</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">helping people who we&#39;ve over</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">royally in centuries past</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s ways that anyone can say</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not food secure as an individual</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">be helped with the tools of like hey</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.039" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">have you thought of 3d farming would</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">this work in your climate</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">in your culture with this what what can</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">you grow in a way to to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">to assess that supply chain the</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">growing it where is it going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">and when it breaks down how do we take</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">how do we take it up so that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">okay well if the potatoes are just</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:47.280" style="s2">rotting in the field how do we get them</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">out of the field</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.280" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">where can they go and figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">you get from point a to point b and get</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">people fed and get calories</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">in us while also having that resilience</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">of putting it in the education system</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">because this is resilience be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">grow your own food</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">means that other people can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.360" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">you anywhere near the amount right when</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">you&#39;re starving it&#39;s a lot easier to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">control you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">and if people don&#39;t have access to how</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">to build</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.720" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">build how to grow vegetables like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">planet does it for you it is the only</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">passive income it is the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">is actually going to exponentially grow</p>

<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">is a garden under permaculture and we</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">can do it with less and less labor</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">we need access to land and access to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">community and and i wish we had</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">had what i think we will have in place</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">in five years</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">five years ago so it was in place now</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">for for this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">one thing that i want to kind of mention</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">here is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">you know a lot of these things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">talking about we make the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">that we have money or we will have money</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">or the west is rich</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">or something like that um but</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">so what i do for my job is i&#39;m i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">investment analyst at a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">at a hedge fund and and so i research</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.559" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">you know economic data all day</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">and um things might get</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">rough out there and so i think when</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to think of solutions</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">um it might be within our best interest</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">to think of solutions</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">that involve maybe us not having as much</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">as we once did i think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">that are currently</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">fortunate you know as we get deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">transition phase that we&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">um you know that may not be the case</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">where you know the the once rich people</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">uh that that might start shifting um</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">so anyway i just wanted to throw that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">there yeah that was what i was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">get to this charity solidarity is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">gonna have less capacity what is your</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:57.520" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">future look like matt what does food</p>

<p begin="00:25:05.840" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">well you know i&#39;ve always been pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">health conscious</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">i think i think we have the answer i</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">i think going local just</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">hyper hyper local you know grow as much</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:27.279" style="s2">as you can yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">and in your hyper local community there</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:30.880" style="s2">might be somebody out there</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">that has a much higher growing capacity</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.880" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">than you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">and you know we already kind of live in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:38.799" style="s2">cultures where</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">farmers markets are are a thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.799" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">and i think if we increase</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">that trend i think i think we might be</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">you know if we just kind of go back to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:54.240" style="s2">how we used to do things</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">and plus we&#39;d all be healthy we&#39;d all be</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.240" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">much healthier if we did that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">eric do you want to share you already</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">shared yeah i was just going to say i</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">would i would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">pretty much the complete elimination of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">manufactured foods right of packaged</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">foods basically i&#39;d like to see the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">complete elimination of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">i would like to see people preparing</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">their own food at home not buying frozen</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2"> or dried or whatever in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">supermarket and just boiling it up or</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">microwaving it or whatever when they get</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">and this is all going to come from what</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">i said before right there you instill</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">at the level of children uh you know and</p>

<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">switch over to what we could do with ten</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">thousand people and a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">dollars and there&#39;s like a million</p>

<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">under a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">we could focus on soil health and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">permaculture and like right what is your</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">soil and how do you improve it</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">because our topsoil is eroding but we</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">also have</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">innovations that help us rejuvenate soil</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">and rejuvenate ecosystems that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">there 10 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">that are you know what i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:17.600" style="s2">biochar and stuff that actually puts it</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">back in and gives it gives the um</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.600" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">like our mono cropping and being like</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">okay soy is being planted here and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">get away with with making a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">calories with very little labor</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">but a lot of energy and it costs us our</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">planet and our</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">health permaculture helps us create</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">food in very little land well taking</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">care of the soil there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">labor involved right it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">planted it takes care of itself and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">go out and pick it and we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">with an app have all of that information</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">i mean you can find out what your soil</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">you can grow it you can create the seeds</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">and you can have a marketplace of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">sharing the seeds and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">like for me the idea of losing packaged</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">with solutions that actually draw people</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">in right no one&#39;s picking monsanto when</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">they have their local cooperative where</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">do your own thing that doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:31.760" style="s2">anything that they do</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">and you know attract more and more</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">people into doing that thing and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">every single person that starts doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">their own thing is is one less little</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">bit of power that monsanto has i mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">it is the only way i know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.720" style="s2">sound as sexy as going and blowing up</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">the monsanto center or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.720" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">oh no i&#39;m not suggesting that but if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">if you if you demolish their stock price</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">they will lose a lot of power and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">why i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">you know a market collapse</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">total market collapse would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">the it would be a godsend for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to accomplish because</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">it would just bring it not only would it</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.800" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">bring big tech but it would bring</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">monsanto and all of these evil corpse to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">their knees</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">maybe yes um and in a way i share your</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">desire for that but</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">also there would be a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">chaos calls but the other thing is as</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">well that just because</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">the stock market collapses right that</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:35.680" style="s2">those research labs and distribution</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">centers and so on and so on and so on</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">don&#39;t still exist</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">and so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s only the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">legal fiction</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">which has gone away and i&#39;m sure they</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">have security firms and lots of guns and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">blah blah blah blah blah you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:53.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure they&#39;ve thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">and have prepared for this eventuality</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.520" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">right and have and have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">plans in place far better ones and far</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">actualized than than than we do so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">that necessarily gets rid of them is my</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">point it may actually just increase</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">their grip</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s such chaos then they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">only ones that are still organized you</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">but i mean you know to be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">loans and</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">and pay employees and you know operate</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:23.440" style="s2">from their capitalist um</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">modality they need</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.440" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">the stock that i mean their stock is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">their funding mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:31.599" style="s2">so i mean if you take out if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">severely diminish their</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:36.880" style="s2">their method of funding uh that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">that will help that will help and i</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:41.440" style="s2">yeah anyway that that&#39;s a much larger</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">that&#39;s like bringing down the stock</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">market so they don&#39;t have a way of um</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">of making money and then they they stop</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">being monsanto even if they still have</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">even if they could still have a lab and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">and and whatnot um isn&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">they&#39;re highly leveraged and then they</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to make their debt</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">payments and then they have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">severely cut back their workforce and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">their research budgets</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:06.319" style="s2">and everything just has to be hugely</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">scaled back so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.319" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">that would be very very bad for them um</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:12.319" style="s2">but the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">like doing that also takes away the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.319" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">indep like our stock price</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">on our stock price and it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:18.640" style="s2">the equivalent but our incomes right our</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">incomes go down as people lose their</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.640" end="00:42:20.560" style="s2">jobs as people have all these things</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">whereas if we concentrate on the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">side of it which is like how do i feed</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">myself without monsanto</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">how do i feed myself with less and less</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">reliance on manufactured</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">nestle products um which were probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">all owned by nestle even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">an even though they used to not be they</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:38.560" style="s2">used to be organic and good and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">still are but they&#39;re under that guys</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.560" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">because they could see it that there was</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.599" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">profit in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:47.119" style="s2">and to be able to work like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">there&#39;s this math that i&#39;m sure i do and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.119" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">a lot of people do in their head like</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">okay if i make twenty dollars an hour</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.880" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">why would i grow my own food when it</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">costs exit right like</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">like i grew my own tomatoes and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">were little cherry tomatoes and i was</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">like oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">i like cherry tomatoes but this entire</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">plant gave me one box of them so</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">looking after it all year gave me the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">equivalent of five dollars worth</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">that&#39;s 15 minutes i put more than 15</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">minutes into this like but whereas</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">i have cherry tomatoes i can still eat</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">them like removing the math of did my</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:15.520" style="s2">labor</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.680" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">how much of my labor was here and just</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">hey ten thousand of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">working together putting in money would</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">be more than a hundred thousand putting</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:25.520" style="s2">in money for a 3d farm putting in money</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">for just to putting in our labor on</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.520" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">farms that already exist and are just</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">going to destroy their food</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:32.079" style="s2">and like how do we collectively figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">out how</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.079" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">my meal gets made not just how do i grow</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">my own food because</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s going to go to waste if i have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">cook it into food</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.800" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">whereas like together we can create how</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.599" style="s2">do we feed ourselves and remove</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">instead of okay we have to pay people 20</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.599" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">bucks to be in the field</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:52.480" style="s2">all of the vault all of the time and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">labor and resources it takes to get us</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.480" end="00:43:55.920" style="s2">fed can we distribute that amongst</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">ourselves and anyone can come in and do</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.920" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">that any you know it doesn&#39;t matter if</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">you&#39;re rich or poor</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:01.839" style="s2">it costs you 10 hours a week to get your</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:04.240" style="s2">food delivered to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.839" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">all of your meals delivered ten i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.240" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">know how much hours that would actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:10.160" style="s2">but ten hours who you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">everyone to do that you would need 10</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.160" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">000 people locally to do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.839" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">and to figure out you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:17.440" style="s2">necessarily give them 100 of their food</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">but it starts at 10 and grows and grows</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.440" end="00:44:22.400" style="s2">and grows it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:24.160" style="s2">a meal their evening meal</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.400" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">and then and then figuring out reverse</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.160" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s like dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">individuals and finding out where do you</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">get your food and how could you get your</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">food and when you</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">teach people and allow people to grow</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">their own food they already have that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">resilience because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">especially when they&#39;re working together</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">having your own farm and growing your</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">own food is powerful but doing it with</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">your neighbor so you know if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">drought someone a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">drought would be hard but if yours your</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">stuff doesn&#39;t has a micro</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">climate that makes it not work and</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">someone else&#39;s does there&#39;s enough food</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">to go around if your whole place has a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">drought</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">one of the other local places doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">and they know that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not monsanto we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">relying on the charity</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">or horrible business practice of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">monsanto we can create systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">come participate and you get it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">have to pay you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">and pay out wages and pay that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">it&#39;s about like utilizing</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">our volunteer hours utilizing the sun</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">utilizing the soil and making it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">healthier</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">it just had a thought and this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">completely off topic but</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">real quick um what if we do</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">a solution raising some time and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">the purpose of the solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">would be to find</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">solutions on how to even acquire</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">thousand dollars because without that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">all of the solutions that we think of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.119" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">for these topics</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">you know that then if if we have that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:45.520" style="s2">kind of bolted down</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">uh it might be interesting because we</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.520" end="00:45:49.920" style="s2">could actually kind of push through</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">some of these uh ideas we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">anyway yeah there&#39;s um we&#39;d actually it</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">was the one thing we somewhat failed at</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">we had a switch and raising on solution</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">raising and we&#39;ve come up with powerful</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">solutions for prisons and everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">else but the solution raising on</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:07.920" style="s2">it was a little bit it just didn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t come up with anything necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.920" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">but my brain has so i am creating a</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">meta-learning magic which will get us to</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:16.000" style="s2">10 000 people put</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">in 25 a month which will get us</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.000" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">resources and it just started yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">with our the first day of our six-week</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">course so there is stuff in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">in the pipelines and after the six week</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">course there will be more six week</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">courses that will be offered to more</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:30.000" style="s2">people and more people</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">and exponential growth and it will yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">because we come with powerful solutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">but if they can&#39;t go anywhere there</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t a way to get 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">what the f is the point um do you mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:41.280" style="s2">do you mind sending me some</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">just shoot me an email with some info on</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.280" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">that i&#39;d love to check it out</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">sure yeah i have a few unlisted videos i</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">can i can i can send you</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:49.520" style="s2">you can see the progression because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.000" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s awesome it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.520" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">as with me it&#39;s like it&#39;s somewhat</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">true right that for</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">centuries millennia whatever there has</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:15.760" style="s2">been this very small group of people who</p>

<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">and figured out more and more</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">sophisticated ways of enslaving</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:28.079" style="s2">populations without them even knowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re enslaved</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.079" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">um and that there is the point has now</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">been reached where human beings are no</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">longer the most valuable resources on</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:37.680" style="s2">this planet and there is a cult</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">there is a cull going on and so all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.680" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">this thing we&#39;re seeing in collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">food chains</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">faults of the syst this is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">externalities ejected by the system but</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">the actual purpose of the system right</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">this is the goal</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">how does that change these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">that we have for you</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">if that were the case it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t i mean i&#39;m a kind of already</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">under the premise of both like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">chaotic it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">the opposite of beloved malignant</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">neglect that it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">the like externalities of people working</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">on their own self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">yeah kind of i kind of i kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">that too but i&#39;m just saying if it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">even if it is either way they may want</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">to kill me they may want to kill other</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">people it&#39;s part of why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">distributing it right it doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not one leader it&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">one piece of technology it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.520" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">can&#39;t take out</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">one one pillar and have it crumble it</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">needs to be resilient it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">something of like yes and even if this</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">person dies</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">everything continues and part of what</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">the mlm that we&#39;re creating is doing um</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">is it doesn&#39;t rely on facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:51.280" style="s2">youtube&#39;s algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">right because i mean i don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.280" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">think they&#39;ve grey blocked me i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:55.920" style="s2">actually think i&#39;m important enough i</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">just think i kind of suck at youtube</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.920" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">my point my point is though jubilee if</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">you&#39;re let&#39;s assume you&#39;re mlm you like</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">is incredibly successful right in six</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">months from now you&#39;ve got 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">and lots of things going on and blah</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">blah blah blah blah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:08.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s still growing exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">right and in six months you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.400" end="00:50:11.119" style="s2">have a million and six months later</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have 100 million right</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.119" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">yep as soon as you become an actual</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">threat</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:19.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying the difference</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.040" end="00:50:21.440" style="s2">the difference between it being</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">externalities that have gone wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">it being deliberate is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">create something that does actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">start to really solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">you are now a threat to this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.160" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">now they just come and boss you off</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">right you get you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">dragged off the guantanamo or two in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:37.599" style="s2">back of the head or whatever it might be</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">yeah no i was always making this with</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.599" end="00:50:40.559" style="s2">the idea that that is absolutely what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">going to happen i will be murdered for</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.559" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t matter because all of my</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:46.480" style="s2"> is out there and because of how</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:48.319" style="s2">we&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:49.839" style="s2">right it&#39;s not every one of the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.319" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">the 10 000 if necessary</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.839" end="00:50:54.800" style="s2">as well i mean right they would have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">find all of them and kill</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.800" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">right and killing five people is hard</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">enough killing ten thousand people isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">even with</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">all like it&#39;s they can&#39;t do that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">just can&#39;t now</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:05.760" style="s2">and if they do that&#39;s ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">people distributed all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">are like wait they were all into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:11.119" style="s2">that might happen in which case we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:13.839" style="s2"> does humanity and wife try</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.119" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">like if they can if they will succeed at</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">stopping us no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:19.440" style="s2">right that&#39;s not a guarantee even if</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">that is the case so i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:24.640" style="s2">i&#39;m actually hugely into</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you you guys have heard</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.640" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">of the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.480" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">daos decentralized autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">um and actually jubilee you you spoke</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">with</p>

<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:46.480" style="s2">kind of building a governance</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">system uh to create um</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.480" end="00:51:53.200" style="s2">daos and um</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">i i think that that solves</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">this issue and and the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">we all form a dao and the dao could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.800" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">you know comprised of 10 a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">thousand</p>

<p begin="00:52:48.480" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">discussing i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:53.920" style="s2">you kill one of us and there&#39;s you know</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">sue</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">you know that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.000" end="00:53:11.839" style="s2">that&#39;s what i see as our kind of saving</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">grace in</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.839" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">in this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">it requires the internet sure but you</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:21.280" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">if we don&#39;t have the internet we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.280" end="00:53:26.000" style="s2">much bigger problems on our hand</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:27.680" style="s2">here so hopefully we can keep that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.000" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">running and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">you know i mean if people start losing</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:34.480" style="s2">access to the internet</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">uh you know hopefully there&#39;s backup</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.480" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">systems or</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">or whatever but yeah in the streets for</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.839" end="00:53:44.559" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.079" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">then they also lose a lot of power as</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.559" end="00:53:48.800" style="s2">well so i think the internet</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">is kind of a a commons which if i&#39;m then</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.800" end="00:53:52.319" style="s2">i feel if i&#39;m them i&#39;ve already built my</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">own second internet right for the day</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.319" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">that we need to shut this internet down</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">because we can&#39;t control it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s part of creating dot</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">like is creating something i mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">holochain has their own</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">their own internet and their own and i</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">don&#39;t rely on either dow stack or</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">holochain because neither of them have</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.640" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">like done the thing that they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">they don&#39;t exist yet so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.839" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">creative cool projects that need each</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:16.960" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s that that&#39;s the technology</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.960" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">piece which i do think is coming down</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">the line</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:22.400" style="s2">there&#39;s well i think matan was talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">about uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:26.559" style="s2">commons uh he was talking to you about</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">commons and i think they&#39;re very close</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:29.839" style="s2">to launching the commons app which</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">essentially will be</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.839" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">an iphone app where you could go and</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:37.040" style="s2">create your own dao that that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.760" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">you know jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">saves the world and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2">we we could all vote on proposals on</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">what to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.000" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">we could all you know donate money it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:50.799" style="s2">kind of similar to this</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">you know mlm type type thing but</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">you know in kind of a more updated way</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">yeah i mean yeah the the i when i talk</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">to a lot of people they they always</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">bring up you know well what if the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">internet goes down</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">i i really can&#39;t argue with that but</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">but assuming it doesn&#39;t go down</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:12.799" style="s2">these these technologies are very very</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">very close</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.799" end="00:55:17.839" style="s2">to to being ready for the mainstream so</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">yeah i would just i would i would</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.839" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">consider those and look into them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">no i i just i</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">every like people are creating things</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">relying on the dial stack being they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">relying on holochain being there and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">like well what if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">like great project but if dallas staff</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen can you still exist right</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">you still need the local self-sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">resilient community</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:41.760" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s yeah all right so we are</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">at the hour</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.760" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">i would like to do what we normally do</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">which is go back to our topic</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">and uh resiliency what is the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">powerful thing you think we could do</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:52.480" style="s2">with ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">to help with food sovereignty in our</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">lives in the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">that could could potentially take place</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">if we did have those ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.559" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">who are willing to put in 10 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:08.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how much it would cost to</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">build a small vertical farm</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.799" end="00:56:12.400" style="s2">in a town or a city somewhere but if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">could get 10 000 people in the same city</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.400" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">100 000 i dare so you could build at</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:17.599" style="s2">least a small one right and this could</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.599" end="00:56:20.960" style="s2">more of a symbol than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">right look look at this thing right</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.960" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">so cool it takes up a few square</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:25.119" style="s2">meters and it produces x amount of</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.119" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">you know every month or every year or</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2">whatever you know if we had</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">50 of these in the city that&#39;s it we</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need to ship any vegetables in</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.839" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">you know we can grow what we want year</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">round</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">and i mean with an indoor environment</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.079" end="00:56:38.799" style="s2">you can grow things like strawberries</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:40.160" style="s2">and lemons and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.799" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">well lemons is a bad example because</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.160" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">that&#39;s trees but you know the baby you</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.839" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">can grow sort of subtropical kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">even in even in temperate zones so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">i like that i like that i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">roughly in the sort of scale</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">my vote would be to create a a food</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">security dao</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">and then the members of that dao uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:03.760" style="s2">that have pooled the capital together</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">would then vote</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.760" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">on proposals to create these types of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">indoor vertical farming solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.240" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:14.240" style="s2">and then the dao would then be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:17.839" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">to then go out and fulfill solutions</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.839" end="00:57:21.680" style="s2">like that that that would that would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">my vote</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.680" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">i would like um 10 000 people in</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:28.000" style="s2">vancouver to get together</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">and create a local vegan delivery</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">service that was delicious and cheap</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t have all the waste that all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:34.559" style="s2">other ones do um because that would help</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">me the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">in my life i don&#39;t need i&#39;m not vegan</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.119" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">but i feel like vegan is more</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:42.559" style="s2">more universal and more you could have</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">one meal that works for more</p>
