<p begin="00:01:34.580" end="00:01:40.220" style="s2">material reality and the necessity for</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.040" end="00:01:43.160" style="s2">us to move beyond theory and actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.220" end="00:01:46.520" style="s2">into practice and mobilization in order</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.160" end="00:01:48.620" style="s2">to actually do systems change and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.520" end="00:01:50.570" style="s2">wanted to bring Christopher on to the</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.960" end="00:02:04.970" style="s2">a political reality and I really wanted</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.570" end="00:02:08.690" style="s2">to talk to Christopher about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.970" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">reclamation of politics itself how can</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.690" end="00:02:14.269" style="s2">we reorder standing of what political</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:17.900" style="s2">action is what taking on the inheritance</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.269" end="00:02:20.840" style="s2">of our forebears it is and stepping into</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.900" end="00:02:22.760" style="s2">stewardship so thank you Christopher for</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:27.439" style="s2">coming today and to talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.760" end="00:02:29.260" style="s2">these subjects I&#39;m really happy to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.439" end="00:02:33.140" style="s2">here Ravin thank you for the invitation</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.260" end="00:02:35.690" style="s2">yeah so I wanted to start with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.140" end="00:02:38.030" style="s2">question just what is what is Alwyn</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.690" end="00:02:40.520" style="s2">leadership and what role does it have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.030" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">play in the reclamation of our politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.520" end="00:02:57.880" style="s2">I was fortunate enough about nine years</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">ago to have met a kind of misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.880" end="00:03:02.990" style="s2">very intelligent man Encinitas named</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:05.390" style="s2">Daniels from October that most people</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.990" end="00:03:08.030" style="s2">had never heard of the floor and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.390" end="00:03:15.080" style="s2">became a very dear friend and a mentor</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.030" end="00:03:17.330" style="s2">and I learned a lot from him before he</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.080" end="00:03:20.540" style="s2">was ever creating content that many of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.330" end="00:03:26.240" style="s2">you were able to find and we work</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.540" end="00:03:28.900" style="s2">together in multiple capacities and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.240" end="00:03:32.330" style="s2">helped open up a world of thinking as</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.900" end="00:03:37.100" style="s2">well as deeply supported my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.330" end="00:03:40.790" style="s2">transformational process and the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.100" end="00:03:43.460" style="s2">center of of all of that mentorship was</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.790" end="00:03:46.460" style="s2">around the notion of an omni win/win</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.460" end="00:03:48.410" style="s2">world that would require us to be Omni</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.460" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">considerate in order to create an omni</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.410" end="00:03:55.570" style="s2">win/win world and so all when leadership</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:59.630" style="s2">is nothing more than an omni</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.570" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">consideration and Omni win-win as -</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.630" end="00:04:03.710" style="s2">Martin Berger would articulate it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">just packaged in a way that&#39;s accessible</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.710" end="00:04:08.690" style="s2">and palatable to the average person and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:12.760" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s not brought forward as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.690" end="00:04:15.110" style="s2">technical term or a theoretical or</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.760" end="00:04:18.440" style="s2">intellectual term but actually a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.110" end="00:04:22.220" style="s2">practical concept that we can each</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.440" end="00:04:24.530" style="s2">strive to embody on a day to day basis</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.220" end="00:04:26.840" style="s2">on a moment-to-moment basis based upon</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.530" end="00:04:29.330" style="s2">the scales of influence that we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.840" end="00:04:32.150" style="s2">available to us whether that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.330" end="00:04:34.100" style="s2">person in front of you or a team that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.150" end="00:04:35.810" style="s2">you work with an organization or if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.100" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">find yourself with a larger capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.810" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">influence over that domain that you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">influence over in service to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:49.309" style="s2">us positively impacting all beings that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:54.389" style="s2">were able to have influence over and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.309" end="00:04:57.749" style="s2">when is a technical term which I refer</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.389" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">to as the augmentation of choices so for</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.749" end="00:05:03.029" style="s2">someone to win is for them to win more</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:09.379" style="s2">choices for someone to lose is to lose</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.029" end="00:05:11.999" style="s2">choices so win isn&#39;t just a a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.379" end="00:05:13.499" style="s2">notion that that doesn&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.999" end="00:05:16.589" style="s2">grounding rod actually has a very very</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.499" end="00:05:19.349" style="s2">specific grounding rod which is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.589" end="00:05:22.050" style="s2">that augmentation of choice so to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.349" end="00:05:24.870" style="s2">all win to be all win to be an all when</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.050" end="00:05:29.099" style="s2">leader is to live on a moment-to-moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.870" end="00:05:30.449" style="s2">basis with the intent and hopefully the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.099" end="00:05:33.509" style="s2">capacity to follow through with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.449" end="00:05:36.810" style="s2">intent to some degree of efficacy to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.509" end="00:05:40.620" style="s2">expanding the choices of those that were</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.810" end="00:05:41.849" style="s2">impacting and forced landries quo which</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.620" end="00:05:44.399" style="s2">I&#39;m sure many of you are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.849" end="00:05:45.599" style="s2">is love is that which enables choice so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.399" end="00:05:47.249" style="s2">we talked about Winnie and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.599" end="00:05:48.649" style="s2">about the augmentation of choice we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.249" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">actually talking about a very practical</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.649" end="00:05:54.020" style="s2">manifestation of love in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:06:01.349" style="s2">it&#39;s very powerful it almost rips open</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.020" end="00:06:04.439" style="s2">themes of our previous concept of love</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.349" end="00:06:06.349" style="s2">and of love and reality where love moves</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.439" end="00:06:10.919" style="s2">from this notion of an attractive force</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.349" end="00:06:14.279" style="s2">to this this fierce force of an abling</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.919" end="00:06:16.499" style="s2">choice and then you know what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.279" end="00:06:18.449" style="s2">previously called love gets words like</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.499" end="00:06:20.069" style="s2">affinity and gets words like attraction</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.449" end="00:06:22.129" style="s2">it gets words like romance it gets words</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.069" end="00:06:26.430" style="s2">like all these other things but love</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.129" end="00:06:30.139" style="s2">love is this force that expands the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.430" end="00:06:33.029" style="s2">choices of those that are around us from</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.139" end="00:06:37.459" style="s2">from the direct people we influence all</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.029" end="00:06:37.459" style="s2">the way to people that we care about</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.089" end="00:06:43.649" style="s2">not that we in people who care about</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.050" end="00:06:55.409" style="s2">be an all when leader is to want to show</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.990" end="00:06:56.770" style="s2">up in a way that is opening up the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.409" end="00:07:00.099" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.770" end="00:07:02.740" style="s2">of people across the world and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.099" end="00:07:04.810" style="s2">throughout time and that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.740" end="00:07:06.759" style="s2">sophisticated thing to orient to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.810" end="00:07:10.870" style="s2">why we call it an ideal that we aspire</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.759" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">to you don&#39;t have to know that every</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.870" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">single choice you make is going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:18.539" style="s2">positively influence the expansion of</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.539" end="00:07:26.650" style="s2">but why not aspire to that why not why</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.080" end="00:07:29.860" style="s2">not use that as a as an ideal to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.650" end="00:07:32.199" style="s2">practice and to vet your own choices</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.860" end="00:07:34.599" style="s2">against and when you get feedback that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.199" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">your choice is actually undermined the</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.949" end="00:07:46.680" style="s2">ideal and have that positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.650" end="00:07:49.389" style="s2">loop and what would the world be like if</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.680" end="00:07:51.880" style="s2">hundreds of us thousands of us millions</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.389" end="00:07:55.270" style="s2">of us had this positive feedback with of</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.470" end="00:08:07.300" style="s2">have available to them mm-hmm yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.430" end="00:08:10.150" style="s2">do you feel like we can inspire people</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.300" end="00:08:13.090" style="s2">into this like kind of deep reverence</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.150" end="00:08:15.430" style="s2">and understanding of the significance of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.090" end="00:08:17.139" style="s2">taking those types of actions it seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.430" end="00:08:19.810" style="s2">like many of us are kind of at an</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.139" end="00:08:22.539" style="s2">impasse where even if we do and have an</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.810" end="00:08:25.719" style="s2">impulse to do something we haven&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.539" end="00:08:27.669" style="s2">realized what right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.719" end="00:08:29.819" style="s2">that impulse would be and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.669" end="00:08:33.339" style="s2">many people who have just completely</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.819" end="00:08:35.860" style="s2">written off that type of action because</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.339" end="00:08:39.339" style="s2">the particular manifestations of</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.339" end="00:08:45.430" style="s2">gating I think what what politics could</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.370" end="00:08:48.010" style="s2">be and I&#39;m kind of curious like how do</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.430" end="00:08:55.630" style="s2">you think that we can draw that type of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.010" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">inspiration out of people well I feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.630" end="00:09:03.220" style="s2">like life is do you mean the vast</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:08.110" style="s2">majority of the initiating which is good</p>

<p begin="00:09:10.180" end="00:09:17.649" style="s2">the conscience of others but what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.790" end="00:09:19.450" style="s2">way that I feel like we play with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.649" end="00:09:23.710" style="s2">of conscious co-creators with life</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.450" end="00:09:25.779" style="s2">herself is to help to crystallize the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.710" end="00:09:30.850" style="s2">consciousness as its raison is as</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.779" end="00:09:33.570" style="s2">emerging so that people can ground what</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.850" end="00:09:38.589" style="s2">they&#39;re experiencing as their awareness</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.570" end="00:09:42.520" style="s2">expands and so I think that having terms</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.589" end="00:09:45.010" style="s2">like all win and all in for all life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.520" end="00:09:46.899" style="s2">having bodies of work around both of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.010" end="00:09:48.610" style="s2">those things and I I do happen to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.899" end="00:09:50.770" style="s2">an unpublished book called all in for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.610" end="00:09:53.550" style="s2">life another one called Alwyn both those</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.770" end="00:09:57.940" style="s2">will likely be coming out this year</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.550" end="00:10:02.100" style="s2">then then you help to crystallize this</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.940" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">consciousness as that then allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.100" end="00:10:06.790" style="s2">orient around it more intentionally it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:08.529" style="s2">allows us to think about and contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.790" end="00:10:10.390" style="s2">it and hold ourselves accountable to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.529" end="00:10:13.720" style="s2">these standards it helps us to give us</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.390" end="00:10:16.089" style="s2">an overt domain to practice amongst our</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.720" end="00:10:19.570" style="s2">communities so it just kind of gives us</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.089" end="00:10:23.950" style="s2">this context to intentionally cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.570" end="00:10:25.779" style="s2">that way of being and I feel like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.950" end="00:10:29.529" style="s2">that that&#39;s a role that I have to play</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.779" end="00:10:33.910" style="s2">and that we can all play and when people</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.529" end="00:10:36.040" style="s2">are feeling wow yeah I I want to create</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.910" end="00:10:38.350" style="s2">a world that works for all I want my</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.040" end="00:10:40.660" style="s2">actions to actually be loving in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.350" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">sense that they&#39;re their expanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.660" end="00:10:45.330" style="s2">choice in improving the quality of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:48.370" style="s2">human society or human civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.330" end="00:10:51.610" style="s2">now where do I start well we have we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.370" end="00:10:53.380" style="s2">call our five steps or five stages or</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.610" end="00:11:00.070" style="s2">five principles of Alwyn leadership</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.380" end="00:11:03.370" style="s2">which is a type fractal of a path that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.070" end="00:11:05.140" style="s2">is relevant at the scale of a moment and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.370" end="00:11:07.540" style="s2">it&#39;s also relevant at the scale of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.140" end="00:11:09.520" style="s2">career and at many scales in between so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.540" end="00:11:13.660" style="s2">it&#39;s this kind of a whole onic</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.520" end="00:11:16.300" style="s2">expandable protocol that we offer all</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.660" end="00:11:18.970" style="s2">when leaders to help them to orient to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.300" end="00:11:20.500" style="s2">all in action and and what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.970" end="00:11:23.950" style="s2">like is step number one is know yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.500" end="00:11:25.630" style="s2">so understand yourself again at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.950" end="00:11:27.370" style="s2">scale of a moment this is one of my</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.630" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">thoughts one of my feelings you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.370" end="00:11:31.540" style="s2">what what what is my experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">ten minutes late to this recorded thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.540" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">that I thought was starting to love him</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:37.590" style="s2">is actually starting at 10 and like what</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:41.080" style="s2">is that experience for me in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.590" end="00:11:44.200" style="s2">all the way to in a macro sense knowing</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.080" end="00:11:46.510" style="s2">yourself your skills your shadows your</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.200" end="00:11:52.210" style="s2">capacities your aspirations your visions</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.510" end="00:11:53.980" style="s2">like really knowing yourself and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.210" end="00:11:56.440" style="s2">believe you need to actually know</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.980" end="00:11:59.530" style="s2">yourself to a certain degree of solidity</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.440" end="00:12:02.770" style="s2">and security before you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.530" end="00:12:03.880" style="s2">setting a perspective aside and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.770" end="00:12:05.620" style="s2">being able to get into perspective</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.880" end="00:12:08.140" style="s2">enough of another in order to know</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.620" end="00:12:10.180" style="s2">another and so the second step then is</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.140" end="00:12:11.800" style="s2">to they know each other and have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.180" end="00:12:13.270" style="s2">commitment to be able to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.800" end="00:12:15.100" style="s2">and participate in a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.270" end="00:12:16.990" style="s2">experience of others so we can really</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:19.060" style="s2">connect to their world see the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.990" end="00:12:21.070" style="s2">from their perspective understand what</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.060" end="00:12:22.900" style="s2">matters to them what their pains are</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.070" end="00:12:26.080" style="s2">what their aspirations are how they</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.900" end="00:12:27.220" style="s2">perceive reality and that moves us into</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.080" end="00:12:28.690" style="s2">a relationship it gets us into</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.220" end="00:12:30.840" style="s2">collective intelligence because</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.690" end="00:12:32.950" style="s2">collective intelligence is really the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.840" end="00:12:35.470" style="s2">interpenetration of our subjective</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.950" end="00:12:38.740" style="s2">experiences able to wire together as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.470" end="00:12:40.330" style="s2">as a super collective so we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.740" end="00:12:41.620" style="s2">ourselves and know each other in order</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.330" end="00:12:44.440" style="s2">to experience that collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.620" end="00:12:46.210" style="s2">intelligence and then that positions us</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.440" end="00:12:47.980" style="s2">to better know the world because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.210" end="00:12:49.900" style="s2">world itself is massively complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.980" end="00:12:51.730" style="s2">there&#39;s more to know about any aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.900" end="00:12:53.170" style="s2">the world that anyone will ever know but</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.730" end="00:12:56.620" style="s2">through collective intelligence we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.170" end="00:13:02.470" style="s2">better metabolize what is so see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.620" end="00:13:04.030" style="s2">world from different perspectives does</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.470" end="00:13:05.950" style="s2">that one of those spiritual things we</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.030" end="00:13:08.110" style="s2">can do is proactively pursue diverse</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.950" end="00:13:10.210" style="s2">perspectives and one of the reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.110" end="00:13:12.190" style="s2">that is because that enables us to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.210" end="00:13:14.140" style="s2">a better understanding of reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.190" end="00:13:15.250" style="s2">because the more diverse perspectives we</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.140" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">can look at reality through the more</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.250" end="00:13:18.010" style="s2">different facets we&#39;re gonna see and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:20.020" style="s2">understand and therefore the better</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.010" end="00:13:21.820" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna understand reality and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.020" end="00:13:24.100" style="s2">more that we understand how reality is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.820" end="00:13:26.230" style="s2">first just how we think reality might be</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.100" end="00:13:28.410" style="s2">the more effective we are to take action</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.230" end="00:13:31.900" style="s2">that&#39;s actually useful to the whole and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.410" end="00:13:33.880" style="s2">so that know the world then leads the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.900" end="00:13:35.650" style="s2">fourth step which is to run all in</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.880" end="00:13:37.300" style="s2">experiments because it&#39;s not all win</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.650" end="00:13:39.970" style="s2">isn&#39;t something you can will</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.300" end="00:13:44.170" style="s2">Alwyn isn&#39;t necessarily a direct act of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.970" end="00:13:46.060" style="s2">volition Alwyn is a context you&#39;ve set</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.170" end="00:13:48.250" style="s2">up for yourself the experiment within</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.060" end="00:13:50.649" style="s2">and then you learn through the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.250" end="00:13:52.870" style="s2">loops and the results of what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.649" end="00:13:56.350" style="s2">generate and produced actually verify</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.870" end="00:14:01.029" style="s2">what actually was Omni considerate what</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.350" end="00:14:05.019" style="s2">was actually was Omni win-win B because</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.029" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">it&#39;s only through touching an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.019" end="00:14:10.450" style="s2">what might be Alwyn to reality itself to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:12.100" style="s2">that touchstone of reality and in</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.450" end="00:14:15.190" style="s2">getting that feedback that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.100" end="00:14:17.260" style="s2">find out what did or didn&#39;t work in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.190" end="00:14:20.680" style="s2">way the envision might be so so we we</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.260" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">collapse all in action into fully</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.680" end="00:14:25.540" style="s2">contextualized by all in experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:26.680" style="s2">so we&#39;re just constantly taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.540" end="00:14:29.079" style="s2">experiments because if we connect to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.680" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">ourselves each other and the world then</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.079" end="00:14:33.910" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna naturally give us ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:36.519" style="s2">new possibilities I mean convert those</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.910" end="00:14:37.779" style="s2">ideas into experiments and that to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.519" end="00:14:40.060" style="s2">experiment again that you can run in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.779" end="00:14:42.070" style="s2">moment which is it which is that which</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.060" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">is a humble form of action because you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.070" end="00:14:44.980" style="s2">know there&#39;s like confidence behind that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:47.589" style="s2">action as though this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.980" end="00:14:51.790" style="s2">that&#39;s going to work but it&#39;s a play off</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.589" end="00:14:55.060" style="s2">of a line from the daodejing where Lao</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.790" end="00:14:57.399" style="s2">Tzu says the Masters walk through life</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.060" end="00:15:01.329" style="s2">as though they&#39;re walking across a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.399" end="00:15:03.579" style="s2">frozen brook so that&#39;s this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.329" end="00:15:05.260" style="s2">well I don&#39;t really know but I think and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.579" end="00:15:08.050" style="s2">I&#39;m confident gonna take an action i I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.260" end="00:15:09.610" style="s2">put my confidence behind my capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.050" end="00:15:11.230" style="s2">generate experiments in a moment small</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.610" end="00:15:13.060" style="s2">basis I and in relationship with the</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.060" end="00:15:18.040" style="s2">actually worked and so we run that cycle</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.270" end="00:15:20.620" style="s2">of know yourself know each other know</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.040" end="00:15:22.660" style="s2">the world run all in experiments and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.620" end="00:15:25.089" style="s2">then the fifth pillars is is empower</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.660" end="00:15:26.380" style="s2">other Alwyn leaders which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.089" end="00:15:28.060" style="s2">the thing I talked about at the very</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.380" end="00:15:29.890" style="s2">beginning which is initiating this</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.060" end="00:15:32.020" style="s2">crystallization of consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.890" end="00:15:33.910" style="s2">people who are one team to experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.020" end="00:15:37.180" style="s2">their own all in leadership and if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.910" end="00:15:39.940" style="s2">run those five steps then something is</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.180" end="00:15:44.050" style="s2">going to start to emerge and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.940" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">gonna start to do things that are what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.050" end="00:15:50.350" style="s2">call creating paradise because because</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:51.750" style="s2">to do something that&#39;s all win is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.350" end="00:15:54.810" style="s2">open up a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.750" end="00:15:58.290" style="s2">beautiful possibility that was that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.810" end="00:16:01.320" style="s2">wasn&#39;t actualized yet it opens up</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:05.190" style="s2">something new and I caught all that</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.320" end="00:16:06.870" style="s2">opening in Paradise choice gets opened</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.190" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">up quality of life gets opened up new</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.870" end="00:16:10.860" style="s2">possibilities get opened up and so as</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:13.230" style="s2">all with leaders we become Paradise</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.860" end="00:16:14.370" style="s2">makers and we want to make paradise the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.230" end="00:16:16.080" style="s2">scale of our household gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.370" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">paradise the scale of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.080" end="00:16:21.030" style="s2">collective of humanity and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:23.220" style="s2">that&#39;s what circles back around the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.030" end="00:16:25.530" style="s2">conversation around politics which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.220" end="00:16:27.690" style="s2">happy to actually jump right into that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.530" end="00:16:29.490" style="s2">element unless you&#39;d like to ask them a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.690" end="00:16:31.230" style="s2">question or go somewhere else go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.490" end="00:16:33.540" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been appropriate time to just</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.230" end="00:16:35.250" style="s2">circle back around with that final piece</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.540" end="00:16:38.390" style="s2">around the reclamation of politics</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.250" end="00:16:40.710" style="s2">mm-hmm though as an almond leader</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.390" end="00:16:43.290" style="s2">devoted to creating paradise at every</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.710" end="00:16:45.540" style="s2">scale we can possibly influence then we</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.290" end="00:16:48.930" style="s2">have to have a real serious conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.540" end="00:16:52.410" style="s2">around power and power is a topic that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.930" end="00:16:54.510" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t cycle in all the game be</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.410" end="00:16:56.370" style="s2">conversations although I care</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.510" end="00:16:58.860" style="s2">tremendously about it just not the space</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.370" end="00:17:01.830" style="s2">that I spend I don&#39;t read the content or</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.860" end="00:17:06.240" style="s2">watch the content but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.830" end="00:17:09.510" style="s2">hear that this notion of power is really</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.240" end="00:17:11.160" style="s2">a central concept but but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.510" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">critical concept or so power is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.160" end="00:17:21.480" style="s2">ability to achieve an intention thanks</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:24.780" style="s2">Alexa oh the power is this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.480" end="00:17:26.550" style="s2">achieve an outcome and so if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.780" end="00:17:28.530" style="s2">create a more beautiful world that our</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.550" end="00:17:30.600" style="s2">heart knows as possible we have to take</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.530" end="00:17:33.540" style="s2">this power conversation extremely</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.600" end="00:17:37.110" style="s2">seriously and it&#39;s right for us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.540" end="00:17:38.880" style="s2">desire to become more powerful right in</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.110" end="00:17:40.500" style="s2">some ways power itself has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.880" end="00:17:44.340" style="s2">something that&#39;s been polarized against</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.500" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">or it&#39;s been it&#39;s been attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.340" end="00:17:48.840" style="s2">those who abuse power as powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:52.050" style="s2">therefore we don&#39;t want to be like them</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.840" end="00:17:54.600" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s not good to pursue power</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.050" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">desire to be powerful but I invite all</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.600" end="00:18:04.120" style="s2">of us to reclaim power and to realize</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:06.770" style="s2">that we can&#39;t achieve our vision</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.120" end="00:18:09.020" style="s2">of a recreated transformed human</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.770" end="00:18:13.400" style="s2">civilization without becoming extremely</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.020" end="00:18:14.870" style="s2">powerful and and politics and government</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.400" end="00:18:19.130" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say government not politics</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.870" end="00:18:23.210" style="s2">government is in a lot of ways the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.130" end="00:18:24.800" style="s2">effective harnessing of power that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.210" end="00:18:27.830" style="s2">humans have ever created</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.800" end="00:18:32.900" style="s2">right this ability to to tax and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.830" end="00:18:36.220" style="s2">generate public resources this is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.900" end="00:18:41.330" style="s2">ability to create laws that actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.220" end="00:18:43.910" style="s2">directly influence the how society</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.330" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">operates the operating system of society</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.910" end="00:18:50.270" style="s2">and civilization and most importantly</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">the the this the crux of the power the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.270" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">government holds is its legitimate or</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:58.730" style="s2">legal use over violence the government</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:19:01.960" style="s2">has the legal ability to physically do</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.730" end="00:19:07.070" style="s2">something to you if you do or don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.960" end="00:19:09.590" style="s2">comply with its policies it also has the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.070" end="00:19:12.530" style="s2">legitimate or legal use of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.590" end="00:19:15.170" style="s2">inflict violence unilaterally upon other</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.530" end="00:19:19.010" style="s2">countries or other actors it also has</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.170" end="00:19:24.429" style="s2">the budgets to be able to augment the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.010" end="00:19:28.990" style="s2">capacity to inflict violence in profound</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.429" end="00:19:32.260" style="s2">persistent abilities so this power is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.990" end="00:19:36.620" style="s2">extremely important and if we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.260" end="00:19:39.890" style="s2">realizing how powerful this power is of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.620" end="00:19:42.740" style="s2">government and realizing the necessity</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.890" end="00:19:47.210" style="s2">to steward it from the conscious of all</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.740" end="00:19:53.090" style="s2">win then then all when aspirants are</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.210" end="00:19:56.840" style="s2">going to always be relegated to zoom</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.090" end="00:19:59.420" style="s2">calls and festivals and very small</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.840" end="00:20:03.100" style="s2">intentional communities while those who</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.420" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">pursue power will be able to wield power</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.100" end="00:20:11.090" style="s2">in service to perpetuating a win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:14.210" style="s2">world so so politics isn&#39;t government</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.090" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">and politics is definitely not vying or</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.210" end="00:20:19.330" style="s2">manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">or line like we typically think politics</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.330" end="00:20:28.090" style="s2">is the stewardship of our home</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:32.650" style="s2">politics is saying I have a vision for</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.090" end="00:20:35.680" style="s2">how our world can be better and taking</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.650" end="00:20:39.000" style="s2">action consistently and and and being</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.680" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">susceptible to rest personal harm in</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.000" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">service to fulfilling that vision of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:48.550" style="s2">better collective that we can be a part</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">of and that we can offer to our children</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.550" end="00:20:56.050" style="s2">to inherit that we leave for them and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:59.140" style="s2">so this is a political moment that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.050" end="00:21:00.610" style="s2">having starting a company is as an</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.140" end="00:21:02.620" style="s2">active politics</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.610" end="00:21:06.610" style="s2">organized and intentional community is</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.620" end="00:21:08.500" style="s2">an act of politics right in a book that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.610" end="00:21:09.910" style="s2">you believe will improve the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.500" end="00:21:14.110" style="s2">life for others as not to politics</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.910" end="00:21:16.780" style="s2">politics is this energy that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.110" end="00:21:20.050" style="s2">best world possible and so a full</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.780" end="00:21:24.870" style="s2">reclamation of politics is to connect</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.050" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">the the nobility of this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.870" end="00:21:32.770" style="s2">caring for and stuarti this tangible</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:40.660" style="s2">reality that we inhabit with each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.770" end="00:21:44.440" style="s2">and we can&#39;t fully be in our political</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.660" end="00:21:48.250" style="s2">leadership without realizing what a</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.440" end="00:21:51.190" style="s2">critical dimension of reality government</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.250" end="00:21:55.530" style="s2">is so politics and government go hand at</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.190" end="00:21:57.730" style="s2">hand because government is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.530" end="00:22:02.650" style="s2">institutional infrastructure that our</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.730" end="00:22:07.350" style="s2">ancestors passed down to us that we then</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.650" end="00:22:08.920" style="s2">now are inheriting as a way to exert our</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.920" end="00:22:14.010" style="s2">so in insane this I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.430" end="00:22:20.500" style="s2">government is good as it is or that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.800" end="00:22:23.350" style="s2">there&#39;s not profound transformations and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.500" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">what we currently call government in</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.350" end="00:22:28.450" style="s2">order to actually unlock a new era of</p>

<p begin="00:25:43.920" end="00:25:50.910" style="s2">it&#39;s this invitation to walk the path of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.890" end="00:25:53.970" style="s2">all in political religion to embody all</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.910" end="00:26:00.440" style="s2">win political culture to become a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.970" end="00:26:02.630" style="s2">paradise creator at all scales Wow</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.440" end="00:26:06.920" style="s2">well could you talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.630" end="00:26:10.850" style="s2">what what religion means in that context</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.920" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">so the way that I define religion is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.850" end="00:26:16.820" style="s2">going back to the Latin root of the word</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:20.550" style="s2">and it has several different</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.820" end="00:26:25.350" style="s2">etymological connotations and one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.550" end="00:26:28.490" style="s2">those is to bind together another of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.350" end="00:26:32.600" style="s2">those is a sense of obligation</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.490" end="00:26:37.200" style="s2">another is is a sense of care in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.600" end="00:26:40.070" style="s2">practice and another connotation is to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.200" end="00:26:42.990" style="s2">cultivate some theme through repetition</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.070" end="00:26:45.780" style="s2">these are four different Latin</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.990" end="00:26:48.330" style="s2">etymological connotations of the word</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.780" end="00:26:50.910" style="s2">religion so when I use the word religion</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.330" end="00:26:53.880" style="s2">I&#39;m referring to that which binds us</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.910" end="00:26:57.320" style="s2">together connects</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.880" end="00:27:01.560" style="s2">to a shared sense of obligation that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.320" end="00:27:06.840" style="s2">brings forward our care to embody</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.560" end="00:27:10.920" style="s2">something through rapid repeated</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.840" end="00:27:17.010" style="s2">practice so anything that does that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.920" end="00:27:18.660" style="s2">what I call religion wonderful we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.010" end="00:27:20.370" style="s2">some really great questions coming in</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.660" end="00:27:23.610" style="s2">the chat now so I think we&#39;ll move over</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.370" end="00:27:25.620" style="s2">to some of the Q&amp;A and yeah if anybody</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.680" end="00:28:56.280" style="s2">maybe we are doing it but shouldn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:57.810" style="s2">do it where every time we get together</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.280" end="00:29:00.630" style="s2">we do nothing but it&#39;s always just</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.810" end="00:29:03.150" style="s2">conversations okay we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.630" end="00:29:05.370" style="s2">listening to one person because I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.150" end="00:29:06.270" style="s2">like that there&#39;s a sort of I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.370" end="00:29:08.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.270" end="00:29:11.010" style="s2">to that format that I feel and I could</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.160" end="00:29:13.530" style="s2">be wrong about that - like I&#39;m dying for</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.010" end="00:29:15.330" style="s2">this to be nothing but conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.530" end="00:29:19.980" style="s2">then we&#39;d be actually doing the Omni in</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.870" end="00:29:56.670" style="s2">that it&#39;s important for people to</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.780" end="00:31:14.040" style="s2">you hold it for yourself and you might</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.610" end="00:31:16.680" style="s2">actually find yourself creating</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.040" end="00:31:18.900" style="s2">something totally transformational or</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.680" end="00:31:19.690" style="s2">you might find yourself circling all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.900" end="00:31:20.769" style="s2">way back and crazy</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.690" end="00:31:22.570" style="s2">very similar to this momentous</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.769" end="00:31:24.700" style="s2">experience once you experiment out</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.570" end="00:31:27.610" style="s2">yourself but it sounds like that active</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.700" end="00:31:32.879" style="s2">that that inspiration is is inviting you</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.610" end="00:31:32.879" style="s2">to create what you want to experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.210" end="00:31:43.539" style="s2">yeah great thank you and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.350" end="00:31:47.110" style="s2">engine engine would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.539" end="00:31:49.779" style="s2">question hey Christopher my question is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.110" end="00:31:51.340" style="s2">just that it&#39;s almost like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.779" end="00:31:53.320" style="s2">sometimes see what you&#39;re staying</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.340" end="00:31:54.820" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many connotates and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.320" end="00:31:57.580" style="s2">conditions and associations that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.820" end="00:32:01.419" style="s2">conjured up by words like power and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.580" end="00:32:03.639" style="s2">government and monopoly over</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.419" end="00:32:05.950" style="s2">I think people the chat brought great</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.639" end="00:32:08.440" style="s2">points that maybe that is something you</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.950" end="00:32:10.809" style="s2">just have to accept if not a firm and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.440" end="00:32:12.909" style="s2">kind of move forward if that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.809" end="00:32:16.950" style="s2">point to get to I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.909" end="00:32:19.450" style="s2">thinking about using different words or</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.950" end="00:32:21.190" style="s2">things like that that can kind of better</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.450" end="00:32:24.820" style="s2">get your point across without the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.190" end="00:32:29.379" style="s2">historical baggage yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.820" end="00:32:32.169" style="s2">something I kind of face and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.379" end="00:32:34.750" style="s2">sure what the path forward is a path</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.169" end="00:32:37.389" style="s2">that I choose although I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.750" end="00:32:38.620" style="s2">it&#39;s the most effective path with</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.389" end="00:32:39.909" style="s2">reflections like this but I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.620" end="00:32:46.980" style="s2">gonna keep choosing it because I it</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.909" end="00:32:50.740" style="s2">feels right to me is to shamelessly use</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.980" end="00:32:53.889" style="s2">terms that have this type of historical</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.740" end="00:32:56.289" style="s2">baggage in order to kind of light the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.889" end="00:32:58.509" style="s2">fire of the historical baggage</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.289" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">underneath it kind of like an alchemical</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.509" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">flame to then like burn off the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:06.700" style="s2">connotations that actually have created</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">a sense of separation from it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.700" end="00:33:17.759" style="s2">want to play in to that separation I</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">would play into people belief that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.759" end="00:33:23.590" style="s2">politics and government are inherently</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:26.230" style="s2">futile or immovable or things like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.590" end="00:33:29.019" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to play into the way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.230" end="00:33:32.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve polarized from our own sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.019" end="00:33:33.549" style="s2">power in like reflected relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.440" end="00:33:37.590" style="s2">us polarizing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.549" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">power in the world so I I kind of have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.590" end="00:33:44.379" style="s2">sick enjoyment of using terms that make</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:47.379" style="s2">people feel uncomfortable and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.379" end="00:33:50.470" style="s2">staying with them in that to notice</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.379" end="00:33:53.129" style="s2">what&#39;s actually coming up because</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.470" end="00:33:56.830" style="s2">ultimately this is about integration and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.129" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">we can&#39;t do what we want to do without</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.830" end="00:34:01.769" style="s2">integrating all these different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">ourselves in full wholeness and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.769" end="00:34:08.369" style="s2">government and politics and politicians</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:14.730" style="s2">and power and military and police and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.369" end="00:34:17.020" style="s2">bureaucracy if you believe I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.730" end="00:34:19.210" style="s2">that you do but if you do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.020" end="00:34:21.159" style="s2">we&#39;re all one and that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.210" end="00:34:22.990" style="s2">all one interconnected field and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.159" end="00:34:24.790" style="s2">we&#39;re actually our individual node of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.990" end="00:34:26.260" style="s2">consciousness is emerging from a greater</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.790" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">collective field of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.260" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">planet of which humanity is a part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:32.619" style="s2">then all these different things are you</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:34.629" style="s2">right the government is you and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.619" end="00:34:36.490" style="s2">bureaucracy is you and and the people</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.629" end="00:34:38.579" style="s2">work at the DMV are you and and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.490" end="00:34:41.109" style="s2">you and so to accept these things</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.579" end="00:34:44.889" style="s2">without trying to kind of like dance</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.109" end="00:34:47.799" style="s2">around them is to proactively embrace</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.889" end="00:34:54.760" style="s2">the parts of our greater shared</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.799" end="00:34:58.599" style="s2">collective that is us with like without</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.760" end="00:35:01.960" style="s2">any filters so that&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.599" end="00:35:04.599" style="s2">am personally really inspired to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.960" end="00:35:06.250" style="s2">continue doing I&#39;m curious if that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.599" end="00:35:07.750" style="s2">response was meaningful to you or if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.250" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">ever need to follow up thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.750" end="00:35:12.339" style="s2">topic because the question you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:15.309" style="s2">is a very good and important one yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.339" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think I have cogent thoughts but</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.309" end="00:35:18.609" style="s2">you got me thinking about a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:20.380" style="s2">if I could offer one trivial thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.609" end="00:35:23.380" style="s2">came up is it makes me think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.380" end="00:35:25.930" style="s2">incredibly important that you have time</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.380" end="00:35:27.790" style="s2">because I just realized if you only had</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.930" end="00:35:29.740" style="s2">30 seconds to talk to me or two minutes</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.790" end="00:35:31.480" style="s2">I probably just pattern match you to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.740" end="00:35:33.160" style="s2">like another politician saying cool</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.480" end="00:35:34.420" style="s2">stuff and saying about changing this and</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.160" end="00:35:37.329" style="s2">that but it&#39;s only when you have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.420" end="00:35:38.920" style="s2">chance to kind of go into it and explain</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.329" end="00:35:40.990" style="s2">yourself that I&#39;m like oh he&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.920" end="00:35:44.170" style="s2">um so I&#39;m I don&#39;t know if that matters</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.990" end="00:35:47.020" style="s2">but I came in mind yeah why is Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.170" end="00:35:48.550" style="s2">the most famous and most loved</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.020" end="00:35:54.730" style="s2">Kaster because he has actual long</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.550" end="00:35:57.790" style="s2">conversations with people and and Anya I</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.730" end="00:36:00.820" style="s2">would ask for your partnership I have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.790" end="00:36:02.110" style="s2">lot to say there&#39;s a lot coming through</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.820" end="00:36:03.610" style="s2">with one nation there&#39;s a lot coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.110" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">through the like 2020 campaign there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.610" end="00:36:06.970" style="s2">lot coming through with some these books</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">that are coming out and maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.970" end="00:36:11.980" style="s2">role of leadership that you can play to</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:14.950" style="s2">help to create that space and time for</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.980" end="00:36:16.780" style="s2">other people to be able to receive the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.950" end="00:36:18.820" style="s2">potency and transformational</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.780" end="00:36:20.980" style="s2">implications of the message that I bring</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.820" end="00:36:22.750" style="s2">forward because you might relate to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.980" end="00:36:24.670" style="s2">people and have that trust in place and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.750" end="00:36:28.710" style="s2">then can serve as some type of a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.670" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">so every single like idea that we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.710" end="00:36:36.040" style="s2">is some way a reflection of some form of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:39.070" style="s2">leadership that we can step into in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.040" end="00:36:41.530" style="s2">body so I really love to reflect back</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.070" end="00:36:43.570" style="s2">those those ideas because because</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.530" end="00:36:46.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep sense of power when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.570" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">realize some way the world could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.060" end="00:36:50.410" style="s2">better like let&#39;s just say the idea on</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">you that Christopher life has enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.410" end="00:36:54.430" style="s2">time for people to receive the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:56.470" style="s2">the profundity he&#39;s offering and to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.430" end="00:36:59.320" style="s2">perceive that and then to realize wait a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.470" end="00:37:01.030" style="s2">second I can create that reality and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.320" end="00:37:02.860" style="s2">then you go in and create that reality</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.030" end="00:37:04.660" style="s2">and then you have a greater sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.860" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">dignity and personal power that you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.660" end="00:37:10.570" style="s2">actually fill the gap between anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.850" style="s2">you perceive as how the world could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.570" end="00:37:17.010" style="s2">and the actions that you take to make</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.850" end="00:37:17.010" style="s2">the world that way</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.029" end="00:37:19.089" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.590" end="00:37:34.230" style="s2">Peter do you want to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.150" end="00:37:38.620" style="s2">Thank You Raven so let me go up or is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.230" end="00:37:42.060" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll say my memory what do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.620" end="00:37:46.090" style="s2">think about training power literacy</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.060" end="00:37:49.090" style="s2">before pursuing actual power because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.090" end="00:37:51.670" style="s2">do agree with you there&#39;s like this lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.090" end="00:37:53.620" style="s2">of communities there&#39;s a sort of felt</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.670" end="00:37:56.350" style="s2">sense and and kind of gesturing towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.620" end="00:37:57.850" style="s2">power is bad but you know in order to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.350" end="00:38:00.010" style="s2">get anything done we need to have power</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.850" end="00:38:03.580" style="s2">or at least a power to get something</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.010" end="00:38:04.930" style="s2">done but how do we not get seduced by</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.580" end="00:38:06.940" style="s2">the trappings of power or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.930" end="00:38:09.820" style="s2">pathological versions of power once we</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.940" end="00:38:11.560" style="s2">start getting more power yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.820" end="00:38:14.760" style="s2">Peter for that question and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.560" end="00:38:19.720" style="s2">exactly where all wind comes in so a</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.760" end="00:38:23.370" style="s2">commitment to all it and based upon the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.720" end="00:38:25.840" style="s2">framework around it and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.370" end="00:38:27.730" style="s2">accountability to one&#39;s self around that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.840" end="00:38:31.840" style="s2">and it being in a community practice of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.730" end="00:38:35.740" style="s2">other people and a public statement of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.840" end="00:38:38.770" style="s2">the standard of all wind leadership that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.740" end="00:38:41.230" style="s2">we who are gaining power are committed</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.770" end="00:38:42.730" style="s2">to being held accountable so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.230" end="00:38:44.410" style="s2">constantly getting feedback loops and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.730" end="00:38:46.900" style="s2">receiving the information from those</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.410" end="00:38:49.420" style="s2">feedback loops of how we can calibrate</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.900" end="00:38:51.850" style="s2">in a more refined way into that all wind</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.420" end="00:38:53.790" style="s2">way of being and again all win</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.850" end="00:38:58.510" style="s2">references the expansion of choice</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.790" end="00:39:00.490" style="s2">expanding of choice references love and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.510" end="00:39:06.370" style="s2">so what we&#39;re actually talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.490" end="00:39:10.540" style="s2">having a overt practical tangibly</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.370" end="00:39:13.030" style="s2">relevant commitment to love that then is</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.540" end="00:39:17.820" style="s2">the context and the consciousness by</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.030" end="00:39:21.610" style="s2">which we deploy our power so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.820" end="00:39:23.890" style="s2">integration of love and power that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.610" end="00:39:26.080" style="s2">you&#39;ll hear me talk about often as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.890" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">and so again that that&#39;s that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.080" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">going to be based upon the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:33.000" style="s2">which a person is holding themselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.680" end="00:39:35.400" style="s2">accountable to their own commitment of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.000" end="00:39:36.839" style="s2">however if you just fast forward several</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.400" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">years or several decades or several</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.839" end="00:39:43.140" style="s2">generations if we&#39;ve normalized love as</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">this and then love and all win kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.140" end="00:39:50.789" style="s2">become synonyms then you know buying</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:52.859" style="s2">organic food didn&#39;t used to be a thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.789" end="00:39:54.510" style="s2">until a couple decades ago and then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.859" end="00:39:56.220" style="s2">like normalize it and I&#39;ve got a stamp</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.510" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">but now everyone can buy organic food</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.220" end="00:40:03.140" style="s2">and you can add this some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:05.039" style="s2">optics into the the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.140" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">manufacturing process of the foods that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.039" end="00:40:10.849" style="s2">you eat when we normalize love and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:12.780" style="s2">create standards around it for our</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.849" end="00:40:15.000" style="s2">organizational leaders or community</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.780" end="00:40:19.799" style="s2">leaders our governmental leaders then</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.000" end="00:40:22.380" style="s2">then raising this is no normalization</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.799" end="00:40:25.859" style="s2">accountability around love that then we</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.380" end="00:40:28.230" style="s2">check power it gets and I I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.859" end="00:40:31.170" style="s2">that we could create a future scenario</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.230" end="00:40:34.049" style="s2">where love and power are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.170" end="00:40:37.200" style="s2">integrated and the mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.049" end="00:40:40.369" style="s2">civilization prevent people from</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.200" end="00:40:43.410" style="s2">accessing increased levels of power if</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.369" end="00:40:46.279" style="s2">they haven&#39;t manifested a consistent</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.410" end="00:40:49.260" style="s2">embodiment of increased levels of love</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.279" end="00:40:51.329" style="s2">and a follow-up question I really like</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.260" end="00:40:53.130" style="s2">that like tethering this pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.329" end="00:40:55.799" style="s2">power with love so they&#39;re sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.130" end="00:40:56.940" style="s2">it&#39;s anchored by it and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.799" end="00:40:58.650" style="s2">turn by even if I&#39;m pronouncing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.940" end="00:41:00.690" style="s2">right path ah cracy about the people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.650" end="00:41:03.240" style="s2">currently get power or sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.690" end="00:41:04.829" style="s2">Psychopaths all the type of stuff so it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.240" end="00:41:07.980" style="s2">selects for it and that&#39;s the power</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.829" end="00:41:08.970" style="s2">that&#39;s not anchored in love yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.980" end="00:41:10.890" style="s2">when you now it&#39;s like hey we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.970" end="00:41:13.230" style="s2">to get some power and then how do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.890" end="00:41:18.510" style="s2">not get on these people&#39;s radars so they</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.230" end="00:41:27.210" style="s2">just squash it like a bug I think you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.510" end="00:41:31.250" style="s2">have to build a true prolific embodied</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.210" end="00:41:36.029" style="s2">social movement that can withstand the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.250" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">attempts of squashing this moment these</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.029" end="00:41:42.930" style="s2">relationships let&#39;s say I gain a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.640" end="00:41:44.940" style="s2">bit of power and that what there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.930" end="00:41:45.450" style="s2">stages of squashing right the first was</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.940" end="00:41:49.230" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.450" end="00:41:52.020" style="s2">slander and defamation and you know lies</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.230" end="00:41:54.030" style="s2">and stuff like that so if tomorrow a</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.020" end="00:41:57.020" style="s2">whole bunch if I a whole bunch stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.030" end="00:42:01.050" style="s2">comes out about a bunch of misconduct</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.020" end="00:42:04.530" style="s2">that that I&#39;ve been you know accused of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.050" end="00:42:06.359" style="s2">that you don&#39;t feel matches the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.530" end="00:42:08.550" style="s2">experience that we had and that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.359" end="00:42:10.650" style="s2">willing to investigate if that&#39;s true or</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.550" end="00:42:13.800" style="s2">not rather than just accepted through</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.650" end="00:42:16.820" style="s2">poor sense making in capacities then</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.800" end="00:42:22.560" style="s2">then that moment Peter were you you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.820" end="00:42:25.800" style="s2">questioned if that news bulletin was</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.560" end="00:42:27.900" style="s2">true would be a manifestation that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.800" end="00:42:30.150" style="s2">sidestep some of the squashing effect</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.900" end="00:42:31.380" style="s2">because of the of the community the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.150" end="00:42:33.170" style="s2">relationships and social mood that were</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.380" end="00:42:37.349" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.170" end="00:42:39.630" style="s2">well thank you excellent and I wanna I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.349" end="00:42:42.420" style="s2">want to get to maybe&#39;s thoughts and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.630" end="00:42:47.550" style="s2">back to Jacob so maybe would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.420" end="00:42:49.829" style="s2">unmute yourself ask a question uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.550" end="00:42:51.900" style="s2">my question was just about like I am</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.829" end="00:42:54.740" style="s2">really sympathetic to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.900" end="00:42:57.660" style="s2">there&#39;s like a huge power structure and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.740" end="00:42:59.430" style="s2">ignoring it is not going to like amount</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.660" end="00:43:00.569" style="s2">to the same thing as reclaiming that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.430" end="00:43:03.300" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.569" end="00:43:04.530" style="s2">I&#39;m just wondering how you intend to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.300" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">something different</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.530" end="00:43:08.339" style="s2">once you&#39;ve reclaims the power so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:10.530" style="s2">we don&#39;t run into the same pitfalls and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.339" end="00:43:13.530" style="s2">those like well-worn paths of corruption</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.530" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">that seem to happen when big revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.530" end="00:43:19.530" style="s2">are like quote unquote successful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:22.380" style="s2">at the at the structural</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.530" end="00:43:24.240" style="s2">transformational level or at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.380" end="00:43:26.730" style="s2">transformation of our political</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.240" end="00:43:30.270" style="s2">structures that that provides the answer</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.730" end="00:43:33.540" style="s2">to your question we have a set of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.270" end="00:43:38.390" style="s2">platform of how to upgrade our democracy</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.540" end="00:43:43.500" style="s2">that makes our democracy less accessible</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.390" end="00:43:46.230" style="s2">to abuse of power so there&#39;s a profound</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.500" end="00:43:49.670" style="s2">increase of transparency which that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.230" end="00:43:52.109" style="s2">alone just eliminates the ability for</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.670" end="00:43:55.470" style="s2">public office to be used for abuse of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.109" end="00:43:57.660" style="s2">power to a substantial degree we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.470" end="00:43:59.589" style="s2">talking about transformation of sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.660" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">making processes</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.589" end="00:44:06.250" style="s2">how decision-making is transformed from</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:09.220" style="s2">from the vote to the conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.250" end="00:44:12.369" style="s2">so the vote is basically like a form of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.220" end="00:44:13.569" style="s2">warfare that&#39;s nonviolent so I get votes</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.369" end="00:44:16.180" style="s2">and you get votes and whoever gets the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.569" end="00:44:22.240" style="s2">most votes wins whether it&#39;s a policy</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.180" end="00:44:24.549" style="s2">issue or an electoral issue D of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.240" end="00:44:28.390" style="s2">democracy is the conversation and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.549" end="00:44:33.130" style="s2">experiment not the propaganda and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:35.470" style="s2">vote well I just get frozen there we go</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.130" end="00:44:40.839" style="s2">they got froze for a second so that new</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.470" end="00:44:43.329" style="s2">currency of a politics is doesn&#39;t allow</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.599" end="00:45:24.630" style="s2">participating in our republic are</p>

<p begin="00:45:51.540" end="00:46:01.150" style="s2">then we are completely screwed there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:46:23.960" end="00:46:27.979" style="s2">that I don&#39;t prefer happens on my watch</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.119" end="00:46:30.170" style="s2">and I&#39;m responsible for that and I will</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.979" end="00:46:32.660" style="s2">take action around that until we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.170" end="00:46:34.789" style="s2">to get there in our hearts and our minds</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.660" end="00:46:37.819" style="s2">in our embodiment all of our systems</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.789" end="00:46:40.609" style="s2">will still be able to be manipulated I</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.819" end="00:46:42.710" style="s2">could get into office and change 30</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.609" end="00:46:44.599" style="s2">different laws and policies that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.710" end="00:46:48.019" style="s2">transform and upgrade our democratic</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.599" end="00:46:50.650" style="s2">systems but if those aren&#39;t maintained</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.019" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">by this Renaissance of civic engagement</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.650" end="00:46:56.180" style="s2">then they&#39;ll be futile and they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:57.529" style="s2">undone so ultimately this comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.180" end="00:46:59.690" style="s2">the cultural movement this comes back</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.529" end="00:47:02.269" style="s2">the social movement we have to realize</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.690" end="00:47:06.009" style="s2">that by letting our hands off of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.269" end="00:47:10.359" style="s2">wheel we have created a win-lose world</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.009" end="00:47:13.759" style="s2">with piles of carnage that should be</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.359" end="00:47:16.549" style="s2">unbearable for us to actually comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.759" end="00:47:19.660" style="s2">and that the only way that we get not</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.549" end="00:47:22.500" style="s2">that is by a higher level of political</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.660" end="00:47:27.000" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.500" end="00:47:31.740" style="s2">I accidentally ders yeah as our leaders</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.000" end="00:47:33.570" style="s2">- to use our platform of leadership to</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.740" end="00:47:35.870" style="s2">challenge people to rise in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.570" end="00:47:38.520" style="s2">responsibility as opposed to</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.300" end="00:47:49.110" style="s2">accountable do this do that do that like</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.070" end="00:47:51.780" style="s2">that&#39;s like the greatest act of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.110" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">achieving that world is for our leaders</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.780" end="00:47:55.170" style="s2">to demand a higher level of</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:05.350" style="s2">excellent thanks for that question may</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.900" end="00:48:07.330" style="s2">be and so I think we&#39;re gonna bring in</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.350" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">our last question here Jacob would you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.330" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">like to share your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.230" end="00:48:20.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve sit so much I feel like I know they</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.440" end="00:48:23.700" style="s2">actually continue in voice here but so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.490" end="00:48:26.460" style="s2">think the big my big my whopper I guess</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.700" end="00:48:30.359" style="s2">is sort of is this hominy win win</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.460" end="00:48:33.900" style="s2">ideology stuff just like the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.359" end="00:48:35.250" style="s2">advanced form of equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.900" end="00:48:38.940" style="s2">which I&#39;m assuming most of us aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.250" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">fans of right because it&#39;s homogenizing</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.940" end="00:48:45.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s ultimately like just destroys</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:47.010" style="s2">life right the quality of outcome stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.480" end="00:48:50.099" style="s2">and it just seems like this is just that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.010" end="00:48:53.220" style="s2">and I like saying it&#39;s that on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.099" end="00:48:55.410" style="s2">sports drink for some reason that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.220" end="00:48:56.910" style="s2">funny but so let&#39;s see how that&#39;s is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.410" end="00:49:00.390" style="s2">worth asking that question isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.910" end="00:49:02.040" style="s2">question when you say quality outcome</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.390" end="00:49:03.330" style="s2">can you just open that up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.040" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">I&#39;m not familiar that is a technical</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.330" end="00:49:07.050" style="s2">term come on well I guess I can just</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:08.730" style="s2">refer to like I guess for most people</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.050" end="00:49:10.140" style="s2">just think maybe just refer to JP cuz</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.730" end="00:49:11.940" style="s2">he&#39;s you know Jordan Peterson he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.140" end="00:49:16.050" style="s2">one it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of expressed it the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.940" end="00:49:19.800" style="s2">best right like arguably and so call you</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.050" end="00:49:23.130" style="s2">out come this equity idea that we all</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.800" end="00:49:25.020" style="s2">have a sort of oh man like don&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.130" end="00:49:26.310" style="s2">such a big question to ask you can I</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.020" end="00:49:30.750" style="s2">don&#39;t think you can turn the table that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.310" end="00:49:32.430" style="s2">widely on me can someone else maybe give</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.750" end="00:49:33.900" style="s2">them a short version of equality of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.430" end="00:49:34.740" style="s2">outcome I feel I can I do it in under</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.900" end="00:49:37.830" style="s2">five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.740" end="00:49:39.740" style="s2">I&#39;ll find bridge I mean equality of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.830" end="00:49:42.420" style="s2">outcome is the idea that we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.740" end="00:49:44.880" style="s2">obligated with our civic and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.420" end="00:49:47.700" style="s2">governmental structure to assure an</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.880" end="00:49:49.410" style="s2">equal come for each citizen that they</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.700" end="00:49:51.960" style="s2">have an equal set of living they have</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.410" end="00:49:54.300" style="s2">equal money etc sort of access to all</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.960" end="00:49:57.180" style="s2">things equally and that&#39;s a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.300" end="00:49:58.920" style="s2">flawed idea for many people because that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.180" end="00:50:01.980" style="s2">you can never you can never guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.920" end="00:50:03.750" style="s2">that and it tends to require use of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.980" end="00:50:06.150" style="s2">power that actually squash this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.750" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">difference that also this allows people</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.150" end="00:50:09.720" style="s2">who are expressing their different</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.440" end="00:50:11.880" style="s2">valuation of what they really care about</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.720" end="00:50:14.190" style="s2">in life and then there&#39;s the other which</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.880" end="00:50:16.050" style="s2">is equality of opportunity and so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.190" end="00:50:17.700" style="s2">think what Jacob is asking about is</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.050" end="00:50:22.220" style="s2">whether what you are talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.700" end="00:50:24.810" style="s2">Omni then is a sort of souped-up higher</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.220" end="00:50:28.110" style="s2">fidelity or sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.810" end="00:50:30.840" style="s2">concepts version of equality about does</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.110" end="00:50:33.240" style="s2">that do you justice Jacob yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.840" end="00:50:36.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a big part of it a big part of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.240" end="00:50:40.620" style="s2">but it&#39;s also has a lot to do with what</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.840" end="00:50:43.740" style="s2">we what how we decide what competence is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.620" end="00:50:45.420" style="s2">right because if you have ten people in</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.740" end="00:50:47.670" style="s2">your cabinet right let&#39;s say in five of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.420" end="00:50:50.430" style="s2">them are female and five or more male</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.670" end="00:50:51.900" style="s2">than you are saying that&#39;s the that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.430" end="00:50:54.690" style="s2">good scenario but you haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.900" end="00:50:56.550" style="s2">measured the the ability of those</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.690" end="00:50:58.650" style="s2">individuals based on any real competence</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.550" end="00:50:59.850" style="s2">just on their gender in that case okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.650" end="00:51:01.170" style="s2">so that&#39;s it that&#39;s a big part of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.850" end="00:51:02.940" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s a really big it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.170" end="00:51:05.310" style="s2">really big definition actually it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.940" end="00:51:08.010" style="s2">we you&#39;d handled a big part of it really</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.310" end="00:51:10.050" style="s2">well so yeah let me jump off real quick</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.010" end="00:51:12.390" style="s2">to finish this with Lachlan and Maurice</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.050" end="00:51:17.820" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna use your definition as my jump</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.390" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">off point I think based upon that</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.820" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">definition that Alwyn is the integral</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.100" end="00:51:35.400" style="s2">um and quality of opportunity because</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.070" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">winning itself is contextualized by the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.400" end="00:51:38.940" style="s2">choices that a person wants to have</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:41.250" style="s2">available to them that aren&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.940" end="00:51:45.230" style="s2">available to them so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.250" end="00:51:47.820" style="s2">recalibration of that outcome</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.230" end="00:51:49.470" style="s2">contextualized by an individual&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.820" end="00:51:52.710" style="s2">aspiration and that&#39;s what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.470" end="00:51:58.620" style="s2">winning for them and so what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.710" end="00:52:00.780" style="s2">do is we want to create a context of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.620" end="00:52:05.460" style="s2">consciousness and of our political</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.780" end="00:52:06.900" style="s2">systems that is not because because the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.460" end="00:52:09.420" style="s2">quality of opportunity I think without</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.900" end="00:52:10.980" style="s2">the quality of outcome thing is probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.420" end="00:52:13.140" style="s2">and again I haven&#39;t studied this body of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.980" end="00:52:14.550" style="s2">work but I&#39;m guessing that the argument</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.140" end="00:52:17.430" style="s2">of the shadow side is that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.550" end="00:52:19.230" style="s2">points to maybe our current capitalistic</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.430" end="00:52:22.470" style="s2">systems and how that quality of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.230" end="00:52:27.950" style="s2">opportunity can potentially be abused</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.470" end="00:52:30.570" style="s2">and and lead to people not having shared</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.950" end="00:52:32.630" style="s2">results because maybe you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.570" end="00:52:35.010" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s power dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.630" end="00:52:37.140" style="s2">enable people to abuse that quality of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.010" end="00:52:41.940" style="s2">opportunity so if you bring that</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.140" end="00:52:47.940" style="s2">together then you want everyone to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.940" end="00:52:50.940" style="s2">able to want everyone else to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.940" end="00:52:53.250" style="s2">win according to their own definition of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.940" end="00:52:56.100" style="s2">winning and while that may sound</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.250" end="00:52:59.340" style="s2">idealistic I actually believe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.100" end="00:53:02.010" style="s2">what paradise is paradise is an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.340" end="00:53:03.930" style="s2">experience of everyone else wanting</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.010" end="00:53:06.150" style="s2">everyone else to expand their choice</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.930" end="00:53:10.100" style="s2">based upon the choices that they want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.150" end="00:53:12.500" style="s2">have the ability to have access to so</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.100" end="00:53:17.690" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that we&#39;re in the zone of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.500" end="00:53:20.870" style="s2">integrating the outcome and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.690" end="00:53:20.870" style="s2">opportunity piece</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:31.720" style="s2">great Thank You Christopher I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.090" end="00:53:33.850" style="s2">invite you to share any final words or</p>

<p begin="00:54:49.270" end="00:54:54.850" style="s2">you know leadership capacities in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.850" end="00:54:57.160" style="s2">moment so having a field of thousands of</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.950" end="00:55:47.030" style="s2">and then so you became just heartened</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.300" end="00:55:48.530" style="s2">and you came like a alienated and jaded</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.030" end="00:55:49.910" style="s2">and realized I&#39;ll never do that again</p>

<p begin="00:55:54.560" end="00:55:58.130" style="s2">like well where do I go from here well</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.570" end="00:56:00.410" style="s2">you you register as a member of one</p>
