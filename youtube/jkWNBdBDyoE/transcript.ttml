<p begin="00:00:58.840" end="00:01:03.010" style="s2">we began our exploration of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.340" end="00:01:05.619" style="s2">we first looked at what it meant sati</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.010" end="00:01:07.660" style="s2">and remember it&#39;s this deep remembering</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.590" end="00:01:24.760" style="s2">for us and then we started to take a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:26.950" style="s2">look at that the practice of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.760" end="00:01:29.049" style="s2">and its attempt to address at least an</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.700" end="00:01:42.430" style="s2">and how that is response to the meaning</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:52.720" style="s2">misleading in some ways the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.110" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">study because it begins with a feature</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.720" end="00:01:57.790" style="s2">list and as we&#39;ve noted multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.799" style="s2">feature lists leave out the I das the</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.799" end="00:02:05.259" style="s2">order to do that we brought out four</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.130" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">sort of central characteristics in the</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.940" end="00:02:17.260" style="s2">an increased equanimity and then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.130" end="00:02:18.840" style="s2">noted that what we need to do is to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.260" end="00:02:21.489" style="s2">distinctions between the types of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.840" end="00:02:23.709" style="s2">features between those that are states</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.489" end="00:02:26.709" style="s2">that we can engage in actions we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.709" end="00:02:27.610" style="s2">perform and traits we can cultivate once</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.709" end="00:02:29.290" style="s2">we did</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.610" end="00:02:31.690" style="s2">we opened up the possibility of asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.290" end="00:02:33.250" style="s2">causal questions how can the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.690" end="00:02:36.490" style="s2">being present for example produce the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.250" end="00:02:39.880" style="s2">trait of insightfulness and then we also</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.490" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">could ask constitutive questions what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.880" end="00:02:43.210" style="s2">the relationship the part-whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:48.250" style="s2">relationship for example between being</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.210" end="00:02:51.910" style="s2">present and and not judging that being</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.250" end="00:02:54.130" style="s2">said we then also noted that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.910" end="00:02:55.990" style="s2">replace the language of training with</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.130" end="00:02:57.430" style="s2">the language of explaining they operate</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.990" end="00:03:00.550" style="s2">according to different principles and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.430" end="00:03:03.400" style="s2">for different goals and we began that by</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.550" end="00:03:05.520" style="s2">starting to ask what does it mean to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.400" end="00:03:07.810" style="s2">present and then we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.520" end="00:03:09.790" style="s2">concentration and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.810" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">different senses of that and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.790" end="00:03:15.370" style="s2">soft vigilance that&#39;s actually conducive</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:20.230" style="s2">of insight discussed by Allen Langer and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.370" end="00:03:23.530" style="s2">others this kind of involvement is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.230" end="00:03:28.150" style="s2">much about conforming to be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.530" end="00:03:29.980" style="s2">deeply interested connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.150" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">structural functional organization of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.980" end="00:03:36.520" style="s2">something we noted that that took us</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:39.190" style="s2">into a discussion of paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.520" end="00:03:41.380" style="s2">and all the while remembering this idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.190" end="00:03:44.140" style="s2">that we got from sitar ticket to Tama</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.380" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">the story about tuning getting the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.140" end="00:03:50.020" style="s2">tuning optimization and we started to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:52.870" style="s2">talk about attention and I made the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.020" end="00:03:55.090" style="s2">argument that attention is not very well</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.870" end="00:03:57.910" style="s2">served by the spotlight metaphor well</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.090" end="00:04:00.489" style="s2">while that metaphor does give us the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.910" end="00:04:02.470" style="s2">idea of attention altering salience the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.489" end="00:04:04.390" style="s2">metaphor misses a lot of what attention</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.470" end="00:04:06.610" style="s2">is doing we began to investigate what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.390" end="00:04:09.010" style="s2">missing by making use of Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.610" end="00:04:11.620" style="s2">malls idea that attention is not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.010" end="00:04:13.030" style="s2">direct action you perform by walking but</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.620" end="00:04:14.920" style="s2">it&#39;s something you do by modifying</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.030" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">something else by optimizing something</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.920" end="00:04:19.180" style="s2">else that&#39;s why you can successfully pay</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:20.890" style="s2">attention by doing many disparate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.180" end="00:04:23.230" style="s2">different kinds of things you can pay</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.890" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">attention by optimizing your seeing into</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.230" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">looking by optimizing your hearing into</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">listening by optimizing your seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:32.950" style="s2">listening into a coordinated tracking of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.110" style="s2">some what somebody is saying like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.950" end="00:04:37.060" style="s2">doing right now all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.110" end="00:04:39.100" style="s2">different ways in which we&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.060" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">attention so what we needed was an</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.100" end="00:04:44.480" style="s2">understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:47.060" style="s2">tension that could capture the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.480" end="00:04:49.250" style="s2">an optimization strategy which lines up</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.060" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">with this tuning idea and how such</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.250" end="00:04:56.750" style="s2">optimization might be linked to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:58.910" style="s2">response to existential modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.750" end="00:05:01.370" style="s2">and the alleviation of the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.910" end="00:05:04.990" style="s2">found therein so I want to continue that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.370" end="00:05:08.210" style="s2">discussion about attention and start to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.990" end="00:05:10.460" style="s2">point towards what might be going on if</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.210" end="00:05:12.410" style="s2">you remember mol talks about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.460" end="00:05:16.060" style="s2">of cognitive unison getting a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.410" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">processes to share a goal to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.060" end="00:05:21.110" style="s2">coordinated together in some fashion now</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:23.270" style="s2">he leaves it abstract like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.110" end="00:05:24.410" style="s2">think we should try and investigate a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.270" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">little bit more further and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.410" end="00:05:27.470" style="s2">concretely</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:29.390" style="s2">what that might mean and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:31.370" style="s2">of attention is one of the hottest areas</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.390" end="00:05:34.580" style="s2">in cognitive science right now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.370" end="00:05:37.640" style="s2">lot of good work done by frank woo by</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.580" end="00:05:39.530" style="s2">special watts all Christopher Moore just</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.640" end="00:05:42.050" style="s2">many people are talking about this and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.530" end="00:05:45.169" style="s2">I&#39;m not pretending to canvass all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.050" end="00:05:47.930" style="s2">that rich and very fertile and and very</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.169" end="00:05:50.540" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s very creative its</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.540" end="00:05:54.680" style="s2">trying to pick up on some key themes</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.070" end="00:05:58.460" style="s2">here because what we want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.680" end="00:06:01.669" style="s2">is how can mindfulness training so as to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.460" end="00:06:04.370" style="s2">cause more insight to make one more</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.669" end="00:06:06.380" style="s2">disposition aliy capable of insight</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.370" end="00:06:08.660" style="s2">because all after all and we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.380" end="00:06:09.590" style="s2">about this before we&#39;re not talking when</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:26.419" style="s2">existential mode so let&#39;s talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:30.669" style="s2">bit more again about what&#39;s missing from</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.419" end="00:06:34.330" style="s2">the model of attention so this cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.669" end="00:06:37.550" style="s2">unison I think we can make use of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.330" end="00:06:39.229" style="s2">another important cognitive scientist</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.229" end="00:06:46.580" style="s2">attention and that&#39;s Michael Polanyi and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.200" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">he pointed out that attention has an</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.220" end="00:07:05.030" style="s2">experiment with you and it&#39;s experiment</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.780" end="00:07:07.340" style="s2">you can sort of follow along with me so</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.030" end="00:07:09.380" style="s2">let me describe it to you first I need</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.340" end="00:07:11.600" style="s2">you to get some object like a pencil or</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.380" end="00:07:15.410" style="s2">a pen and we will call that your your</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.600" end="00:07:16.370" style="s2">probe nothing untoward is meant by that</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.410" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">that&#39;s just what it&#39;s called in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.370" end="00:07:21.380" style="s2">psychology and it doesn&#39;t involve any</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:23.030" style="s2">alien doing graphic things to your body</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:24.650" style="s2">or anything like that so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.030" end="00:07:27.170" style="s2">gonna do is let me describe it to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.650" end="00:07:29.000" style="s2">first okay it&#39;s what I&#39;m going to ask</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.170" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">you to do it&#39;s gonna ask you to find</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.000" end="00:07:32.300" style="s2">some object that you could put it on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:34.130" style="s2">desk in front of you or hold in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.300" end="00:07:35.990" style="s2">hand and then you&#39;re gonna do the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.130" end="00:07:37.460" style="s2">following do not start yet because I</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.990" end="00:07:39.650" style="s2">want to describe it to you I&#39;m going I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.460" end="00:07:42.830" style="s2">going to ask you to tap on the object as</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.650" end="00:07:45.170" style="s2">if you were blind and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:47.920" style="s2">figure out what the object is its shape</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.170" end="00:07:50.930" style="s2">its structure its weight its density oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.920" end="00:07:52.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a cup right that that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.930" end="00:07:53.300" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.010" end="00:07:54.410" style="s2">it&#39;s important well you know you should</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.300" end="00:07:56.120" style="s2">close your eyes you&#39;re doing this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.410" end="00:07:58.730" style="s2">using touch because touch is slower than</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.120" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">sight and so you can become more aware</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.730" end="00:08:04.910" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening now it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:07.490" style="s2">while you do this that you continue</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.910" end="00:08:09.230" style="s2">tapping so I&#39;m gonna ask you in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:10.460" style="s2">to close your eyes start the tapping and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.230" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">then while you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:14.990" style="s2">continue the tapping as you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:17.180" style="s2">following my instructions and this will</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.990" end="00:08:18.920" style="s2">give you a sense of what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.180" end="00:08:20.390" style="s2">okay so what I want you to do is close</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.920" end="00:08:24.020" style="s2">your eyes that you start tapping on your</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.390" end="00:08:26.150" style="s2">object right start tapping until you</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.020" end="00:08:28.730" style="s2">start to form an image of the object in</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.150" end="00:08:30.020" style="s2">your mind okay so your eyes are closed</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.730" end="00:08:31.820" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to get an image of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.020" end="00:08:33.710" style="s2">that object is in your mind okay so</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.820" end="00:08:35.210" style="s2">right now you&#39;re aware like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.710" end="00:08:37.250" style="s2">focally aware what&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.210" end="00:08:39.290" style="s2">focusing your awareness on is the object</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.250" end="00:08:40.580" style="s2">I want you to keep tapping but I want</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.290" end="00:08:42.530" style="s2">you to shift your awareness into your</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.580" end="00:08:45.800" style="s2">probe feel how your pencil or your pen</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.530" end="00:08:48.230" style="s2">is moving around shifting okay keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.800" end="00:08:51.020" style="s2">topping and then I want you to shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.230" end="00:08:52.700" style="s2">your awareness into your fingers and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.020" end="00:08:55.880" style="s2">feel how your fingers are moving around</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.700" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">shifting around okay some of you may be</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.880" end="00:08:59.330" style="s2">able to pick up on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:02.630" style="s2">feelings that are occurring in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.330" end="00:09:05.510" style="s2">fingers now go back feel your fingers</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.630" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">and your thumb how they&#39;re moving now</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.510" end="00:09:11.160" style="s2">feel how the probe is moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:13.560" style="s2">and now allow the tapping to reveal the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.160" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">object to you once again so I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.560" end="00:09:18.029" style="s2">this multiple multiple times with people</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:20.100" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is the following</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.029" end="00:09:23.490" style="s2">thing most people find this very readily</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.100" end="00:09:25.320" style="s2">easy to do and a couple things when</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.490" end="00:09:27.570" style="s2">you&#39;re initially tapping for example I</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.320" end="00:09:30.269" style="s2">was aware of my cop but then my</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.570" end="00:09:31.800" style="s2">awareness moves into my marker and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.269" end="00:09:33.240" style="s2">my awareness moves into my finger and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.800" end="00:09:37.170" style="s2">when my awareness is in my finger I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.240" end="00:09:38.880" style="s2">not aware of the cop at all that I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.170" end="00:09:41.339" style="s2">able to reverse it I go from being aware</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.880" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">of my fingers to being aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.339" end="00:09:45.870" style="s2">probe to being aware of the cup using</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:47.730" style="s2">what&#39;s all this about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.870" end="00:09:49.890" style="s2">well there&#39;s an important structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.730" end="00:09:52.079" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look at it step by step so</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.890" end="00:09:54.390" style="s2">here&#39;s the cup or whatever your object</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.079" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">was right and I&#39;m tapping on it with my</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">probe okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">now here&#39;s the interesting thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:04.920" style="s2">not like I was completely unaware of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:07.709" style="s2">probe because I was completely unaware</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.920" end="00:10:09.570" style="s2">of that I couldn&#39;t manipulate it but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.709" end="00:10:11.970" style="s2">wasn&#39;t actually aware of it I was aware</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.570" end="00:10:19.339" style="s2">through it I was aware through my probe</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.970" end="00:10:22.770" style="s2">of the cop so I&#39;m aware through this and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.339" end="00:10:24.600" style="s2">I&#39;m aware of this so it&#39;s like my probe</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.770" end="00:10:27.540" style="s2">is transparent to me and okay let me</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.600" end="00:10:35.010" style="s2">give you an analogy right now where this</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.540" end="00:10:36.180" style="s2">is opaque right here&#39;s the analogy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.010" end="00:10:37.709" style="s2">think about and we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.180" end="00:10:39.779" style="s2">before but let&#39;s do it again and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.709" end="00:10:42.510" style="s2">just like my glasses are like my framing</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.779" end="00:10:44.670" style="s2">right my glasses are transparent to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.510" end="00:10:47.970" style="s2">in the sense that I&#39;m looking through</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.670" end="00:10:49.649" style="s2">them beyond them by means of them to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.970" end="00:10:52.890" style="s2">transparent to me but what I can do is I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.649" end="00:10:55.800" style="s2">can redirect my awareness so that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.890" end="00:10:57.449" style="s2">now looking at my glasses rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.800" end="00:11:00.050" style="s2">through them so my glasses have now</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.449" end="00:11:06.449" style="s2">become opaque to me so I can do a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:11.250" style="s2">transparency to opacity shift now what</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.449" end="00:11:13.459" style="s2">does that ability to shift indicate well</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.250" end="00:11:16.140" style="s2">this is this is part of polanyi&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.459" end="00:11:18.360" style="s2">here&#39;s my probe I&#39;m aware through my</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.140" end="00:11:21.980" style="s2">probe he has what I call a subsidiary or</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.360" end="00:11:21.980" style="s2">an implicit awareness</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:32.280" style="s2">because I&#39;m aware through it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.730" end="00:11:35.820" style="s2">aware of it I&#39;m aware through it right</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.280" end="00:11:41.430" style="s2">of my focal object for example my cup</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.820" end="00:11:46.350" style="s2">and this I have a focal awareness or an</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.430" end="00:11:48.780" style="s2">explicit awareness now here&#39;s a point</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.350" end="00:11:50.700" style="s2">which is really quite good right is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.780" end="00:11:53.250" style="s2">attention is this kind of structuring</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.700" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">phenomena what it is it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.250" end="00:11:57.720" style="s2">attention as he says from - it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:12:00.180" style="s2">attention through subsidiary awareness</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.720" end="00:12:02.940" style="s2">into focal awareness when I&#39;m paying</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.180" end="00:12:05.130" style="s2">attention I&#39;m doing this but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.940" end="00:12:08.670" style="s2">interesting thing I was then able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.130" end="00:12:13.170" style="s2">step back and make this focal right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.670" end="00:12:15.930" style="s2">now it&#39;s my fingers that I am aware I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.170" end="00:12:17.790" style="s2">aware through my fingers of my probe and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.930" end="00:12:21.240" style="s2">then I can even step back and be aware</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.790" end="00:12:25.110" style="s2">of my feet of my feelings what some</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.240" end="00:12:27.180" style="s2">people would call sensations so I can I</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.110" end="00:12:30.960" style="s2">can keep stepping back and stepping back</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.180" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">so I&#39;m looking at the cup through my</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.960" end="00:12:36.510" style="s2">probe now I&#39;m looking through my fingers</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:39.030" style="s2">the probe and now I&#39;m looking through my</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.510" end="00:12:40.440" style="s2">feelings my fingers and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.030" end="00:12:42.180" style="s2">whole time I was actually looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.440" end="00:12:44.580" style="s2">cup I was doing all of that I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.180" end="00:12:48.110" style="s2">looking through my feelings through my</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.580" end="00:12:50.280" style="s2">fingers through my probe into the cup</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.110" end="00:12:54.500" style="s2">you see the spotlight metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.280" end="00:12:58.170" style="s2">missing all of that layered recursive</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.500" end="00:12:59.490" style="s2">dynamic structuring that&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.170" end="00:13:02.040" style="s2">notice you can move in both directions</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.490" end="00:13:04.500" style="s2">you can do a transparency opacity shift</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.040" end="00:13:07.110" style="s2">in which I step back more and more into</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.500" end="00:13:10.260" style="s2">my mind or I can go the opposite way</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.110" end="00:13:13.560" style="s2">I can do an opacity to transparency</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.260" end="00:13:15.770" style="s2">shift that&#39;s when you went the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.560" end="00:13:18.420" style="s2">way that&#39;s when you go from looking at</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.770" end="00:13:21.090" style="s2">your fingers to looking through your</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.420" end="00:13:22.710" style="s2">fingers your probe and going from</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.090" end="00:13:25.380" style="s2">looking at your probe to looking through</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.710" end="00:13:27.840" style="s2">your probe to the cup and your attention</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.380" end="00:13:30.090" style="s2">is doing that all the time flowing in</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.840" end="00:13:33.840" style="s2">and out doing a transparency and opacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.090" end="00:13:36.120" style="s2">shifting now</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.840" end="00:13:38.580" style="s2">that&#39;s very important because that&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.430" end="00:15:08.070" style="s2">the point about this and we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.600" end="00:15:09.870" style="s2">about this before of course is this also</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.070" end="00:15:11.820" style="s2">works not which is technology with Syco</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.870" end="00:15:13.470" style="s2">technologies we talked about this with</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.820" end="00:15:15.780" style="s2">second-order thinking you can so</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.470" end="00:15:17.580" style="s2">integrate literacy for example into your</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.580" end="00:15:24.530" style="s2">literacy very much you automatically</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.380" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">look through it I will come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.530" end="00:15:30.630" style="s2">all right so this is right as I said</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:33.720" style="s2">this seems to be people talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.630" end="00:15:36.029" style="s2">metaphorically as moving in and out with</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.720" end="00:15:38.130" style="s2">their awareness so one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.029" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">attentions work is it moves in and out</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.130" end="00:15:43.380" style="s2">you can right look through a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:45.540" style="s2">processing deeply out into the world or</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.380" end="00:15:46.899" style="s2">you can step back and look at a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.540" end="00:15:49.379" style="s2">processing and with</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.899" end="00:15:52.779" style="s2">draw towards the center of your mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.379" end="00:15:55.209" style="s2">there&#39;s another important access upon</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.779" end="00:15:59.309" style="s2">which your attention is working and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.209" end="00:15:59.309" style="s2">can bring it out by a famous example</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.579" end="00:16:06.670" style="s2">right so you give this to people and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.449" end="00:16:08.679" style="s2">ask them to read it and they say what</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.670" end="00:16:09.999" style="s2">does it say and they&#39;ll say the cat and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.679" end="00:16:11.949" style="s2">there and they&#39;re like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.999" end="00:16:13.959" style="s2">right and then you point out to them</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.949" end="00:16:16.029" style="s2">that they&#39;re reading this as an H and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.959" end="00:16:18.730" style="s2">they&#39;re reading this as an A and these</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.029" end="00:16:20.709" style="s2">are exactly the same thing why are you</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.730" end="00:16:22.749" style="s2">reading once one is an H and the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.709" end="00:16:25.809" style="s2">is an A and so what they&#39;ll typically</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.749" end="00:16:28.179" style="s2">say to you is well because it fits in</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.809" end="00:16:30.999" style="s2">with this word as an H and it fits in</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.179" end="00:16:32.379" style="s2">with this word as an A so let&#39;s use</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.999" end="00:16:34.749" style="s2">language we&#39;ve already developed the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.379" end="00:16:36.970" style="s2">letters are the features and the word is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.749" end="00:16:40.209" style="s2">the gestalt the overall structure now</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.970" end="00:16:43.119" style="s2">notice here you&#39;ve got a problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.209" end="00:16:46.869" style="s2">almost you know a pseudo Zen problem in</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.119" end="00:16:48.970" style="s2">order to read the words I must read each</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.869" end="00:16:51.610" style="s2">individual letter but in order to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.970" end="00:16:54.370" style="s2">disambiguate each letter I must have</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.610" end="00:16:58.509" style="s2">read the whole word therefore reading is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.370" end="00:17:00.939" style="s2">impossible now of course reading isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.509" end="00:17:03.309" style="s2">impossible which means something else</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.939" end="00:17:05.620" style="s2">has to change what has to change is you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.309" end="00:17:08.110" style="s2">our model of attention the searchlight</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.620" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">metaphor the spotlight metaphor can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.110" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">address that problem here&#39;s the what</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:14.649" style="s2">your attention is actually doing its</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">simultaneously going up from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.649" end="00:17:21.789" style="s2">features to the gestalt the eye dose the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:25.270" style="s2">structural functional whole and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.789" end="00:17:27.189" style="s2">going down from the gestalt the words to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.270" end="00:17:31.690" style="s2">the individual letters the features its</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.189" end="00:17:33.880" style="s2">simultaneously doing that your attention</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.690" end="00:17:36.460" style="s2">is also doing this so not only is your</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.880" end="00:17:39.370" style="s2">attention flowing in and out right doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.460" end="00:17:42.070" style="s2">transparency opacity shifting it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.370" end="00:17:43.779" style="s2">flowing up and down between feature and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.070" end="00:17:46.830" style="s2">Gestalt your attention is doing all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.779" end="00:17:46.830" style="s2">that is doing it right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.950" end="00:17:52.630" style="s2">and the spotlight metaphor doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.149" end="00:17:55.750" style="s2">capture any of that and mindfulness has</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.630" end="00:17:58.360" style="s2">to do with making use of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.750" end="00:18:00.550" style="s2">complex dynamical remember what</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.360" end="00:18:03.040" style="s2">dynamical systems are dynamical process</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.550" end="00:18:05.680" style="s2">saying these are dynamic self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.040" end="00:18:09.240" style="s2">processes and they can be optimized and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.680" end="00:18:14.320" style="s2">mindfulness optimizes them in some way</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to put something up on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:17.890" style="s2">board it looks like a graph but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.940" end="00:18:20.760" style="s2">a graph because it doesn&#39;t have absolute</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.760" end="00:18:31.030" style="s2">because it has relative position so when</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:32.140" style="s2">I move this way like we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.030" end="00:18:34.930" style="s2">about when we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.140" end="00:18:37.420" style="s2">polanyi&#39;s work I&#39;m doing transparency to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.930" end="00:18:41.020" style="s2">opacity shifting and going this way is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.420" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">to do transparency to opacity and to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.020" end="00:18:46.540" style="s2">this way is to do opacity to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:48.160" style="s2">transparency it&#39;s not an app no position</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.540" end="00:18:50.290" style="s2">is transparent and the other is opaque</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:52.420" style="s2">it&#39;s always the direction that matters</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.290" end="00:18:55.090" style="s2">more I move this way the more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.420" end="00:18:57.370" style="s2">stepping back and looking at the more I</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.370" end="00:19:06.130" style="s2">looking out into the world then we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.950" end="00:19:08.470" style="s2">this I can be going down from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.130" end="00:19:11.650" style="s2">gestalt to the features using the word</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.690" end="00:21:03.160" style="s2">Gestalt into features for example you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.480" end="00:21:06.040" style="s2">were breaking up your experience of your</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.160" end="00:21:07.630" style="s2">whole finger into individual sections of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.040" end="00:21:10.030" style="s2">your finger when we were doing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.630" end="00:21:12.490" style="s2">experiment you were breaking up the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.030" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">whole of the cup into individual moments</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.490" end="00:21:20.110" style="s2">of contact so very often where all these</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:25.240" style="s2">two two come together let&#39;s call this</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.110" end="00:21:27.960" style="s2">scaling up of attention and scaling down</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.240" end="00:21:27.960" style="s2">of attention</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.960" end="00:21:38.210" style="s2">so first of all let&#39;s map these on to</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.450" end="00:21:40.870" style="s2">mindfulness practices to make clear why</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.210" end="00:21:40.870" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.290" end="00:21:48.110" style="s2">so I teach my students of a Poisson uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.400" end="00:21:50.390" style="s2">very traditional form of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:52.280" style="s2">notice what the word meditation means it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.390" end="00:21:54.800" style="s2">actually means moving towards the center</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.280" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">so we know it&#39;s going to have this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.800" end="00:21:58.970" style="s2">aspect to it so what do you two well</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:01.570" style="s2">typically you train people by telling</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.970" end="00:22:04.580" style="s2">them to pay attention to their breath</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.570" end="00:22:07.790" style="s2">right so first of all what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.580" end="00:22:09.110" style="s2">is paying attention not to the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.790" end="00:22:10.310" style="s2">they&#39;re stepping back but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.110" end="00:22:12.230" style="s2">really paying attention to the breath</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.310" end="00:22:14.420" style="s2">what you tell them is the following</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.230" end="00:22:15.590" style="s2">again language of explaining not the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.420" end="00:22:17.450" style="s2">language of training look at it when</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.590" end="00:22:18.860" style="s2">much more fine-grain you tell them to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.450" end="00:22:20.660" style="s2">pay attention to the feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.860" end="00:22:22.580" style="s2">sensations that are being generated in</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.660" end="00:22:24.560" style="s2">their abdomen as they breathe so as they</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.580" end="00:22:26.900" style="s2">inhale they&#39;re feeling sensations in</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.560" end="00:22:29.720" style="s2">their abdomen and as they exhale and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.900" end="00:22:31.820" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing is trying to write do</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.720" end="00:22:33.770" style="s2">that that like I did with my finger</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.820" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to maintain and renew</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.770" end="00:22:36.890" style="s2">their interest constantly make it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:40.090" style="s2">salient to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.890" end="00:22:45.350" style="s2">now notice what&#39;s happening normally</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.090" end="00:22:47.240" style="s2">write our embodied sensations I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.350" end="00:22:48.770" style="s2">happy with that word for sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.240" end="00:22:50.360" style="s2">philosophically important reasons but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.770" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">don&#39;t have time to go into it right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.360" end="00:22:55.190" style="s2">right normally we don&#39;t pay attention so</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:57.670" style="s2">much to our sensations we pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.190" end="00:23:00.080" style="s2">through our sensations to the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.670" end="00:23:02.150" style="s2">right so normally I&#39;m not paying</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.080" end="00:23:05.770" style="s2">attention to my feelings I&#39;m paying</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.150" end="00:23:05.770" style="s2">attention through my feelings to the cup</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.890" end="00:23:11.420" style="s2">when meditation I&#39;m stepping back and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.500" end="00:23:15.490" style="s2">not looking through my sensations I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.420" end="00:23:18.530" style="s2">stepping back and looking at them right</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.490" end="00:23:21.430" style="s2">that&#39;s like I don&#39;t look through the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.530" end="00:23:24.560" style="s2">my mind is framing things I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.430" end="00:23:26.930" style="s2">the framing I also do something else I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.560" end="00:23:29.390" style="s2">don&#39;t just look at it as one blob I do</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.930" end="00:23:32.470" style="s2">something like observational analysis I</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.390" end="00:23:36.980" style="s2">break the gestalt up into separate</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.470" end="00:23:39.560" style="s2">experiences I&#39;m doing this I am stepping</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.980" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">back and looking at and I&#39;m breaking the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.560" end="00:23:45.500" style="s2">gestalt of my experience up into its</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.850" style="s2">features it&#39;s atomic features</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.500" end="00:23:51.860" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me a metaphor that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.850" end="00:23:54.410" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t push too far that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.860" end="00:23:56.270" style="s2">do in meditation and we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.410" end="00:23:57.890" style="s2">why would you do this why would that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.270" end="00:24:04.430" style="s2">matter and importantly our question is</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.890" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">why would that help cause the insight so</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.430" end="00:24:07.610" style="s2">that&#39;s it meditation that&#39;s for passin</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:10.460" style="s2">for example I also teach my students a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.610" end="00:24:12.350" style="s2">contemplative practice so the word</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.460" end="00:24:15.800" style="s2">meditation means to move towards the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.350" end="00:24:18.670" style="s2">center and that fits perfectly with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.800" end="00:24:23.780" style="s2">past and this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.670" end="00:24:27.140" style="s2">contemplation now it bespeaks how how</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.780" end="00:24:30.020" style="s2">overly simplified the West is in trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.140" end="00:24:31.780" style="s2">to understand this in that these terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.020" end="00:24:33.830" style="s2">are now treated as synonyms</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.780" end="00:24:35.540" style="s2">contemplative practices meditative</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.830" end="00:24:37.280" style="s2">practices it&#39;s all the same thing are</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.540" end="00:24:40.490" style="s2">these just synonyms they&#39;re not synonyms</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.280" end="00:24:42.620" style="s2">and paying attention to their etymology</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.490" end="00:24:44.900" style="s2">will quickly reveal this first of all</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.620" end="00:24:49.220" style="s2">the Latin etymology this look what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.900" end="00:24:51.080" style="s2">the center of this is temple it comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.220" end="00:24:53.450" style="s2">from a temple which actually comes from</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.080" end="00:24:55.340" style="s2">the Latin word for a part of the sky</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.450" end="00:24:58.010" style="s2">that you look up to to see the signs</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.340" end="00:25:03.950" style="s2">from the gods to contemplate is to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.010" end="00:25:06.140" style="s2">up towards the divine this also goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.950" end="00:25:09.590" style="s2">well and convergent with the Contin</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.140" end="00:25:14.270" style="s2">Plataea the latin term was a translation</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.590" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">of this greek word theoria and the--</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.270" end="00:25:19.100" style="s2">oriya also originally doesn&#39;t mean</p>

<p begin="00:25:21.410" end="00:25:28.310" style="s2">with furia is I try to see more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.020" end="00:25:31.070" style="s2">into reality to see meditation is moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.310" end="00:25:33.370" style="s2">this way and contemplation is moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.070" end="00:25:33.370" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.430" end="00:25:39.460" style="s2">meditation emphasizes scaling down</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.980" end="00:25:42.680" style="s2">contemplation emphasizes scaling up and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.460" end="00:25:44.900" style="s2">I was taught both in fact I was taught</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.680" end="00:25:47.330" style="s2">three things in an integrated fashion I</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.900" end="00:25:50.840" style="s2">was taught of a pasta a scaling down</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.330" end="00:25:52.280" style="s2">strategy I was taught Metta a scaling up</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.840" end="00:25:54.440" style="s2">strategy and you&#39;re scaling up with your</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.280" end="00:25:55.640" style="s2">sense of identity by the way well</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.440" end="00:25:57.530" style="s2">thought will come back to that later and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.640" end="00:25:58.340" style="s2">then I was taught Tai Chi Chuan</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.530" end="00:26:02.260" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.340" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">Chi Chuan is about moving right in and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.260" end="00:26:10.190" style="s2">out in and out flowing between these</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:13.130" style="s2">inner and outer movements in a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.190" end="00:26:16.520" style="s2">and optimizing fashion white why teach</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.130" end="00:26:19.100" style="s2">me all these things together because</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.520" end="00:26:21.350" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a system of these psycho</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.100" end="00:26:26.390" style="s2">technologies that will optimize your</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.350" end="00:26:28.130" style="s2">cognition for insight okay so do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.390" end="00:26:31.940" style="s2">remember we did the nine dot problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.130" end="00:26:36.649" style="s2">right we talked about that remember the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.940" end="00:26:39.700" style="s2">fact that you can miss frame things so</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.649" end="00:26:39.700" style="s2">let&#39;s do the nine dot</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.570" end="00:26:49.370" style="s2">all nine dots with four straight lines</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.010" end="00:26:50.990" style="s2">and people find it difficult why</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.370" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">remember we talked about this they</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.990" end="00:26:54.860" style="s2">automatically listen to the words</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:57.190" style="s2">remember they automatically and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.860" end="00:27:00.620" style="s2">unconsciously project a square there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.190" end="00:27:03.049" style="s2">then they automatically take this to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.620" end="00:27:05.210" style="s2">a connect the dot problems and so no non</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.049" end="00:27:07.159" style="s2">dot turns are possible and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.210" end="00:27:09.740" style="s2">they can&#39;t get the solution the solution</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.159" end="00:27:13.580" style="s2">is here&#39;s four straight lines one two</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.740" end="00:27:15.799" style="s2">three four the reason why people find</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.580" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">that so difficult is I have to break the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.799" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">square and I have to not treat it as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:23.179" style="s2">typical connect-the-dot problem I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:25.070" style="s2">to not treat it categorically to use</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.179" end="00:27:27.260" style="s2">language you&#39;ve heard already because</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.070" end="00:27:31.070" style="s2">you don&#39;t do non dot turns remember this</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.260" end="00:27:34.210" style="s2">now notice there&#39;s two mu moments to</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.070" end="00:27:37.010" style="s2">having an insight I have to break up an</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.210" end="00:27:42.760" style="s2">inappropriate frame what do I have to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.010" end="00:27:46.669" style="s2">I have to break up the gestalt right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.760" end="00:27:49.190" style="s2">I also have to do Dymatize my cognition</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.669" end="00:27:51.470" style="s2">I have to make it not operate</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.190" end="00:27:53.630" style="s2">unconsciously and automatically well how</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.470" end="00:27:56.539" style="s2">do I do that I take stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.630" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">normally happening unconsciously and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.539" end="00:28:02.149" style="s2">have to bring it back into consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:04.909" style="s2">yes that makes sense how do I do that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.149" end="00:28:08.840" style="s2">do that by doing a transparency opacity</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.909" end="00:28:12.140" style="s2">shift normally I&#39;m automatically sensing</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.840" end="00:28:15.350" style="s2">through my probe but I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.140" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">shift my awareness and become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.350" end="00:28:21.500" style="s2">my probe I can bring things back into</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.400" end="00:30:22.280" style="s2">voi we take pictures that are out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.730" end="00:30:23.750" style="s2">focus and refocus them and in mentally</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.280" end="00:30:25.789" style="s2">so we can suddenly see what the picture</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.059" end="00:30:45.799" style="s2">both also make you worse because if I if</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.889" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">I just scale up if I just maximize like</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.799" end="00:30:51.320" style="s2">taking the string then of course I will</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:56.149" style="s2">immediately project the square and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.320" end="00:30:58.070" style="s2">unlocked well shouldn&#39;t I just scale</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.149" end="00:31:01.789" style="s2">down just meditate always if I just keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.070" end="00:31:04.429" style="s2">breaking up your stalls I&#39;ll never make</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.789" end="00:31:06.710" style="s2">the solution I&#39;ll choke myself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.429" end="00:31:09.019" style="s2">what happens when people are choking you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.710" end="00:31:11.869" style="s2">get away like if your sparring with</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.019" end="00:31:14.139" style="s2">somebody a way to get them off is to</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.869" end="00:31:16.759" style="s2">compliment them that was a really good</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.139" end="00:31:18.619" style="s2">like right hook you just threw because</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.759" end="00:31:20.179" style="s2">then the person will start stepping back</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.619" end="00:31:22.220" style="s2">and looking at it and they&#39;ll get all</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.179" end="00:31:26.629" style="s2">screwed up because they&#39;ll break up the</p>

<p begin="00:31:26.629" end="00:31:31.220" style="s2">notice what I&#39;m saying cuz and stick</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.879" end="00:31:35.899" style="s2">with me because this is really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.220" end="00:31:39.259" style="s2">tricky this can improve your chances for</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.899" end="00:31:41.629" style="s2">insight by breaking up a bad frame but</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.259" end="00:31:44.989" style="s2">it can also mess up your problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.629" end="00:31:48.229" style="s2">by causing you to choke this can improve</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.989" end="00:31:51.739" style="s2">your ability for insight by causing you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.229" end="00:31:55.759" style="s2">to make a better frame but this can also</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.739" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">cause you to leap into an inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.759" end="00:32:02.599" style="s2">frame and be locked in fixation so what</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:05.690" style="s2">should you do you don&#39;t want the strings</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.599" end="00:32:10.059" style="s2">too tight you don&#39;t want the strings too</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.690" end="00:32:13.070" style="s2">loose and you don&#39;t want it just halfway</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.059" end="00:32:15.769" style="s2">well what do you want to do is you want</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.070" end="00:32:19.330" style="s2">to train people in both of these skills</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.769" end="00:32:21.739" style="s2">and then train them to flow between them</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.429" end="00:33:37.299" style="s2">notice what we&#39;ve said here we have an</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.299" end="00:33:44.659" style="s2">what&#39;s mindfulness doing mindfulness is</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.490" end="00:33:47.630" style="s2">basically teaching us how to appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.659" end="00:33:51.559" style="s2">and train a flexibility of attentional</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.630" end="00:33:55.399" style="s2">scaling so that we can intervene</p>

<p begin="00:33:55.399" end="00:34:02.950" style="s2">problems and increase the chances of</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.549" end="00:34:10.849" style="s2">notice that this didn&#39;t really what how</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.260" end="00:34:16.490" style="s2">is being present making you more</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.849" end="00:34:19.220" style="s2">insightful but I&#39;ve given you a way of</p>

<p begin="00:34:19.220" end="00:34:25.369" style="s2">when I&#39;m scaling down I&#39;m actually like</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.369" end="00:34:36.169" style="s2">less inferential I&#39;m doing all of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:39.409" style="s2">work to become aware of and gain some</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.159" end="00:34:46.629" style="s2">will make me more insightful</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.170" end="00:34:51.770" style="s2">what happens if you were just to scale</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.270" end="00:34:53.090" style="s2">down and practice scaling down and</p>

<p begin="00:34:53.090" end="00:34:58.130" style="s2">scaling down well you can actually get</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.640" end="00:35:02.980" style="s2">to one kind of important mystical</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.050" end="00:35:31.850" style="s2">practicing meditation is you try and</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.710" end="00:35:37.840" style="s2">is it&#39;s hard to maintain because you</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.720" end="00:35:39.650" style="s2">have such deep developed habits of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.840" end="00:35:40.760" style="s2">directing your attention back out</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.650" end="00:35:42.650" style="s2">towards the world and you start thinking</p>

<p begin="00:35:42.650" end="00:35:45.350" style="s2">this and then what you have to do is you</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.790" end="00:35:46.730" style="s2">have to bring your attention back again</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.350" end="00:35:48.410" style="s2">you have to you have to do that yet the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.730" end="00:35:50.120" style="s2">recenter and step back and look at your</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.410" end="00:35:51.860" style="s2">mind rather than automatically looking</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.120" end="00:35:54.260" style="s2">through it and you keep practicing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.860" end="00:35:56.650" style="s2">that&#39;s like that or and it&#39;s in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.260" end="00:35:58.940" style="s2">arduous but these are like doing reps</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.650" end="00:36:02.120" style="s2">that&#39;s meditation meditation is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.940" end="00:36:04.940" style="s2">you&#39;re building this ability to step</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.120" end="00:36:07.640" style="s2">back and look at your mind and then what</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.289" end="00:37:39.859" style="s2">and you already know what that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.359" end="00:37:42.140" style="s2">cuz we&#39;ve already talked about it think</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.859" end="00:37:44.749" style="s2">about that as just a super flow state in</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.140" end="00:37:50.140" style="s2">which I&#39;m deeply at one with everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.749" end="00:37:50.140" style="s2">super flow state resonant at one minute</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.730" end="00:38:00.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t use a tone mint because that has</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.130" end="00:38:04.369" style="s2">a particular Christian meaning that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.420" end="00:38:04.369" style="s2">not trying to invoke here at one mint</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.849" end="00:38:12.089" style="s2">see this model of mindfulness explains</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.859" end="00:38:13.890" style="s2">why people get into these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.089" end="00:38:16.109" style="s2">mystical experiences if they do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.890" end="00:38:17.910" style="s2">meditative practices they will get a</p>

<p begin="00:38:28.680" end="00:38:35.240" style="s2">ultimately is we want these two together</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.540" end="00:38:43.170" style="s2">there&#39;s a third state and this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:49.650" style="s2">actually the state that matters this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.170" end="00:38:52.140" style="s2">called the state of non-duality so let</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.650" end="00:38:54.089" style="s2">me try and explain to you a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.140" end="00:38:57.410" style="s2">you can at least imagine you could get</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.089" end="00:39:00.200" style="s2">into it it&#39;s a way of trained people</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.410" end="00:39:02.309" style="s2">imagine that you&#39;re going to be cycling</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.200" end="00:39:04.859" style="s2">scaling up and scaling down with your</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.309" end="00:39:07.319" style="s2">breath so as you inhale you scale up and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.859" end="00:39:09.750" style="s2">you do that sort of resonant at one min</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.319" end="00:39:11.400" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to write be it like</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.750" end="00:39:13.079" style="s2">flowing at one minute with everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.400" end="00:39:15.630" style="s2">and then as you exhale you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.079" end="00:39:17.339" style="s2">apostille you&#39;re trying to step back as</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.630" end="00:39:20.040" style="s2">close as you can to the pure</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.339" end="00:39:23.990" style="s2">consciousness event and you you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.040" end="00:39:23.990" style="s2">oscillate back and forth with the breath</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.230" end="00:39:30.119" style="s2">and you often have to do that for years</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.770" end="00:39:31.319" style="s2">but what can happen and there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.119" end="00:39:33.150" style="s2">ways of getting into this state this</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.319" end="00:39:36.510" style="s2">isn&#39;t exclusive this is one way way I</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.150" end="00:39:38.010" style="s2">was taught what can happen is you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.510" end="00:39:40.470" style="s2">have the third kind of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.010" end="00:39:43.710" style="s2">experience it&#39;s not the pure</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.470" end="00:39:46.410" style="s2">consciousness event it&#39;s not resonant at</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.710" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">one mint it includes both and transcends</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.410" end="00:39:50.849" style="s2">both it&#39;s both at the same time your</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:53.309" style="s2">awareness is deeply to the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.849" end="00:39:55.530" style="s2">your consciousness and deeply to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.309" end="00:39:59.569" style="s2">depths of reality and it&#39;s completely at</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.530" end="00:40:03.390" style="s2">one it&#39;s it&#39;s all at once</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.569" end="00:40:08.920" style="s2">mm-hmm there&#39;s a progeny state</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.390" end="00:40:14.080" style="s2">the state of non-duality this is a one</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.920" end="00:40:17.080" style="s2">term for wisdom this is kind of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.080" end="00:40:18.790" style="s2">experience now this is the state that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.080" end="00:40:21.940" style="s2">actually thought for that non-duality</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.790" end="00:40:25.960" style="s2">because this is the state that should</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.940" end="00:40:29.500" style="s2">lead to a comprehensive capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.960" end="00:40:31.240" style="s2">insight because you&#39;re not gonna have an</p>

<p begin="00:40:47.590" end="00:40:55.270" style="s2">and you&#39;re pushing that machinery to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.460" end="00:40:57.570" style="s2">optimize so that you can see in as</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.580" end="00:41:35.650" style="s2">in fact of course what&#39;s it hard to</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.320" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">what happened was a radical</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.030" end="00:45:54.930" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.000" end="00:45:57.560" style="s2">people will have a kind of altered state</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.930" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">of consciousness that in my mind it</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.560" end="00:46:02.670" style="s2">recapitulates the axial revolution look</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:05.070" style="s2">normally when you have an altered state</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.670" end="00:46:07.770" style="s2">of consciousness let&#39;s pick up on Sid</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.070" end="00:46:10.109" style="s2">Hart his metaphor awakening wakening up</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.770" end="00:46:12.990" style="s2">that&#39;s in contrast to being asleep to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.109" end="00:46:14.820" style="s2">dreaming so what happens in your typical</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.990" end="00:46:16.530" style="s2">state of altered state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.820" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">one that you experience every night</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.530" end="00:46:20.130" style="s2">you&#39;re dreaming and when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:22.050" style="s2">dream state you think that that world is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.130" end="00:46:24.450" style="s2">real you interact with it is it real but</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.050" end="00:46:27.720" style="s2">when you wake up you go oh ha that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.450" end="00:46:34.470" style="s2">just a dream that wasn&#39;t real this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.720" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">real this normally when we come out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.470" end="00:46:37.980" style="s2">an altered state of consciousness we</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:42.030" style="s2">point at it the finger of rejection and</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.980" end="00:46:44.580" style="s2">say that isn&#39;t real oh I was drunk</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.030" end="00:46:52.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not real oh I was high that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.580" end="00:46:54.330" style="s2">real but sometimes people have certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.320" end="00:46:55.890" style="s2">kinds of experiences altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.330" end="00:47:00.180" style="s2">consciousness in which exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.890" end="00:47:03.210" style="s2">opposite occurs they go into that state</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.180" end="00:47:07.800" style="s2">and they come back and they say that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.210" end="00:47:13.070" style="s2">more real that was really real and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.800" end="00:47:17.250" style="s2">is less real do you see how that&#39;s axial</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.070" end="00:47:18.869" style="s2">that&#39;s like weight that higher higher</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.250" end="00:47:20.490" style="s2">why do we call it a higher state of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.869" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">consciousness that higher state of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.490" end="00:47:30.170" style="s2">consciousness that I had access to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">real world and when I come back like</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.170" end="00:47:38.220" style="s2">like somebody in Plato&#39;s cave I&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:41.670" style="s2">back out of the sunlight this I now</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.220" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">realize is only echoes and shadows it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.670" end="00:47:48.150" style="s2">less real in fact and because of my</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:51.780" style="s2">desire to be in contact with what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.150" end="00:47:54.839" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna change myself and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.780" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">change my world to try and recapture</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.839" end="00:48:01.619" style="s2">zappy</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:48:06.359" style="s2">sati to remember what that&#39;s like I want</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.619" end="00:48:07.740" style="s2">to live in greater contact with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.359" end="00:48:09.930" style="s2">really real and so they start to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.740" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">transform their whole lives and their</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.930" end="00:48:14.039" style="s2">whole self the whole agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:18.589" style="s2">relationship is completely and radically</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.039" end="00:48:21.240" style="s2">radically revolutionarily restructured</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.589" end="00:48:22.859" style="s2">this is known as quantum change Theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.240" end="00:48:30.180" style="s2">bad name bad name</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.859" end="00:48:33.180" style="s2">good theory people do this this is of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.180" end="00:48:34.859" style="s2">course very important for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.180" end="00:48:38.160" style="s2">what happened to people like Sid Hara in</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.859" end="00:48:40.530" style="s2">fact most of the world religions that</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">emerge at the axial revolution are</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.530" end="00:48:46.770" style="s2">predicated on the idea that there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:52.289" style="s2">higher states of consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.770" end="00:48:54.210" style="s2">should empower challenged and encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.289" end="00:48:56.670" style="s2">us to engage in such quantum</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.670" end="00:49:02.069" style="s2">radical transformative experiences it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:05.220" style="s2">obviously at the core of Buddhism you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.069" end="00:49:08.339" style="s2">experience Sitara Satori right</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.220" end="00:49:10.710" style="s2">you realize Shunyata it&#39;s at the core</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.339" end="00:49:12.930" style="s2">right of Vedanta when I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.710" end="00:49:17.869" style="s2">moksha and release it&#39;s at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.930" end="00:49:17.869" style="s2">Taoism I realized the doubt so</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.890" end="00:49:28.539" style="s2">how is it right that these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.890" end="00:49:30.039" style="s2">have such authority but it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.539" end="00:49:33.249" style="s2">just that they&#39;re they&#39;re important</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.039" end="00:49:36.039" style="s2">historically right there at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.249" end="00:49:37.660" style="s2">the world religions right and you and</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.039" end="00:49:39.640" style="s2">you say well what about the Western like</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.660" end="00:49:41.740" style="s2">Sufism within Islam and the christian</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.640" end="00:49:44.109" style="s2">mystic tradition and Kabbalah like all</p>

<p begin="00:49:57.730" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">important enough but it like when you do</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.470" end="00:50:05.049" style="s2">surveys if you look at some of the work</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:07.269" style="s2">that&#39;s been done thirty to forty percent</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.049" end="00:50:12.249" style="s2">of the population has experienced these</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.269" end="00:50:15.490" style="s2">events and it&#39;s like flow across</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.009" end="00:50:39.480" style="s2">quantitatively scientifically it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.900" end="00:50:43.239" style="s2">this is an important phenomenon and</p>
