<p begin="00:16:29.430" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">I&#39;m like I love though how I even laid</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.430" end="00:16:37.500" style="s2">it out I kind of ignored the agency part</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.770" end="00:16:50.190" style="s2">this and then I might go off in ten</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.960" end="00:16:52.550" style="s2">minutes so maybe this one would be half</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.070" end="00:18:57.000" style="s2">can get 20 or 80 percent of my calories</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.650" end="00:19:00.540" style="s2">from 20 percent of the food right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.000" end="00:19:02.340" style="s2">80% of my nutrients to 24 from 20% of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.540" end="00:19:04.200" style="s2">cost but I can&#39;t do all of that at once</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.340" end="00:19:06.870" style="s2">I can&#39;t do everything not without a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.200" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">of people also working together to do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.870" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">I know we can do it together but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:17.370" style="s2">I was like one of any of that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:19.080" style="s2">oh that I&#39;m so i discount what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.370" end="00:19:20.280" style="s2">in this space and yet when I look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.080" end="00:19:21.960" style="s2">what other people are doing in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.280" end="00:19:24.090" style="s2">space granted they also have hope they</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.960" end="00:19:26.400" style="s2">have full-time jobs I don&#39;t and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.090" end="00:19:28.470" style="s2">have families and life as well but when</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">I look at what people are physically</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.470" end="00:19:33.000" style="s2">doing in the space and like I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:37.110" style="s2">part of the naive the 20% doing the 80%</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.000" end="00:19:39.630" style="s2">but I&#39;m doing it in a diminishing rate</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.110" end="00:19:42.030" style="s2">of returns way I&#39;m doing it within my</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.630" end="00:19:45.060" style="s2">capacity because I can&#39;t do it outside</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.030" end="00:19:46.950" style="s2">of my capacity so what I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.060" end="00:19:48.420" style="s2">holding ITA cafes on Tuesday I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.950" end="00:19:50.340" style="s2">participating and Eric&#39;s thing for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.420" end="00:19:51.720" style="s2">mega group on Wednesdays which is not I</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.340" end="00:19:53.070" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t consider that as part of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.720" end="00:19:54.150" style="s2">contribution but it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.070" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">something that I get</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.150" end="00:19:58.680" style="s2">contributed but everyone who</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:19:59.790" style="s2">participates in that gets something out</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.680" end="00:20:01.230" style="s2">of it or they wouldn&#39;t keep showing up</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.790" end="00:20:02.850" style="s2">every week and I both and giving and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.230" end="00:20:04.770" style="s2">getting that&#39;s part of and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.850" end="00:20:06.030" style="s2">reciprocity although the word and when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.770" end="00:20:07.830" style="s2">looked up the definition I was like</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.030" end="00:20:09.960" style="s2">actually okay I&#39;m gonna throw some</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.830" end="00:20:12.150" style="s2">prosody it&#39;s actually about everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.960" end="00:20:13.920" style="s2">getting benefit and if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.150" end="00:20:15.720" style="s2">about that way I agree with it but when</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.920" end="00:20:18.090" style="s2">libertarians come hit me there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.720" end="00:20:19.590" style="s2">like like this everyone needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.090" end="00:20:24.150" style="s2">independent and you need to think like</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.590" end="00:20:26.850" style="s2">me the biggest irony I can&#39;t and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.150" end="00:20:28.650" style="s2">it like I get it I&#39;m also I have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.850" end="00:20:30.630" style="s2">that can save the world I want people to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.650" end="00:20:32.460" style="s2">come on board for my idea partly because</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.630" end="00:20:34.020" style="s2">my idea isn&#39;t my idea it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.460" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">that we create together it is about</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.020" end="00:20:37.830" style="s2">right if I create this and then present</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">it to you I have to sell it to you if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.830" end="00:20:42.570" style="s2">create together it&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:44.460" style="s2">different energy and so that is what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.570" end="00:20:45.810" style="s2">need to tap into I&#39;m not looking at it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.460" end="00:20:47.340" style="s2">it&#39;s happening - I&#39;m gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.810" end="00:20:48.780" style="s2">Emperor of the world and I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.340" end="00:20:49.350" style="s2">the one who gets to create everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.780" end="00:20:52.020" style="s2">for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.350" end="00:20:53.640" style="s2">I want to tap into like our collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.020" end="00:20:55.260" style="s2">intelligence because with collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.640" end="00:20:57.030" style="s2">intelligence also comes collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.260" end="00:20:58.860" style="s2">energy to actually put it out each of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.030" end="00:21:03.510" style="s2">the world and as somebody with limited</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.860" end="00:21:05.220" style="s2">energy and an abundance of ideas that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.510" end="00:21:06.510" style="s2">a problem because I can&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.220" end="00:21:08.010" style="s2">energy but any of it on the world by</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.510" end="00:21:09.330" style="s2">myself and none of them are supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.010" end="00:21:12.270" style="s2">be put out in the world by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.330" end="00:21:14.670" style="s2">like a lot of what is happening like my</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.270" end="00:21:16.680" style="s2">passion is bringing people together for</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.670" end="00:21:19.320" style="s2">a conversation and using technology to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.680" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">empower the masses to live the life you</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.320" end="00:21:24.510" style="s2">want to live but I&#39;m also a very risk</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:26.370" style="s2">and first person so the idea of putting</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.510" end="00:21:28.050" style="s2">any of my money or any of my energy into</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.370" end="00:21:29.850" style="s2">actually creating the technology when I</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.050" end="00:21:32.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know if people want it or lose it</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.850" end="00:21:34.440" style="s2">is actually what I bring to the table</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.520" end="00:21:36.150" style="s2">because other people who can code and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.440" end="00:21:37.470" style="s2">don&#39;t need to put money in are coding</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.150" end="00:21:40.290" style="s2">all of these things but nobody&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.470" end="00:21:42.270" style="s2">them because there&#39;s another thing I</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.290" end="00:21:43.530" style="s2">encountered this morning which a baby ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.270" end="00:21:46.560" style="s2">so share because it&#39;s coming up it also</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.240" end="00:22:24.010" style="s2">idea you can upload it I would totally</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.860" end="00:22:27.100" style="s2">use it if it was free but it&#39;s not free</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:03.519" style="s2">it and see if it would work before even</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.149" end="00:23:06.070" style="s2">signing up for the free option they want</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.519" end="00:23:07.539" style="s2">you to have a live demo with them and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.070" end="00:23:08.620" style="s2">I was so I was like fine I&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.539" end="00:23:10.360" style="s2">live demo I&#39;m good with that</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.620" end="00:23:12.309" style="s2">but all of their times because they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.580" end="00:23:22.120" style="s2">work so I just want to play around with</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.899" end="00:23:23.710" style="s2">the tool I don&#39;t think it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.120" end="00:23:25.179" style="s2">complex of a tool I don&#39;t know why he</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.710" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">would need a demo besides the fact you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.179" end="00:23:30.010" style="s2">want to sell me a $250 luck package it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.010" end="00:23:33.370" style="s2">ideas that&#39;s been coming through for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.179" end="00:23:35.110" style="s2">last few days that&#39;s what I have been</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.370" end="00:23:36.070" style="s2">doing a solution raising which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.110" end="00:23:38.679" style="s2">getting together for an hour-long</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.070" end="00:23:40.090" style="s2">conversation and at the end we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.679" end="00:23:41.799" style="s2">potential solutions that we could</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.090" end="00:23:42.970" style="s2">actually create together if we had ten</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.799" end="00:23:44.289" style="s2">thousand people in a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.970" end="00:23:45.909" style="s2">dollars they&#39;re not things we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.289" end="00:23:48.399" style="s2">to create and make the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.909" end="00:23:49.570" style="s2">use it&#39;s like can we create a solution</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.399" end="00:23:51.880" style="s2">for ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.570" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">what would ten thousand people creating</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.880" end="00:23:58.299" style="s2">a a food app look like right like what</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:24:00.490" style="s2">so it meets their needs not so that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.299" end="00:24:01.870" style="s2">app gets provided for and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.490" end="00:24:02.889" style="s2">apps that are out there solving the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.870" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">problem they&#39;re solving and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.889" end="00:24:10.179" style="s2">awesome are charging way too much money</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:12.130" style="s2">for it and so I&#39;m both coming at it from</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.179" end="00:24:13.809" style="s2">both ends that like well I&#39;m gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.130" end="00:24:15.110" style="s2">through solutions you can figure out now</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.809" end="00:24:17.330" style="s2">that we have these six different</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.110" end="00:24:19.460" style="s2">gentle solutions how do we work through</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.330" end="00:24:20.750" style="s2">creating a process to get 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.460" end="00:24:22.340" style="s2">and how do we work through creating a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.750" end="00:24:24.380" style="s2">process to have ever more people so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.340" end="00:24:25.929" style="s2">only had the conversation with three to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.380" end="00:24:28.309" style="s2">five people</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.929" end="00:24:31.010" style="s2">yeah they don&#39;t it&#39;s not competitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.309" end="00:24:36.260" style="s2">right Steven anyway and so like you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.010" end="00:24:38.600" style="s2">a dozen different team working apps out</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.260" end="00:24:39.980" style="s2">there right Monday calm and idea notes</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.600" end="00:24:41.390" style="s2">and all these different things none of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.980" end="00:24:43.610" style="s2">them are perfect none of them have all</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.390" end="00:24:45.080" style="s2">of the features and all of them cost</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.610" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">money and they all cost much like</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.080" end="00:24:49.160" style="s2">ridiculous amounts of money where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:51.020" style="s2">like per team player your team person</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.160" end="00:24:52.250" style="s2">well if you have your only start up with</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.250" end="00:24:55.490" style="s2">millions of dollars no problem spend</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:57.799" style="s2">tens of thousands of dollars on other</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.490" end="00:24:59.720" style="s2">people&#39;s apps so that you can but like</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.799" end="00:25:01.100" style="s2">it&#39;s not integrating together so doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.720" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">work well they&#39;re not gonna be in</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.100" end="00:25:08.179" style="s2">business in a year because who&#39;s paying</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:10.669" style="s2">$250 to like branch ideas when you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.179" end="00:25:12.620" style="s2">do that with quorum calm for free like</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.669" end="00:25:14.090" style="s2">you could use I don&#39;t even know use read</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.620" end="00:25:15.650" style="s2">it and up vote things like there&#39;s ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.090" end="00:25:18.470" style="s2">you could kind of work around it for</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.650" end="00:25:20.090" style="s2">free but it&#39;s it&#39;s say anyway so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.470" end="00:25:21.260" style="s2">doing a solution racing and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.090" end="00:25:22.700" style="s2">how do we how do we bring people</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.260" end="00:25:24.290" style="s2">together for a conversation how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.700" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">have a feature it how we actually make</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.290" end="00:25:27.140" style="s2">it in the world and there&#39;s people with</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:29.570" style="s2">projects who are out in the world who I</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.140" end="00:25:31.640" style="s2">don&#39;t think in my thing they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.570" end="00:25:35.450" style="s2">doing it right they&#39;re not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.640" end="00:25:37.549" style="s2">doing it for their mission right if what</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.450" end="00:25:40.580" style="s2">the idea note or Monday comm wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.549" end="00:25:43.190" style="s2">have the most impact then it would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.580" end="00:25:44.390" style="s2">free or cheap to use but of course they</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.190" end="00:25:46.309" style="s2">also need to make money they need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.390" end="00:25:48.020" style="s2">make make enough money to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.309" end="00:25:49.910" style="s2">lights on looking food on their table</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.020" end="00:25:51.710" style="s2">and roof over their heads but they all</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.910" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">the apps seem to price themselves at</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.710" end="00:25:54.500" style="s2">that like what they need and how many</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:56.330" style="s2">people they are so they divided by that</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.500" end="00:25:58.580" style="s2">which isn&#39;t actually what people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.330" end="00:26:00.590" style="s2">willing to pay whereas if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.580" end="00:26:02.990" style="s2">collectively could get 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.590" end="00:26:05.990" style="s2">together and everyone put in $10 we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.990" end="00:26:07.100" style="s2">$100,000 to buy somebody&#39;s app now that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.990" end="00:26:09.470" style="s2">sounds like a low price to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.100" end="00:26:11.210" style="s2">somebody&#39;s app and it is but somebody</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.470" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">who wants their app to exist in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.210" end="00:26:17.630" style="s2">world and that we now own it together so</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">that we don&#39;t need to pay for member we</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.630" end="00:26:23.809" style="s2">don&#39;t need to pay like to truly make</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:26.929" style="s2">something that is a team building team</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.809" end="00:26:28.519" style="s2">organizing app we could create that from</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.929" end="00:26:30.019" style="s2">the ground up ourselves with 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.519" end="00:26:31.729" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars no problem it</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.019" end="00:26:33.769" style="s2">since it already exists out there we</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.729" end="00:26:35.330" style="s2">could also buy one that already exists</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.769" end="00:26:37.009" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s more than a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.330" end="00:26:38.869" style="s2">thousand dollars but the more because</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.009" end="00:26:40.339" style="s2">we&#39;re just starting out of course one</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.869" end="00:26:41.779" style="s2">probably gonna have to pay more than we</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.339" end="00:26:45.139" style="s2">would normally because people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.779" end="00:26:47.539" style="s2">if that&#39;s a sustainable model but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.139" end="00:26:49.159" style="s2">idea that the collective can buy your</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.539" end="00:26:50.509" style="s2">technology from you how much have you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.159" end="00:26:52.609" style="s2">put in now how much money because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.509" end="00:26:54.109" style="s2">ridiculous the startups here did the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.609" end="00:26:57.019" style="s2">money come from like if you want it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.109" end="00:26:58.849" style="s2">still exist in the world then we can buy</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.019" end="00:26:59.899" style="s2">it and keep it in the world and at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.849" end="00:27:02.329" style="s2">same time it might look nothing like</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.899" end="00:27:04.159" style="s2">what what you wanted to yet but that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.329" end="00:27:06.829" style="s2">could do that we could buy one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.159" end="00:27:09.229" style="s2">the existing team building ones together</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.829" end="00:27:10.549" style="s2">if we were one of the things we aim to</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.229" end="00:27:12.049" style="s2">do is figure out what the team building</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.549" end="00:27:15.619" style="s2">ones are which ones are owned by because</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.049" end="00:27:17.389" style="s2">Google and Facebook but if your other</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.619" end="00:27:19.219" style="s2">options to be eventually bought out by</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.389" end="00:27:21.559" style="s2">Facebook or Google or you can be bought</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.219" end="00:27:23.329" style="s2">out by the human collective people who</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.559" end="00:27:24.440" style="s2">like we all own this together and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.329" end="00:27:27.799" style="s2">we were going to improve it together</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.440" end="00:27:29.809" style="s2">it&#39;s approaching it from the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.799" end="00:27:31.489" style="s2">way it&#39;s like instead I think two of</p>

<p begin="00:27:32.839" end="00:27:36.349" style="s2">they have the free option then when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.909" end="00:27:37.820" style="s2">sign up it&#39;s not free they&#39;re like well</p>

<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:03.470" style="s2">to the table and be and be part of it so</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:04.850" style="s2">that their they don&#39;t so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.470" end="00:30:06.470" style="s2">the ones whose employees are still</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.850" end="00:30:11.240" style="s2">employed so they&#39;re the ones whose ideas</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.470" end="00:30:13.670" style="s2">still in the world and and yet this the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.240" end="00:30:16.660" style="s2">difference between efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.670" end="00:30:22.130" style="s2">redundancy that right now in the world a</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.660" end="00:30:24.380" style="s2">lot of our world is designed for maximum</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.130" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">efficiency and yet it&#39;s not because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.380" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">designed for profit which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:30.770" style="s2">incentivized to give you maximum</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:32.450" style="s2">efficiency so monopolies are</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.770" end="00:30:33.770" style="s2">incentivized in our world right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.450" end="00:30:36.110" style="s2">a reason Amazon&#39;s getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.770" end="00:30:37.940" style="s2">share of the market because they&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.110" end="00:30:40.070" style="s2">to be more and more efficient and pass</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.940" end="00:30:41.570" style="s2">some of that savings on to the consumer</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.070" end="00:30:45.020" style="s2">but a lot of it goes to just be Sousa</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.570" end="00:30:46.820" style="s2">and shareholders and so you need a</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.020" end="00:30:48.680" style="s2">balance between efficiency redundancy</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.820" end="00:30:50.780" style="s2">you don&#39;t want one factory that builds</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.680" end="00:30:54.680" style="s2">everything for the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.780" end="00:30:55.790" style="s2">you always want at least two I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.680" end="00:30:59.960" style="s2">know why this cover you into my</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.790" end="00:31:01.910" style="s2">at the same time but I really hate when</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.960" end="00:31:03.260" style="s2">I have to have one bathroom when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.910" end="00:31:05.270" style="s2">two of us and there&#39;s only one bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.260" end="00:31:06.770" style="s2">as soon as there&#39;s two bathrooms I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.270" end="00:31:08.390" style="s2">share that with ten people I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.770" end="00:31:09.920" style="s2">but like I need to know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.390" end="00:31:11.960" style="s2">having to shower I also have access to a</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.920" end="00:31:13.670" style="s2">toilet it&#39;s like I need to be at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.960" end="00:31:15.530" style="s2">two bedroom two bath rooms in any place</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.670" end="00:31:18.560" style="s2">that even it&#39;s like an Airbnb or</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.530" end="00:31:19.580" style="s2">something and I think that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.560" end="00:31:21.950" style="s2">people feel that way</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.580" end="00:31:23.480" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s hard to share one bathroom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.950" end="00:31:25.520" style="s2">not as hard to share two bathrooms and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.480" end="00:31:27.770" style="s2">it&#39;s not saving me somehow it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.520" end="00:31:31.040" style="s2">for if you have one factory and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.770" end="00:31:33.860" style="s2">something happens and or chipping</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.040" end="00:31:36.110" style="s2">changes that you don&#39;t want a factory at</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.860" end="00:31:38.330" style="s2">every factory in every country and every</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.110" end="00:31:41.420" style="s2">factory in every municipality that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.330" end="00:31:43.460" style="s2">that that does redundancy to the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.420" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">and we all pay the price for that but</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.460" end="00:31:50.330" style="s2">efficiency on the other end is one</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:51.800" style="s2">factory that provides it for everyone so</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.330" end="00:31:54.050" style="s2">that we can provide it for as cheap as</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.800" end="00:31:56.840" style="s2">possible and the problem is if</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.050" end="00:31:58.730" style="s2">transportation goes down the factory</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.840" end="00:32:01.490" style="s2">goes down for whatever reason you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.730" end="00:32:04.460" style="s2">have that at all and so you want some</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.490" end="00:32:06.620" style="s2">amount of redundancy and you want</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.460" end="00:32:09.080" style="s2">efficiency right now we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.620" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">have either because the efficiency that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.080" end="00:32:14.630" style="s2">does exist goes just like who profits</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:19.070" style="s2">from that efficiency it&#39;s not us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.630" end="00:32:20.090" style="s2">the shareholders and it&#39;s I do think we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.070" end="00:32:21.530" style="s2">can have the best of both worlds</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.090" end="00:32:23.870" style="s2">so those those two things do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.530" end="00:32:27.320" style="s2">trade-off we can have a world where we</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.870" end="00:32:28.370" style="s2">look at okay it makes sense for every</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.320" end="00:32:30.590" style="s2">country to have their own toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.370" end="00:32:31.790" style="s2">factory if we&#39;re gonna be using toilet</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.590" end="00:32:33.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense to talk about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.790" end="00:32:34.610" style="s2">a whole other discussion but if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.260" end="00:32:36.500" style="s2">going to be using toilet paper it makes</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.610" end="00:32:38.630" style="s2">sense for each country to have their own</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.500" end="00:32:40.370" style="s2">toilet paper Factory it makes sense even</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.630" end="00:32:41.630" style="s2">possibly urban neighborhood to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.370" end="00:32:45.650" style="s2">their own toilet paper Factory if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.630" end="00:32:47.270" style="s2">can feed paper into it right if instead</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.650" end="00:32:48.740" style="s2">of paper getting collected and ships</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.270" end="00:32:50.120" style="s2">over somewhere else and it gets made</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.740" end="00:32:52.340" style="s2">into something and then maybe it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.120" end="00:32:54.710" style="s2">me toilet I have to pay its premium for</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.340" end="00:32:57.980" style="s2">her reusable toilet paper or not reused</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:06.430" style="s2">kids know it&#39;s become the toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.710" end="00:33:09.140" style="s2">for our for our um community eventually</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.430" end="00:33:11.270" style="s2">like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.140" end="00:33:12.380" style="s2">if we&#39;re having a massive factory it</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.270" end="00:33:12.860" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense to have one at every</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.950" end="00:33:19.700" style="s2">small enough that it makes sense that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.450" end="00:33:21.740" style="s2">it&#39;s made there but having a widget</p>

<p begin="00:34:02.840" end="00:34:09.890" style="s2">having income coming in granular</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.300" end="00:34:13.700" style="s2">bottom-up approach I don&#39;t even buy</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.890" end="00:34:16.880" style="s2">granular granular bottom-up approach</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.700" end="00:34:18.050" style="s2">maybe you can I mean I could play look</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.880" end="00:34:20.410" style="s2">up what the definition is but that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.050" end="00:34:22.490" style="s2">generally isn&#39;t sufficient because um</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.410" end="00:34:24.470" style="s2">you might not have the same definition</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.490" end="00:34:26.570" style="s2">as Neuville and I don&#39;t have a saint of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.470" end="00:34:28.520" style="s2">ensure that I buy a bottom-up granular</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.570" end="00:34:30.770" style="s2">approach I think because the other piece</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.520" end="00:34:36.130" style="s2">of this is also diversity right not just</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.770" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">do we want access to toilet paper yes um</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.130" end="00:34:40.310" style="s2">do I get access to the brands of toilet</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:42.080" style="s2">paper that I want it&#39;s right I want it</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.310" end="00:34:44.990" style="s2">to be soft and durable and whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.080" end="00:34:46.790" style="s2">things for paper are and so if we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.990" end="00:34:47.840" style="s2">maximize for all the like toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.790" end="00:34:50.210" style="s2">is one of those things you probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.840" end="00:34:51.800" style="s2">could maximize for all of that but if</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.210" end="00:34:53.840" style="s2">your pasta sauce right someone likes</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.800" end="00:34:55.580" style="s2">pasta sauce that has chunky vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.840" end="00:34:57.140" style="s2">in it somebody wants vegetables in it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.580" end="00:34:58.610" style="s2">but they want it pureed somebody wants</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.140" end="00:35:00.890" style="s2">you know vegetables to touch it besides</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.610" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">the tomato it&#39;s clinical in it and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.890" end="00:35:04.040" style="s2">something want no garlic right so</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:07.550" style="s2">there&#39;s you need diversity of options</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.040" end="00:35:10.580" style="s2">and does it make sense in a tomato back</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.550" end="00:35:11.750" style="s2">in to make tomato sauce it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.580" end="00:35:13.910" style="s2">sense to make it individually because</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.750" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">that&#39;s not efficient right or there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.910" end="00:35:16.670" style="s2">reason most of us buy our tomato sauce</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:17.480" style="s2">and we don&#39;t make it from scratch even</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.670" end="00:35:19.210" style="s2">though it tastes really good from</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.480" end="00:35:22.680" style="s2">scratch if you have the right recipe</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.210" end="00:35:25.650" style="s2">having a one big tomato sauce back</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.680" end="00:35:27.570" style="s2">tree in Canada that makes different all</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.650" end="00:35:29.190" style="s2">the different versions would give us</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.570" end="00:35:31.380" style="s2">kind of the best world but like anyway</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.190" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s figuring out the math of how many</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.380" end="00:35:39.720" style="s2">do we need and from the bottom up the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:41.010" style="s2">homes are lost in the sauce yes yes we</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.720" end="00:35:43.170" style="s2">definitely and that&#39;s for like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.010" end="00:35:44.850" style="s2">technology and the tools come in is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.170" end="00:35:46.740" style="s2">you one you don&#39;t figure out how much</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.850" end="00:35:48.810" style="s2">pasta sauce it&#39;s everybody and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.740" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">all lead at how many it&#39;s that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.810" end="00:35:53.370" style="s2">the solution racing or we are coming up</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:56.340" style="s2">with the solution for 10,000 people if</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.370" end="00:35:59.340" style="s2">there were 10,000 people in Canada who</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.340" end="00:36:01.530" style="s2">wanted a brand of pasta sauce that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.340" end="00:36:03.030" style="s2">wanted to use then we would have one</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.530" end="00:36:05.850" style="s2">factory and it would ship out to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.030" end="00:36:08.130" style="s2">everywhere in Canada as we grew we&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.850" end="00:36:11.820" style="s2">oh you know what each factory is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.130" end="00:36:13.770" style="s2">big and it can it can make ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.820" end="00:36:15.930" style="s2">or surpass today how about like that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.770" end="00:36:17.400" style="s2">figure out the map for when does it make</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.930" end="00:36:19.350" style="s2">sense of a second one where does it make</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.400" end="00:36:20.610" style="s2">sense to put that second line and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.350" end="00:36:22.830" style="s2">it can you can grow from there because</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.610" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">if you if you&#39;re in Australia you want</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.830" end="00:36:25.950" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make sense to ship it from</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:28.080" style="s2">here but you actually since it&#39;s not for</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.950" end="00:36:31.530" style="s2">profit since it&#39;s owned by all of us not</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.080" end="00:36:33.090" style="s2">just Canadians it&#39;s open source so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.530" end="00:36:35.430" style="s2">tell you how to start a tomato factory</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.090" end="00:36:36.930" style="s2">in Australia you have 10,000 people you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.430" end="00:36:38.670" style="s2">need to have 10,000 people first find</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.930" end="00:36:42.090" style="s2">her ten thousand people who like pasta</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.670" end="00:36:43.260" style="s2">sauce and so creating the databases and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.090" end="00:36:46.140" style="s2">the ability to share that information</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.260" end="00:36:48.510" style="s2">and be able to create a system together</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.140" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">is what I&#39;m trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.510" end="00:36:52.740" style="s2">do in the world is how not because</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:55.230" style="s2">anything can be solved basically what</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.740" end="00:36:57.660" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 or sorry to</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.230" end="00:37:01.140" style="s2">solve this wrong word anything can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.660" end="00:37:02.850" style="s2">made extremely better by having 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.140" end="00:37:06.120" style="s2">people $100,000 working on it because it</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.850" end="00:37:07.890" style="s2">also I don&#39;t need you to agree on what</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.120" end="00:37:09.540" style="s2">my ten thousand people are doing if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.890" end="00:37:11.310" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be part of it you can go</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.540" end="00:37:12.570" style="s2">start your own 10,000 people right so if</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.310" end="00:37:14.370" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to figure out pasta sauce</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.570" end="00:37:16.260" style="s2">we&#39;ve somehow found 10,000 people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.370" end="00:37:18.390" style="s2">like pureed vegetable pasta sauce and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.260" end="00:37:19.860" style="s2">that&#39;s all we&#39;re concentrating on if</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.390" end="00:37:21.480" style="s2">you&#39;re someone who likes chunky pasta</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.860" end="00:37:24.000" style="s2">sauce you wouldn&#39;t come be a part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.480" end="00:37:25.590" style="s2">that or if we started out a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.000" end="00:37:27.510" style="s2">and we found out 99 percent of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.590" end="00:37:29.100" style="s2">like pureed and only 1 percent of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.510" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">like the other one we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.100" end="00:37:33.060" style="s2">concentrate on the 90 91 but you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">you&#39;re the 1% how do we find you your</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.060" end="00:37:35.690" style="s2">ninth</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:39.260" style="s2">you know people so you also get your</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.690" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">your thing that you want and it might</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.260" end="00:37:43.099" style="s2">make sense if I think I&#39;ll probably be</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:45.140" style="s2">more off this away like 1% of people at</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.099" end="00:37:49.549" style="s2">what Puri passes laws that has all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.140" end="00:37:51.650" style="s2">vegetables in it but having um the one</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.549" end="00:37:54.980" style="s2">that is the 1% that only people want</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.650" end="00:37:56.869" style="s2">yeah that one being I&#39;m okay if that one</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.980" end="00:37:58.369" style="s2">goes down we can have one factory making</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.869" end="00:38:00.049" style="s2">that in the world and it shipped so and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.369" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">they give the ship the shipping itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.049" end="00:38:04.520" style="s2">has to be put into the math as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:07.460" style="s2">right there&#39;s a real true cost to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.520" end="00:38:10.819" style="s2">in energy and time and we can only make</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.460" end="00:38:12.650" style="s2">that so efficient even with extremely</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.819" end="00:38:14.210" style="s2">renewable energy there&#39;s still a time</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.650" end="00:38:16.430" style="s2">like involved there&#39;s still that like</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.210" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">the nutrients are slightly last by it by</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.430" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">it moving especially with actual produce</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:22.940" style="s2">and so having the math there and having</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:24.680" style="s2">it be modular granular equals modular I</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.940" end="00:38:27.829" style="s2">don&#39;t know I can&#39;t read that one better</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.680" end="00:38:30.619" style="s2">the other one first yes yes yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.829" end="00:38:33.710" style="s2">modular so that like but I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.619" end="00:38:35.210" style="s2">having a franchise system or instead of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.710" end="00:38:37.460" style="s2">you want to McDonald&#39;s and you happen to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.210" end="00:38:39.410" style="s2">be exactly like McDonald&#39;s it&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.460" end="00:38:41.299" style="s2">an open source model right we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.410" end="00:38:43.220" style="s2">hey you want to start a burger</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.299" end="00:38:45.109" style="s2">restaurant these places started to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.220" end="00:38:47.869" style="s2">burger restaurant and here&#39;s how you do</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.109" end="00:38:50.599" style="s2">it with with the employees being paid</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.869" end="00:38:52.250" style="s2">well here&#39;s how you like here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.599" end="00:38:55.160" style="s2">different iterations and when we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.250" end="00:38:57.770" style="s2">that process it&#39;s very hard to compete</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.160" end="00:39:00.440" style="s2">with that in the outside world in what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.770" end="00:39:02.329" style="s2">call what what I call gave me I invented</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.440" end="00:39:06.319" style="s2">that what we call game a like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.329" end="00:39:07.549" style="s2">current I didn&#39;t know did not create</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.319" end="00:39:10.849" style="s2">that but like what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.549" end="00:39:12.349" style="s2">capitalism which some people think is</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.849" end="00:39:17.299" style="s2">not the definition it&#39;s like everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.349" end="00:39:19.279" style="s2">up to this point is giving hey Nick good</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.299" end="00:39:20.569" style="s2">vibes to you to Nick he just wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.279" end="00:39:22.190" style="s2">getting part of this I had quite the fun</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.569" end="00:39:25.490" style="s2">exchange this morning with somebody on</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.190" end="00:39:27.109" style="s2">gave me it was it was he said I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.490" end="00:39:29.599" style="s2">have agency because I&#39;m not a man this</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.109" end="00:39:32.180" style="s2">is basically what he said for real</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.599" end="00:39:33.910" style="s2">these days but so we started out this</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.180" end="00:39:39.319" style="s2">this my class thanks for stopping by</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.910" end="00:39:41.869" style="s2">your work is much appreciated but I</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.319" end="00:39:46.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know us or was that agency</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.869" end="00:39:48.299" style="s2">granular modular that having option</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.890" end="00:39:49.890" style="s2">for every city that aren&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.299" end="00:39:51.779" style="s2">the same in every one is it not going to</p>

<p begin="00:41:45.779" end="00:41:49.259" style="s2">that and give them another another</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.259" end="00:41:53.609" style="s2">come join Nick I&#39;m only on for another</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.809" end="00:41:58.920" style="s2">19 minutes so I have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.609" end="00:42:00.029" style="s2">Jordan in 45 minutes but the idea is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.920" end="00:42:00.420" style="s2">doing this every day</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.029" end="00:42:03.510" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.420" end="00:42:05.400" style="s2">to 9:30 in my time so that&#39;s I&#39;m down</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.510" end="00:42:07.890" style="s2">for 42 minutes so 42 minutes ago is when</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.400" end="00:42:09.269" style="s2">I go live and I would love other people</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.890" end="00:42:10.260" style="s2">to join me at this time</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.269" end="00:42:11.220" style="s2">it&#39;s so much easier having a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.260" end="00:42:12.510" style="s2">conversation with someone and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.220" end="00:42:15.660" style="s2">interacting with the comments rather</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.510" end="00:42:17.880" style="s2">than doing this by myself which I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.660" end="00:42:22.289" style="s2">the best at the talking to the camera</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.880" end="00:42:24.359" style="s2">god better I&#39;ve had practice but yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.289" end="00:42:26.690" style="s2">close to building upon onedrive already</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.359" end="00:42:26.690" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.099" end="00:42:32.309" style="s2">building a Pomodoro exists and not just</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.390" end="00:42:33.960" style="s2">and the issue is though like yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.309" end="00:42:39.180" style="s2">build on what already exists but it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.960" end="00:42:40.890" style="s2">broken that capitalism is or game a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.180" end="00:42:43.019" style="s2">whatever you want to call it is I</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.890" end="00:42:45.329" style="s2">attribute it&#39;s like the the house and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.019" end="00:42:47.579" style="s2">the Weasleys it&#39;s held up by magic like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.329" end="00:42:49.410" style="s2">it&#39;s someone you can think back to her</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.579" end="00:42:51.809" style="s2">our time as hunter-gatherers where our</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.410" end="00:42:53.460" style="s2">life was much more simple and then as we</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.809" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">grew bigger we need more complexity we</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.460" end="00:42:58.380" style="s2">needed kind of a central leader and key</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:43:00.089" style="s2">this our economic system that has come</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.380" end="00:43:02.130" style="s2">up is basically the reason I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.089" end="00:43:03.510" style="s2">Lisa&#39;s house is that instead of central</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.130" end="00:43:05.730" style="s2">planning which is communism which has</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.510" end="00:43:07.430" style="s2">its own home box who really kind of suck</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.730" end="00:43:10.259" style="s2">at central planning as a species</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.430" end="00:43:12.539" style="s2">capitalism game a has been there ad hoc</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.259" end="00:43:13.890" style="s2">solutions so it&#39;s like I have a vision</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.539" end="00:43:16.109" style="s2">of something I want to create in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.890" end="00:43:17.990" style="s2">world I want to maximize my profit so</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.109" end="00:43:21.539" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna lie I&#39;m gonna or just be</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.990" end="00:43:24.900" style="s2">blinders to the truth so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.539" end="00:43:26.430" style="s2">maximize that right so that everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.900" end="00:43:28.650" style="s2">we do within that system creates</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.430" end="00:43:30.210" style="s2">externalities good and bad and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.650" end="00:43:33.000" style="s2">up to the next person to solve the its</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.210" end="00:43:34.920" style="s2">value so my vision of the world like my</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.000" end="00:43:36.990" style="s2">idea for a business creates new problems</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.920" end="00:43:39.839" style="s2">that somebody else solves and then we</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.990" end="00:43:41.940" style="s2">have this very extremely complex system</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.839" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">that like when one piece Falls the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.940" end="00:43:46.289" style="s2">thing Falls and because it&#39;s like oh god</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:47.579" style="s2">if they don&#39;t have insurance then we all</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.289" end="00:43:50.180" style="s2">this stuff is based on having insurance</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.579" end="00:43:52.680" style="s2">so the insurance went out because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.180" end="00:43:54.269" style="s2">yeah maybe you want to join me tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.680" end="00:43:58.670" style="s2">but I won&#39;t give you the link I will</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.269" end="00:43:58.670" style="s2">send you the link in in a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.590" end="00:44:13.950" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna want to stay up longer and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.640" end="00:44:20.250" style="s2">can&#39;t fifty minutes all right I sent you</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.950" end="00:44:21.840" style="s2">the link on Facebook and so at the ad</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.250" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">hoc solutions and so it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.840" end="00:44:26.730" style="s2">necessarily like dismantle e in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:28.320" style="s2">house it&#39;s about figuring out what is</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.730" end="00:44:31.290" style="s2">keeping it up because it&#39;s not magic and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.320" end="00:44:32.790" style="s2">then what like right now with Cove in</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.290" end="00:44:34.740" style="s2">nineteen what we need to be figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.790" end="00:44:36.540" style="s2">what our governments are doing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.740" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">job they can do it figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.540" end="00:44:43.050" style="s2">mitigate that that stress increases the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:44.820" style="s2">tools the masks and the the respirators</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.050" end="00:44:45.930" style="s2">and everything else is like we need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.820" end="00:44:48.260" style="s2">be figuring out how we&#39;re going to feed</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.930" end="00:44:50.490" style="s2">ourselves in six months to a year and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.260" end="00:44:52.290" style="s2">there&#39;s very little we can do on an</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.490" end="00:44:54.690" style="s2">individual basis I can grow a garden out</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.290" end="00:44:56.220" style="s2">my yard but if people are hungry they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.690" end="00:44:58.860" style="s2">gonna come eat it there&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.220" end="00:45:01.860" style="s2">actually gonna have access to labor in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.860" end="00:45:03.960" style="s2">if everybody in Vancouver is guerilla</p>

<p begin="00:49:11.339" end="00:49:14.579" style="s2">like it brings up every it brings up</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.289" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.579" end="00:49:20.669" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m realizing more and more to</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:24.439" style="s2">what degree these energy or bias towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.669" end="00:49:31.199" style="s2">action which you know this manic energy</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.439" end="00:49:35.880" style="s2">is actually a way to hide or avoid</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.199" end="00:49:37.229" style="s2">certain feelings of sadness or difficult</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.880" end="00:49:39.479" style="s2">feelings in general you know like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.229" end="00:49:41.489" style="s2">and it&#39;s weird because it feels good</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.479" end="00:49:43.259" style="s2">right but it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.489" end="00:49:45.749" style="s2">effective right it&#39;s like need to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.259" end="00:49:47.579" style="s2">something that these days and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.749" end="00:49:50.639" style="s2">mean if I was completely in that state a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.579" end="00:49:55.289" style="s2">couple of weeks ago and I had to slow</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.639" end="00:49:58.949" style="s2">down and just take a step back and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.289" end="00:50:01.259" style="s2">think many I I don&#39;t know you might have</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.949" end="00:50:04.649" style="s2">a similar kind of character that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.259" end="00:50:06.299" style="s2">always like oriented towards building</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.649" end="00:50:11.219" style="s2">like in a constructive mode you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.299" end="00:50:12.839" style="s2">like and I certainly have that and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.219" end="00:50:15.449" style="s2">know this is what I&#39;ve been learning</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.839" end="00:50:21.359" style="s2">like this year did that is manic energy</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.449" end="00:50:26.669" style="s2">has its downside and sometimes the right</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.359" end="00:50:29.819" style="s2">thing is not to do but I suffer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.669" end="00:50:33.029" style="s2">painful no and it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.819" end="00:50:34.679" style="s2">nothing and it&#39;s hard to like I my</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.029" end="00:50:36.239" style="s2">nervous system shuts down when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.679" end="00:50:37.469" style="s2">under stress and all I can do is sleep</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.239" end="00:50:40.019" style="s2">and I think the world would experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.469" end="00:50:40.690" style="s2">that in that right now we&#39;re like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.019" end="00:50:42.490" style="s2">going through this</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.690" end="00:50:44.920" style="s2">collective trauma that&#39;s like people</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.490" end="00:50:48.550" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to do right like you you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.920" end="00:50:52.359" style="s2">can this isn&#39;t a war and yet it is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.550" end="00:50:53.890" style="s2">the enemy is invisible and most of us</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.359" end="00:50:55.150" style="s2">have very little we can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.890" end="00:50:56.829" style="s2">right like I&#39;m not gonna come up with</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.150" end="00:50:58.569" style="s2">the vaccine I&#39;m not gonna come up with</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.829" end="00:51:01.660" style="s2">how to fold the protein even with my</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.569" end="00:51:04.569" style="s2">biology background but I maybe can come</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.660" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">up with a system to help nurses if their</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.569" end="00:51:07.750" style="s2">house is clean right like there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:09.670" style="s2">things that could be being done that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.750" end="00:51:10.810" style="s2">to support those people who are on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.670" end="00:51:12.280" style="s2">frontline and then dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.810" end="00:51:14.530" style="s2">things that are happening six months to</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.280" end="00:51:15.609" style="s2">a year down the road the people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.530" end="00:51:17.290" style="s2">even want to deal with because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.609" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">food in the supermarket I&#39;m like but is</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.290" end="00:51:22.210" style="s2">there food at the supermarket in six</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:23.770" style="s2">months to a year like this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.210" end="00:51:26.349" style="s2">need to be dealing with is making sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.770" end="00:51:27.819" style="s2">that whatever is truly important in our</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.349" end="00:51:29.859" style="s2">society is still being made because</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.819" end="00:51:31.329" style="s2">we&#39;ve made it right we haven&#39;t left it</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.859" end="00:51:35.319" style="s2">up to the other as you can see they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.329" end="00:51:37.000" style="s2">like to me this is an amazing crisis</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.319" end="00:51:40.119" style="s2">because it&#39;s both like a baby apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.000" end="00:51:42.819" style="s2">where it&#39;s actually fairly benign yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.119" end="00:51:44.380" style="s2">not it&#39;s like the virus itself only</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.819" end="00:51:46.329" style="s2">kills 1% of people and we&#39;re reacting</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.380" end="00:51:47.800" style="s2">I&#39;m really impressed that we&#39;re all stay</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.329" end="00:51:49.510" style="s2">home during this that it&#39;s not how I</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.800" end="00:51:52.030" style="s2">thought society would react to this I</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.510" end="00:51:54.630" style="s2">thought we&#39;d be like 1% who cares the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.030" end="00:51:57.550" style="s2">economy has got to keep chugging on I am</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.630" end="00:51:59.260" style="s2">astounded that this is happening and yet</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.550" end="00:51:59.950" style="s2">at the same time that brings up a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.260" end="00:52:01.300" style="s2">like okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.950" end="00:52:03.460" style="s2">now the world&#39;s ready and we gotta go</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.300" end="00:52:05.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s manic energy and many</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.460" end="00:52:08.020" style="s2">technology absolutely comes in a cost</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.380" end="00:52:10.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s like okay this timeline didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.020" end="00:52:12.819" style="s2">change it&#39;s like we need to we do need</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.900" end="00:52:14.530" style="s2">to wrap it make everything more rapid</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.819" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">and yet at the same time if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.530" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">that energy you actually can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:21.069" style="s2">anything so it is it&#39;s like okay taking</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">the time to call making sure I&#39;m like if</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.069" end="00:52:27.220" style="s2">ever I needed to meditate daily no it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.160" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">the time I&#39;ve always had the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.220" end="00:52:31.329" style="s2">something home and now my kids home but</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:34.990" style="s2">like to deal with that to deal with all</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.329" end="00:52:37.810" style="s2">of it like collective meditation episode</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.990" end="00:52:39.160" style="s2">on your own tell is I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.810" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">best things we can be doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.160" end="00:52:43.569" style="s2">and I feel like I do need to take action</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:45.130" style="s2">and so this is this is what I&#39;m doing I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.569" end="00:52:47.109" style="s2">was doing it at a much different time</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.130" end="00:52:49.750" style="s2">but my brain turns off by the evening of</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.109" end="00:52:50.980" style="s2">his unit at 6:00 p.m. but this is now</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.750" end="00:52:52.690" style="s2">the time that I&#39;m gonna be doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.980" end="00:52:54.000" style="s2">only day two you know it says day four</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.690" end="00:52:57.270" style="s2">because I did - at 6 p.m. and</p>

<p begin="00:53:57.390" end="00:54:04.980" style="s2">it&#39;s almost too much meaning and like</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:10.410" style="s2">more meaning than that then one can</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.980" end="00:54:12.690" style="s2">handle in a way and but I was sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.410" end="00:54:14.100" style="s2">have many kind of trains of thoughts at</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.690" end="00:54:15.000" style="s2">the moment I wanted to ask you like see</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.100" end="00:54:18.660" style="s2">you&#39;re great to talk to</p>

<p begin="00:54:18.660" end="00:54:21.500" style="s2">meeting to reach out to him for a while</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.860" end="00:54:24.900" style="s2">but I always assume that he&#39;s super busy</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.500" end="00:54:27.000" style="s2">and he is super busy but I was he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.900" end="00:54:28.310" style="s2">like a link for you on Thursday and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.000" end="00:54:30.570" style="s2">we made a disappointment on Monday</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.310" end="00:54:32.820" style="s2">because I talked to him only one other</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.570" end="00:54:35.100" style="s2">time and that was when I first remember</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.820" end="00:54:37.260" style="s2">it&#39;s that conversation it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.100" end="00:54:40.140" style="s2">time I can actual conversation with him</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.260" end="00:54:43.380" style="s2">and so much has changed in six months</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.140" end="00:54:45.960" style="s2">that I just want maybe you feel okay now</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.380" end="00:54:47.490" style="s2">is the time to do each other part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.960" end="00:54:48.840" style="s2">he&#39;s like what are we talking about I</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.490" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know like it&#39;s not like I need his</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.840" end="00:54:51.810" style="s2">specific opinion on something I just</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:53.700" style="s2">kind of want to tell him what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.810" end="00:54:55.710" style="s2">up to in this space and I want to hear I</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.700" end="00:54:57.270" style="s2">know I think he has his own idea that</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.710" end="00:54:59.790" style="s2">he&#39;s working towards but it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.270" end="00:55:01.740" style="s2">like ready for public consumption but it</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.790" end="00:55:03.330" style="s2">was brought to our attention and like</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.740" end="00:55:05.100" style="s2">ego making a conversation by someone who</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.330" end="00:55:07.350" style="s2">didn&#39;t know it wasn&#39;t for public</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.100" end="00:55:09.570" style="s2">and so I want to kind of talk to him</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.350" end="00:55:12.540" style="s2">about that if he&#39;s open to it but I just</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.570" end="00:55:14.280" style="s2">find out how he&#39;s doing in this time</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.540" end="00:55:16.140" style="s2">period but they posted something on his</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.280" end="00:55:19.080" style="s2">Facebook which was like needing to take</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.140" end="00:55:20.190" style="s2">action and that the basis of what I</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.080" end="00:55:21.660" style="s2">interpreted eyes it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.190" end="00:55:24.660" style="s2">government&#39;s not going to solve this we</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.660" end="00:55:28.080" style="s2">involve it and it&#39;s always a nobody has</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.660" end="00:55:30.560" style="s2">30 I was like hey I am like I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.080" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">with the solution raising specifically</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.560" end="00:55:37.110" style="s2">working in that things in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:38.850" style="s2">think it is powerful like to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.110" end="00:55:41.850" style="s2">bring people together for a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.850" end="00:55:43.170" style="s2">and generate a solution even a solution</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.850" end="00:55:46.260" style="s2">raising isn&#39;t perfect which of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.170" end="00:55:47.790" style="s2">it&#39;s not how does this move forward so</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.260" end="00:55:50.220" style="s2">there are more people on board and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.790" end="00:55:51.980" style="s2">there&#39;s also like another traveler we</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.220" end="00:55:53.820" style="s2">are bringing people together for</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.980" end="00:55:55.230" style="s2">hopefully so they can bring their</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.820" end="00:55:57.630" style="s2">projects and we can create something</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.230" end="00:56:00.090" style="s2">that helps all of our projects but that</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.630" end="00:56:01.560" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been as a Racine age as well and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.090" end="00:56:03.990" style="s2">it&#39;s just that like in the gaming space</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.560" end="00:56:05.250" style="s2">I have put out a ton of stuff that some</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.990" end="00:56:07.020" style="s2">of its pristine flow and some of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.250" end="00:56:09.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t and I can&#39;t know which what is and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.020" end="00:56:10.410" style="s2">what isn&#39;t and so part of why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.000" end="00:56:12.720" style="s2">doing together attacking another project</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.410" end="00:56:16.290" style="s2">was that one of the things that got the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.720" end="00:56:18.270" style="s2">most interest was asking people what</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.290" end="00:56:20.100" style="s2">their projects right and being a project</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.270" end="00:56:21.360" style="s2">for easy and everyone&#39;s like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.100" end="00:56:22.350" style="s2">don&#39;t want a project for eighteen but</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.360" end="00:56:24.120" style="s2">people don&#39;t necessarily want to come</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.350" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2">and read other people&#39;s projects and</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.120" end="00:56:27.840" style="s2">everyone thinks their ideas is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.640" end="00:56:29.460" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna save the world but no one</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.840" end="00:56:30.840" style="s2">kind of wants to like let go of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.460" end="00:56:32.670" style="s2">a straight something else and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.840" end="00:56:36.420" style="s2">okay so how can we work from that space</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.670" end="00:56:38.460" style="s2">but then we finally had last Saturday we</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.420" end="00:56:42.470" style="s2">had other people join us or it was just</p>

<p begin="00:56:43.790" end="00:56:50.010" style="s2">like that approach you know it&#39;s fart</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.850" end="00:56:53.850" style="s2">basically right like it&#39;s this instead</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.010" end="00:56:55.950" style="s2">of resisting that things aren&#39;t the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.850" end="00:56:57.690" style="s2">you expect them you would like them to</p>
