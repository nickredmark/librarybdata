<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">what has been my journey in this i</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:47.439" style="s2">started off as a boy growing up on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:51.520" style="s2">farm</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.439" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">you know in rural australia um and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.520" end="00:01:54.799" style="s2">we we had a fairly interesting situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.799" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">our extended family joined together and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.600" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">uh as a collective purchased uh several</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.600" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">farms so there was five families</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:08.720" style="s2">um that would come together and as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">result we</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.720" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">you know we would move from farm to farm</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">over the year um a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">nomadic gypsies</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">um to to essentially be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:24.560" style="s2">harvest of each one and we built</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">up um the most southern ranging uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.560" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">uh organic avocado farm in australia</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">um until that time no one had planted uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">avocado trees as fast health as my</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.680" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">grandparents had</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">planted and my parents and aunties and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">uncle and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">uh so that was you know i guess i was</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">introduced to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">sort of innovation on the land at an</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">early age um</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">you know from when i was born we were so</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">i grew up in that environment um of sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">of innovation on the land and uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">it was a very very dry environment uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">the organic</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">avocado uh portraits and uh so we had to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">do a lot of innovation</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">you know the first kind of shelter belts</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">um the first kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">uh drip irrigation systems um you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">this was in the in the 70s when i was</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">growing up there</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:16.959" style="s2">the late 70s and um early 80s so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">so that was my sort of introduction and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.959" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">then we started growing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">kiwi fruit up in the mountainous region</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">on a coast which was very wet and almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">tropical um in its rainfall pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">uh we had every deadly uh species known</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">to a human kind on that surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">like just completely wild</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">uh country you know beautiful we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">sort of right in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">national park essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">up on a mountain and it turned out that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">mountain was actually very very sacred</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">to the local</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">first nation um and so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">would work uh the fields uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">work our kiwi vines with um local</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">indigenous communities who we took</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">on into our collective farm as</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">and the sort of super flat structures we</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">had was</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">quite interesting for them um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">they kind of encouraged us to come into</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">their world a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">and so we got introduced at a young age</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">the traditional ways of being and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">knowing that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">uh had in their lives their worldview</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">their spirituality and cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">and so we kind of took a bit of a dive</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">their world literally um we got taken to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">um these beautiful sacred waterholes</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">up in the mountains which are</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">traditionally used</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">for teaching so they&#39;re teaching sites</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">where essentially boys become men and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">generally the the trial that you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">put through is that you know you will uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">you know get fully painted up go through</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">the traditional corroboree</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">which is essentially reenacting the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">cosmology of that region and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">cosmos universe everything um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">you then sort of over a period of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">several weeks you&#39;ll wind your way</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">through the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">following the waterways all the way up</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">to the source</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">now the source of where the water is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">coming from that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">where they believe their ancestors are</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">all living there</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">um and so the act when you get there</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">you you&#39;re covered in pain still as</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">most of it&#39;s fallen off it&#39;s okay uh you</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">get there um</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">you go through ceremony and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">essentially dive</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">you it&#39;s i call it the world&#39;s oldest</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">uh waterfall like slippery dip in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">world like it was australia being one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">ancient continents around</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">this rock is just ancient basalt you</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">know smooth as</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">maybe like four meters and you get into</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">this giant pool</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">which is where the ancestors live there</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">and and the last bit of ochre that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">your body which is kind of x-ray vision</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">sort of dissolves</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">into the ancestor pool and you you come</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:19.840" style="s2">out and you&#39;re now a man when you come</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">so so we started going to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">site uh when i was just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">very small uh like a toddler actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:51.759" style="s2">was when i first started going to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:54.400" style="s2">site as a child</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">and then as you get older and older uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.400" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">um and i didn&#39;t go through the entire</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">ceremony that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">um i went through a fairly limited</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">ceremony with</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">um you know the elders are only able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">take you so far um as they&#39;re um</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">authorized by the rest of their first</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">nation so we went through a limited</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">ceremony of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">of that though and it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:23.680" style="s2">incredible um</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">um to experience and um</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.680" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">they used to be called dreaming camps uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">held by elder that you know we would</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">learn the songs</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">of all of the the uh different species</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">so we would learn the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">the name of uh the species and how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">sing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">and so when you sing it you walk along</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">the rivers and you renew the song lines</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">uh and so you know that the species in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">very intimate way that you you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:50.960" style="s2">say the true name um and you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">very ancient</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very unique um so getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">living in that bio region and um and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">enmeshed within that gift gave me a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">perspective that was much bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">one that um you know that um</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">this by design i guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">they brought us into that environment</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:20.879" style="s2">and so when we were 11</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">uh years old we we went through the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.879" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">the ceremony of finding your uh your</p>

<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">of australia from a white man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">perspective how do i</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.160" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">because i i really understood economics</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">in a really good way and i got</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:17.279" style="s2">all the straight a&#39;s and all everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">and i</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">creative side but</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">i ended up going into banking and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">finance um</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2">and thinking well that is the the best</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">way to try and influence things is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">taking that approach</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">but i quickly got into it as an 18 year</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">old i thought wow this is really really</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">and um you know that&#39;s where i really</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">started deepening</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">into permaculture so in youtube i</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">finished my degree in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">i went over to europe as a intern for</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">the zero emissions</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">research and initiative which was uh set</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:02.140" style="s2">up by</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">crowley yeah i didn&#39;t know so</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.140" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">yeah so that was like a six month</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">journey uh with them</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:13.120" style="s2">you know there was a a three-story giant</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:15.760" style="s2">bamboo pavilion was built</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">in germany on the expo in hanover when</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.760" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">when they brought them</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">yes yeah wonderful yeah actually now i</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">do remember that you did tell me when</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">you were here</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">yeah so so that was a great journey</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.880" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">and that&#39;s where i met a key mentor</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">george chan professor george chan</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">was a key mentor and so my job there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">essentially help gather all of the data</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">all of the intellectual capital and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:41.200" style="s2">knowledge that had been built</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">up uh in the network of zuri scientists</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.200" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">condensed it down into a cd-rom back in</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">a mini city room back in those days in</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">2000 like</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">city miniseries was cutting edge so we</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">we put it all down into a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">storybook um</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">and then we published some some</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">children&#39;s fables and stories about</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:12:59.760" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">you know how can i be the strongest tree</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.760" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">in the forest uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">illustrating interconnectivity um</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">i thought he did that later when he was</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">in cortiba the the series because i love</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">i read them to my daughter the six books</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">yeah so so so in 2000 we prototyped like</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">the very first one</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">so that was like a prototype of like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">first like</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">how can i be the strongest tree in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">forest was like</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">the first effort and when we put it uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">you know we just</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">took all illustrations worth put into</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">the city rom and like this is for</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">children we also got a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">about integrated farming systems like</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">how do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">have super intensive polycultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">farming from you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">combining not just permaculture but</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">integrated farming systems from asia</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">which are</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">super productive you know uh and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">professor george</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">chan he was the guy who you know he was</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">a head</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">environmental engineer of mauritius</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">actually who basically set up all of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:13:59.360" style="s2">wastewater</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">and biogas systems and mauritius to kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.360" end="00:14:02.480" style="s2">of you know ensure that they would</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">protect their</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.480" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">uh marine ecosystems uh and this was in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">the 60s like super early on</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">um and uh so then</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">he sort of graduated on and on and after</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">he um he spent a lot of time in china</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">and southern china about</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">super intensive systems and he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">introduced me into</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">integrated farming systems which was i</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">guess you can say super intensive</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">polyculture</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">tropical style uh farming in southeast</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">asia and asia</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">east asia so that kind of gave me a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">systems view on permaculture and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">we were learning industrial ecology from</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">people like emery lovins came and taught</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">us and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">you know about first principles design</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">and we did some cool projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">with some german beer factories turning</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">you know spent grain into bread and uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">growing mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">oyster mushrooms to make them into</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">mushroom sausages um</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">you know this was all like when you said</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">emory lovins came and taught</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">us um is this within zeri or what</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.839" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">organization was us</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">at that point yes okay yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">with siri yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">so so i was basically an intern slash</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.959" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.519" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">deputy uh technical manager of azeri for</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">six months and so yeah set up their web</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">systems and their</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">education systems and and then as as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:22.399" style="s2">result we got</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">like they would bring in teachers to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:25.839" style="s2">essentially that was part of the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">like you got an education</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">in systems to design for six months like</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">a living experience of systems design</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">uh with you know just the the best</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">thought leaders</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">on the planet at that time you know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">we could get access to so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:42.639" style="s2">like deep dive and literally when i say</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">deep dive</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.639" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">uh we had we were piping in whale love</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">songs</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">from off the coast of south america</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">through a little microphone</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">that was designed based on the design on</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">a whale&#39;s um ear is is structured</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">and so the way whale&#39;s ear is structured</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">so i learned biomimicry</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:06.959" style="s2">there and um yeah these whale songs were</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">being piped in by a mobile phone in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.959" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">little buoy</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">and the microphone was designed exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">like a whale&#39;s ear to listen to whale</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">songs and they were piping them 24 7</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:18.959" style="s2">over to germany so that we could hear</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">whale love songs</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.959" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">and you know people would walk into our</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">gigantic three-story sort of bamboo</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">pavilion and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:31.279" style="s2">and you know this this sound we&#39;d say oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">it&#39;s whales making love you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">coast of south america</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">you know um and it would</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">you know bring a laugh but it was just</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">so cool like in year 2000 that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">pretty breakthrough biomimicry</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">sort of explaining how does biomimicry</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">work like as a design science so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">kind of led me into</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">deeper into and i edited george chan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:52.240" style="s2">book um</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">called integrated farming and waste</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.240" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">management systems that was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">published by fao</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">but we needed to get a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">new pictures</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">um for fao to publish it and it became a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">little bit difficult so</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">it didn&#39;t happen but um you know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">kind of gave me the context for</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">did my and i was teaching permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">uh darren doherty and david holmgren</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">yeah down in victoria we would teach</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">together in bendigo</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.880" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">uh with the permaculture research</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">institute to kind of make it official</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">learn a bit more about some of the large</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">scale earthworks uh and subtropical</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">system that um that jeff was doing in</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s just a massive uh you know massive</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">uh well what can i say it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">grasslands project</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">it was a step project you know it was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:08.320" style="s2">massive scale and that was a five-year</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">project and i was there for one year of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">that five years</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">uh building the educational information</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">training up</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">everyone from ministry staff right</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">through to farm extension offices in</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">villages so</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">my highlight there was building a lunar</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">calendar</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">for 40 million farmers that um</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">that had like monthly tips like this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:32.000" style="s2">when you should do your compost</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">you know this is when you should be um</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.000" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">planting this when you should be</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">grafting walnut trees</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">you know apricots etc you know just and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">we found out that if we didn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:41.840" style="s2">super simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">and lunar calendar they were just like</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.840" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">going to use it for their</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">evening fire to cook their meals on like</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">in these villages so we</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.160" style="s2">i sort of learned a lot from that how</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">did you integrate</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.160" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">local specificity and knowledge with all</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">these other techniques in the in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">calendar because i&#39;m sure that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">that some of the knowledge must have</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">been their own knowledge um</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">integrated exactly</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">it was yeah they were deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">knowledgeable</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">uh pockets of people who knew everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">there was to know</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">about um you know ecological agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">and so we did a lot of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">design uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">sessions across six major regions um it</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">was like 18.7</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.120" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">million hectares like the of coverage</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">just huge areas so we would have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">travel for days at a time</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">after in mongolia plateau you know past</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">the great wall</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">and then back down onto the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">plains and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">you know that we would basically gather</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:49.120" style="s2">this like participatory information</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">um it was mainly run by extremely</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.120" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">talented</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">uh women facilitators who would gather</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">up the women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">development association uh and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">gathered a lot of their information</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">from the women from the ground up about</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">what do you do this week what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">next week and what do you do and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">are your techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">so there it was like they were basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">cultural anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">uh employed by aussie um to kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">understand all that local context</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:20.080" style="s2">through deep interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">um so the first year was basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.080" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">participation management and then by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">time i got there</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">um it was then participatory management</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:29.679" style="s2">let&#39;s plan together</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">about like what do you need next what do</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.679" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">you need next to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">you know improve your water management</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:35.919" style="s2">and uh how to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">increase your productivity whilst</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.919" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">increasing you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:42.000" style="s2">biodiversity soil fertility water</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">holding capacity because</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.000" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">we were there because there was a water</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">crisis all the rivers had been</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">completely extracted all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">shallow and medium aquifers were</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">completely depleted so all they had left</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.960" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">was deep deep ground water</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:56.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s the very last bit of water</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">you&#39;re ever going to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.400" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">because it takes a long time to recharge</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">and the rivers are all dried up so what</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.240" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">are you going to do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">you have to make a really good water</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">budget and have to plan for that so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">were then going through participatory</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">water budgeting</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">at the level of the village and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">feeding that back up to the ministry to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">like saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">you know you need to like set some water</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.960" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">budgets or you&#39;re gonna run out of water</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">and this was you know um you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:22.559" style="s2">hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">farmers depending on that and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.559" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">the bread basket of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">china so it was pretty serious um</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">uh you know and um the particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">province we were in</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">had some you know needed some uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">technical</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">uh training and you know hydro geology</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">modeling and other things um as well as</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">you know education we went out to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:47.360" style="s2">villages and they would give like</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">you know a one-page brochure just</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">wall-to-wall text</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">zero images now most of the farmers were</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">illiterate and in the 70s so</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">it was just a mismatch and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">about trying to provide some context</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:22:00.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">um capacity building and was this</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.400" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">prior or after you developed this um</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">aqua filter system</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">to for cleaning waste water yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">so i got the inspiration for um</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">developing the aqua biofilter the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">floating wetland system</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">from george chan um in 2000 at ziri</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">uh so that was uh so george</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:24.840" style="s2">when i was you know george was training</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">as you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.840" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">um quite intensively in integrated</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">farming systems and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">systems designed more broadly and he</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">showed us</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">he said you know we had a problem in our</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">fish ponds that there was just too much</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">in there and so he said we started</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">growing rice on top of the fish ponds to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">take up the nutrient and clean the water</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">i was like that&#39;s so cool um but it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">on like very like rough material so they</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">were doing it with bamboos but then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">bamboos would</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:55.919" style="s2">degrade very quickly and you&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">new ones and neurons every year</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.919" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">uh then they there were experiments with</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">polystyrene and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">which of course it was very</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">unsustainable material so</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">i sort of started coming at it from from</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">a design science perspective how can we</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">improve this system</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">and more broadly create an ecological</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">management tool that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">purifies water heals waterways and lakes</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">and restores them to help so</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of how i came to develop</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">the aqua biofilter um</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">and so so when i got back to australia i</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">started developing prototypes of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">and kept in touch with george and some</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">of the other broader network</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">and then um you know got some funding</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">from the australian government</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">to do some trials and then so in 2004</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">when i was actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">in china that&#39;s when we got involved</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">with the broader network</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">with a large trial where we</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">had some input as aqua biofilter and got</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">involved a little bit in some projects</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">there which were</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">a pretty massive scale um</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">and it was the largest aquaponics system</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">in the world was it</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">like i read something yeah i think it</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:05.760" style="s2">was at that at that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">time it was it was it was it was massive</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">it was acres and acres</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">of floating wetlands um so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">yeah it was it was the biggest of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:16.320" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">i mean i know that you you know the work</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.320" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">of john todd who was my second</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">phd supervisor because he also did some</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">um floating</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">wetland systems in in china um</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">around that time or maybe even before</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">that but have you come across</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">by matrix water in scotland um which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">a sort of like my friend</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">and his father-in-law michael shaw um</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">michael shaw used to work with john todd</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">and they then started biomatrix in</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">in scotland and they&#39;re doing wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">work in urban regeneration using</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">floating wetlands and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">active edge technology and um</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">you come across them yeah actually i</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">i think actually yes um definitely and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">remember seeing a post from that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">shared and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">um and actually maybe we did chat about</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:05.200" style="s2">this a couple years ago</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">i think you might have mentioned it then</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.200" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">um but that was quite a while ago but i</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">yes definitely i&#39;m gonna admire what</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">they&#39;ve done like</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">it&#39;s so cool uh you know restoring the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">waterways</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">um so i think we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">similar version of biometrics but you</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">know being very focused on australia</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">and in asia um and a bit on the us</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">um but uh you know i is that company</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">in australia um</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">but um what what is it called because i</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">found one that was called</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">eco plan um that was time yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">so that was a consulting uh company you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">know um</p>

<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">you know a number of years um as an</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:54.799" style="s2">environmental consult planning</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">consultant</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.799" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">this was sort of back from that time of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:01.679" style="s2">2005 when i got back to australia</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">um you know got quite worked as an</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.679" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">environmental planning consultant</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">um mainly for other big consulting firms</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:08.799" style="s2">that would have</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">good contracts with the government to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.799" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">essentially do environmental impact</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">assessments</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:18.960" style="s2">uh habitat protection habitat surveys um</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">and uh yeah is that around the same time</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">where you worked for the public</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">authority and did that integrated</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">building design</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:27.120" style="s2">um and developed the green building</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">council</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.120" end="00:26:33.679" style="s2">um yeah that was in uh that was in two</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">that was in 2009 uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.679" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">that uh that project with the green</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">building so i sort of got quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:41.679" style="s2">involved in environmental consulting and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">i was doing aqua biofilter on the side</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.679" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">um you know when projects and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">opportunities would come up would do</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">and i was working um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">got involved with melbourne water for uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">two years um</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">you know doing some different roles but</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">mainly strategic planning</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">around how do you basically restore</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">entire catchments you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">their their catchment size is 1.3</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">million hectares</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">uh you know drinking water for five six</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">million people</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">uh and so we had to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">essentially develop a water quality</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">model that would improve the health of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">all of the rivers you know um um</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">oh apologies i think i just dropped off</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">there so someone tried to call me</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">um so uh yeah so so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">we so i had a job there um in 2007</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:36.000" style="s2">and uh 2008 which was kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">culmination of my consulting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.000" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">career and environment and uh we</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">developed a thing called the decision</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">support system which was essentially</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">a metrics tool that allowed you to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">informed decisions about where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">invest in your catchment you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">where&#39;s the high biodiversity areas</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">where&#39;s the most pristine waterways</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">and where do you have the most biosignal</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">across your catchments</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:02.320" style="s2">and essentially model that which was not</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">too dissimilar to what i&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.320" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">in china with aussie</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">and then sort of but making it very</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">contextual for the bayer region of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">melbourne&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">water um and you know really hone in on</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:15.720" style="s2">you know what are the decision metrics</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">that power your investment</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.720" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">prioritization</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">so we had a budget of essentially 300</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:22.799" style="s2">million that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">um built up for the better bays and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.799" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">waterways</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.919" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">program that the decision support system</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">informed so that was like a five-year</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">plan</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">that we set up for melbourne water</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">called beta-based waterways</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">and that was in partnership with epa</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.000" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">victoria um and melbourne water</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">so we we basically developed very</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">complex water quality model for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">region</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">and i developed i know i think it was 20</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">or 30 scenarios to 2030 of</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">you know what are all the worst things</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">that could possibly happen to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">your water supply</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">you know you could have fires you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">have pandemics you could have all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">happen and what can you do this is back</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">to invest so that you can avoid all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">those down</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">side scenarios so that was my job to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">envision the worst and then plan for</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">and then try and do the best and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">allocate so it ended up allocating about</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">300 million</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">um to going into paying farmers and land</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">managers to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">uh essentially provide ecosystem you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">know services</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">uh essentially to melbourne water and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">melbourne water&#39;s first stakeholder</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">is the environment the second</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">stakeholder is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">water consumers who need to drink pure</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">water and so the idea is if you if the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">environment is your first stakeholder</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">pure uh drinking water and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">so your second class stakeholder this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">back then in the waterways group that i</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">was part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">that&#39;s that means you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">getting the most pure quality water</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">possible to those people with the least</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">amount of treatment</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">uh the least amount of pollution in</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">there so</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">that was kind of a real pleasure and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">rolled into this thing called eco</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">markets</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">which the department of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">environment then sort of we</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">input a lot of what we&#39;ve been doing at</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:10.240" style="s2">melbourne water into that model</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">um to kind of power the decision metrics</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.240" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">to power the invest public investment</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">um yeah about 300 million and it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">going today and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">even more now i don&#39;t know how many</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">hundreds of millions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s just grown and grown how integrated</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">was that work at the time because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">sounds like it&#39;s a massive bio-regional</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">um project that that looks at water</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">management at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">bioregional scale with this link between</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">city and region like melbourne and its</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">region um but was it was it also</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">integrated with all the other energy</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">water transfer</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">energy transport and building um because</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">you you also worked on some some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">design for a urban neighborhood or what</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">what project you developed yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">oh the big eco neighborhood that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">yeah that was uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">yeah that was kind of when i was working</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">on my sort of environmental planning and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">consulting and yeah we were building</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">permaculture gardens as well on the side</p>

<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">called big eco neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">um where darren darwin you know we</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">actually taught some permaculture design</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">courses with</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">john champagne who&#39;s based there in</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.279" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">big eco neighborhood project came about</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:45.840" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">you know a whole bunch of local people</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.840" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">came together and said well</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">you know we&#39;re all living on separate</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">blocks and we&#39;re all coming into town</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">and buying at our bulk</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">whole foods organic shop and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.760" end="00:31:56.480" style="s2">why don&#39;t we actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of environmental</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.480" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">activism to save some of the ogre forest</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">you know that was um still left</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.840" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">and um you know we got together and said</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:07.039" style="s2">why don&#39;t we actually form an eco</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">neighborhood together</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.039" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">buy some land build a community house</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">make it affordable housing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">let&#39;s do this so</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve sort of found a block of land</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:21.279" style="s2">right on the edge of town</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.600" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">um uh and yeah we bought it for 500 000</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">as a non-profit incorporated association</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">which gives absolutely zero investor</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:29.600" style="s2">protection so this meant everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.600" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">had to trust each other with that sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">of sum of money</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">and that you were gonna everyone&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">do the right thing um</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">and and yeah it worked amazingly you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">know it was just a beautiful experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">and i got involved</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">in the design of the from the very</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">beginning through to um</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">implementation and um yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">thriving neighborhood now of uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">i think it&#39;s about 23 or 24 houses um</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">um or even more because uh one-third of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">the property was sold to a co-housing</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:06.000" style="s2">co-op uh and so sort of uh duplexes were</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">built so sold off some land to them they</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.000" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">then built seven</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">duplexes i think which is um pegged to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">30</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">below market rate and permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">gardens are there and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">the river flows through this we did</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">wetlands restoration project and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">natural swimming pool uh using aqua</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:23.519" style="s2">biofilter kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">technologies and yeah that was a great</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">you know community</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">experience of building community it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">really thriving</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">public authority didn&#39;t you take the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.840" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">this kind of integrated systems designed</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">to i seem to remember something that i</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">found was called the local government</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:47.760" style="s2">urban regeneration project</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">um uh yes so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.760" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">so after i left melbourne water um i</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">got asked basically this municipal</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">government approached me and said look</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">we like the work you&#39;ve been doing about</p>

<p begin="00:34:02.399" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">um you know which is basically going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">build the local community hub</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">you know that is going to have 1 million</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">visitors a year you know that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">be cutting edge sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">green uh you know total water</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">sustainability total</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">energy sustainability so yeah i got</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">involved with that for two years as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">strategic sustainably engineer and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">planner and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">uh you know dive really deep and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">was part of the group called the major</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:33.359" style="s2">projects unit</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">which basically it was a contractor to</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.359" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">all other</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">municipal governments to build whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">they needed you know you need a building</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">will build you need a road and build it</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">you know just</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">it was though too backward municipal</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">governments in australia could still</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">build things</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.280" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">like themselves that was um kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">which is sad that they don&#39;t now but um</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">this is kind of the last one</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">um so so you know so</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">what we did was we um built uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">my role was to help essentially create</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">the first uh green star public green</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">in australia so that was a very great</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">job to be tasked with</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">and um you know it was a 40 million</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">building and i</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">my job was saying okay well where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">budget for green and sustainability and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">they said well we really don&#39;t have one</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">and they said your job is to go find the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">mice so that was that&#39;s what i had to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">so um so we started writing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">grants</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">started meeting a lot of government</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">people and industry people and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">got involved with the green building</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">council and said look we could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">the very first public green building in</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">australia</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">and no rating system exists for that yet</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">so the green building council australia</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">said look it doesn&#39;t exist yet if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">have a green public building you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">create the tool so we said</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">well i&#39;m up for a challenge you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">let&#39;s create the public building tool</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">for the greenville and council australia</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">with our first</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">municipal kind of hub which is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:58.320" style="s2">community hub building essentially it</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">houses</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.320" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">about 30 different community</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">organizations it&#39;s a regional library</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">it has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">children&#39;s education area community</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">health area it has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">pottery studio a kiln an art gallery</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:14.640" style="s2">it&#39;s also a satellite</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">campus for a bachelor of applied science</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.640" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:19.520" style="s2">green architecture it&#39;s got real-time</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">readouts of your energy usage your water</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:24.320" style="s2">usage and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">i commissioned a study to see could we</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.320" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">get our</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">power from biogas and so there was a a</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:31.599" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">sort of shopping mall not far away that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:36.480" style="s2">had six tons</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">a week of you know green and food waste</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">that was just going straight to landfill</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">and so we commissioned a study to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">well how much energy could we get</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">from that you know what is now food</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">waste and we could</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">put a biodigester in the basement of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:52.240" style="s2">this building turn into biogas and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">power you know the buildings so we did a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.240" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">full-on feasibility study</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">uh and yeah it showed we could power at</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">least 240 kilowatts like permanently 24</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">7</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:06.560" style="s2">uh you know with biogas um</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">and it was you know we were on the verge</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.560" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">doing it but um you know unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">at that time</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">you know there was well the gas prices</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">were extremely</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">uh low uh compared to biogas and there</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">there was no incentive to switch to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">biogas there was no</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">regenerative economic incentive to say</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something good for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">environment and you&#39;re producing energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">and so the economics couldn&#39;t stack up</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">and for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">there was another realization that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">need to work at</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">a policy level you need to work at</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">systemic financial</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">system level uh you need to work with</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">um and that was kind of another lesson</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">that and i saw at melbourne water how</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">we&#39;d make it</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">work like public private partnership for</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">funding models</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:52.800" style="s2">where your first state quarter was the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">environment it kind of i thought okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.800" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">energy and green buildings is not quite</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">there yet but</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">it gave me ideas which fed into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">what would land</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">earth bank um fighting regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">economic incentive models</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.520" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">and kind of mainstreaming into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">financial system so</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:11.440" style="s2">before yeah that was a cool fun project</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">before we get to earth bank</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.440" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">i just really want to hit all this</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:17.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">unique like um you&#39;ve really like for</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.920" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">what you set out to do with earth bank</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">um your trajectory has given you</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">all the right background to really</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">understand down to the detail</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:31.680" style="s2">the kind of things that earth bank is</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">now exploring how to</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">finance those activities at scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">so so you really that done you a long</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">learning journey that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">and it seems like you&#39;re really bringing</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">all the elements together but before</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">before we go to earth bank</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">on one more chapter um which is your</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">work with alan savory</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">you know we need to get this knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">out there so she</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">really bargained hard with um i&#39;ll save</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">you and i mean we essentially gave all</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">of our time for free</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:41.359" style="s2">you know it&#39;s for the good of you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">we need to get this information all</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.359" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">together in one place it&#39;s 500</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">and something pages like long it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">massive</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">um so i wrote two chapters in the book</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">uh retired lyle</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">john liu uh you know lots of great</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">contributors</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">um and uh you know what it ended up</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.319" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">doing is now</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;s used it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s given freely</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">this as a textbook for the developing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">world to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">universities colleges everywhere so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">was kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:11.359" style="s2">alan and i sort of worked together on</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">that chapter and sort of brought it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.359" end="00:45:14.640" style="s2">together as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">that was part of the economic strain was</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.640" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">the economics of uh you know land</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">restoration</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">um particularly it was like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">get to a meta scale to sort of say well</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">how do you avoid civilizational collapse</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">you know how do you do that and what are</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">the first principles that you need</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">to look at and observe and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">and and where possible to adopt in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">really holistic context</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:41.680" style="s2">and so we you know we answer that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">question in a nutshell like</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">um do we have flowers</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">um where do you think would</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:53.359" style="s2">people should start that journey of of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.359" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">seriously thinking about how to reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">from the ground up yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">yes it&#39;s um you know the chapter was</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">called regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">agriculture to sustain civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">i think that encapsulates</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.160" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">quite a few of the truths that you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">unless</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.000" style="s2">we truly regenerate agriculture from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:19.599" style="s2">soil</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.000" end="00:46:22.720" style="s2">up um you know no amount of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.599" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">green energy no amount of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">um you know uh switch from fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">is going to save us from civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">um and uh i think the data proves that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">i mean we could we could even argue</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">whether we&#39;ve ever had</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">a civilization worthy its name that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">truly civil</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:48.319" style="s2">um with regard to the rest of life</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.319" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">um now there are some people who say</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">that the whole project of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:53.720" style="s2">a civilization which is often conceived</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">of as some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.720" end="00:46:59.839" style="s2">one-size-fits-all global or very large</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">entity um is maybe making concept</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.839" end="00:47:02.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">most of the previous civilizations that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.720" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">were referred to</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">were too big not to fail and maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the case for ours</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">but but i think when we use the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">civilization we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.800" end="00:47:18.240" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a diverse</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">network of regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.240" end="00:47:23.839" style="s2">carefully adapted to their bio regions</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:25.760" style="s2">that still hold the benefit of global</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.839" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">awareness and knowledge exchange</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.760" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">in a way that they are in solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">with each other so it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">nested scaling civilization that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">is uniquely expressed out of place in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">each</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">location um would you would you would</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">sign on the doc i would concur</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">my friend that that is uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">for sure the case i i sense that like</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really remarkable the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">the journey that you we&#39;ve just outlined</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">with everything that you&#39;ve already been</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">involved in but but</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:01.520" style="s2">i think the most remarkable step um is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">still to come which is that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.520" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">you you then realize that the highest</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">leverage point like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">in the degenerative system that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">driving the degeneration</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">at the fastest pace that it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">still happening right now is our</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:22.240" style="s2">dysfunctional economic system</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:22.720" style="s2">and the way that we handle finance work</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.240" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">banks and um and</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">how this insidious growth imperative</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">that is built</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">into an economic system that is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">blinded</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">to externalities because it only</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:41.839" style="s2">measures everything in</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">gdp um is really at the heart</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.839" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">of the problem and and so i believe</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:49.359" style="s2">that&#39;s when you started to work on</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:51.119" style="s2">on um all these new technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.359" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">this is where we&#39;re leaving my comfort</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.119" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">zone i&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:57.040" style="s2">um of a self-professed luddite and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">having difficulties with all that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.040" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">techy crypto stuff but um</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">you developed something called liquid</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">tokens and and really looked deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">how can we use these technologies for</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">and and then realize that really what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">needed is a new back</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">um so out of that developed what is now</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:21.040" style="s2">called earth bank so</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:21.040" style="s2">tell us how that journey started</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:25.440" style="s2">yeah yeah this is the transition to this</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">interesting journey that that kind of i</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">you know really started you know back in</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">my days at melbourne water where we</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">you know we developed this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">strategic plan for</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">a buyer region and a city-state and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">worked out a big budget of how do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">you know pay</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">uh land holders and farmers for</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">ecosystem services and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">always stuck in my memory that</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">you know well couldn&#39;t all governments</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">as wise as that um you know and develop</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">policies that um that have environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">as your first stakeholder if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.319" end="00:50:05.280" style="s2">providing drinking water</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">and i thought yeah having worked in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.280" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">different sort of government contexts</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:10.559" style="s2">around the world felt that this is going</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">to be very hard</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">to achieve you know this this level of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:19.599" style="s2">uh coordination and coherence i think i</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">got you know the more i got you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">with the green buildings and raising a</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">for sustainability initiatives and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:27.440" style="s2">renewable energy</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">i was based in southeast asia for three</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.440" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">years you know quite involved in</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">in renewable energy policy and renewable</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">energy projects and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">some very large scale and got involved</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">in renewable energy project finance</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">uh and you know at that time you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">um and i got involved in funds</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">management uh as well that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:49.839" style="s2">you know which was more of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">conventional fund uh but would strive</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.839" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">where possible to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">invest in in green real estate after</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">having the green real estate experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">thought okay this is a not only is it</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">really imperative for the planet that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">that we uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">transition to green real estate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">actually a business opportunity that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">people can</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.599" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">you know benefit if you can benefit the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">local community from having better</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:16.720" style="s2">facilities um better thermal comfort um</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">you know we could leverage capital into</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.720" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">that and that could be a good business</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">to be in</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">um so i sort of got involved in funds</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">management</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">uh you know green real estate</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:28.400" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">project finance and i got involved in</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.400" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">the public capital markets as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">in some some some ipos</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">on the australian securities exchange</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">some was an ag tech company</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">another was a fintech company and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:47.440" style="s2">over time i started um figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:50.319" style="s2">that you know the capital markets being</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.440" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">so hyper liquid</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.319" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">and uh having you know the volume of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">money that goes</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">through uh public equities markets is</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">just massive</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">and so i started looking at what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">doing on the fund management side</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">and looking at project finance and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:07.599" style="s2">looking at the public equities markets</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">and i was seeing all the ace</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.599" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">symmetries and where the gaps were where</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:13.920" style="s2">there&#39;s bottlenecks</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:15.040" style="s2">and then sort of mapping that onto my</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.920" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">history in</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.040" end="00:52:19.599" style="s2">regenerative and economic sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">environmental developments to say well</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.599" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">where could these map you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">coherently to provide some new</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">um to be able to facilitate the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">transition and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">flow of billions of dollars or even</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">trillions of dollars that the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">into the these very specific activities</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">of regeneration at scale</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">um and it led me to the conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">ultimately you need to retool the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">financial system you need to retool</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">capital and repurpose and provide</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">and so when i came across blockchain and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:55.119" style="s2">back to my computer science days i</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">thought well blockchain is very</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">you could program money</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:05.680" style="s2">to achieve certain policy outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">now if your policy is regeneration uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">at scale you know drawing down carbon</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">providing abundant healthy food</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">uh restoring fertility of soil what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">the principles</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">um that you can code into a currency to</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">then achieve those goals</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:22.160" style="s2">what are the incentives you could create</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:24.400" style="s2">to facilitate that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.160" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">um whether at policy level whether at</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.400" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">bank level</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">whether a local buyer regional uh mutual</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">uh credits and mutual economic transfer</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.319" end="00:53:38.280" style="s2">um you know like i&#39;ve experimented with</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">local currency in 2003 through</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.280" end="00:53:42.079" style="s2">2006 and seven on the big eco</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.400" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">neighborhood project if you were a local</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.079" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">contractor like you&#39;re a builder a</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">concrete and an electrician</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">you could essentially get you could</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">essentially use your local economic</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">um transfer currency let&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">as a down payment uh on a block and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:01.520" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">essentially use local currency to buy</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">the property that and you&#39;d been helping</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">out build it out</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">so from a local currency perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:09.599" style="s2">then blockchain comes along</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">like okay this is really interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.599" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">know programmable money</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.119" end="00:54:16.400" style="s2">uh that has a purpose and a goal whereas</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:19.319" style="s2">right now i think we would agree that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.400" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">we yeah that capital is like this</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.319" end="00:54:23.520" style="s2">self-replicating</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">thing that replicates without context to</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">local</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">context biodiversity people culture all</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">the things that we really value and hold</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">dear to our heart</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">capital is just a self-replicating thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">like the self-replicating um</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">you know paper clip experiment just keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:40.960" style="s2">replicating and growing</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">without context to you know the things</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.960" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">we hold dearest</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">and i think if we could provide that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:50.640" style="s2">to money and infuse you know decision</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.200" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">metrics to say well</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.640" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">why don&#39;t we make money smart and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">capital smart</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">true and having worked in that policy</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">arena of writing</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">helping write policy and programs that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">are scalable i thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">there needs to be a way to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:08.400" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.799" end="00:55:11.760" style="s2">base into code base um and try</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.400" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">to work backwards because knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.760" end="00:55:15.920" style="s2">governments you know the scale that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">need to move</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.920" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">and the scale and fast and speed that</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">governments move at</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">uh and also having worked at that local</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:26.640" style="s2">community level seeing how long it takes</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">to build that cultural</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.640" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">glue to work together and trust and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">build that up</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">it kind of felt to me well there</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">definitely needs to be a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.880" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">level initiative that is bringing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">knowledge base into a new code base and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:44.720" style="s2">a new architecture financial command</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:46.799" style="s2">for financial systems and so my approach</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.720" end="00:55:49.040" style="s2">to that was liquid token to say well</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.799" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">if we can tokenize an asset and make it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.040" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">liquid</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:55.760" style="s2">uh and have an own internal marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">which sets the price at a fair price</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.760" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">so it&#39;s not making it&#39;s not increasing</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:00.880" style="s2">volatility</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s increasing liquidity but without</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.880" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">increasing volatility</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.720" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">uh i.e it&#39;s not um rent-seeking or</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:10.240" style="s2">extractive on</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">the underlying which is uh land people</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.240" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">and so i started to think well if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">can do that</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">just so i&#39;m but i understand this</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:20.160" style="s2">correctly um liquidizing an asset means</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:22.559" style="s2">that if</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.160" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">if it&#39;s there&#39;s a value towards let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.559" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">say a building or</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">even a property um and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">you issue tokens that liquid tokens that</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">backed by that asset</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">therefore create liquidity</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:46.640" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:49.440" style="s2">how do you protect the asset against</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">like if something fails like would i</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">would would a</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:53.839" style="s2">token holder ever come back and and say</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.839" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">i want a piece of that asset or i own</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:56:58.480" style="s2">that asset because</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">most of the liquid tokens related to</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.480" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">that asset</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:03.760" style="s2">yeah so so it brings in a layer of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.760" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">uh that&#39;s important to say you know if</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:09.119" style="s2">this happens then what</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">you know what if then this happens and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.119" end="00:57:11.680" style="s2">then you sort of create a logic that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:14.079" style="s2">says well</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.680" end="00:57:14.799" style="s2">you know if if um you know for example a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.079" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">green building</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">is a good example investments in green</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">buildings you know generally you have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:24.240" style="s2">minimum</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.640" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">time horizon of at least 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">you know as an investor you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">invest in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s going to take a certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:32.799" style="s2">amount of time to recover the money</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:35.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve put into it</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.799" end="00:57:38.400" style="s2">okay to break even then</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.839" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">once you&#39;ve broken even you&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">hopefully i can now get paid for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">work i&#39;ve done um</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2">so then okay there&#39;s a period of getting</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">paid um</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:50.340" style="s2">your income and then you&#39;re sort of at a</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:51.520" style="s2">point where okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.340" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.520" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">now do i sell this asset and then move</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">on to the next one</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">and so um the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">you know if you want to encourage uh at</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:07.599" style="s2">investment into green buildings like</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">like i can say from experience like i</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.599" end="00:58:10.640" style="s2">know some of the biggest green building</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">funds in australia and they&#39;re not that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.640" end="00:58:13.599" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">you know and so i look at well what are</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.599" end="00:58:18.799" style="s2">some of the constraints</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">and why is that um and one of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.799" end="00:58:20.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:22.400" style="s2">is liquidity you know real estate is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.960" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">long-term</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.400" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">um industry but it&#39;s there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:30.720" style="s2">credit and liquidity from banks that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:31.680" style="s2">all geared towards totally unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.720" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.680" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">and if you want to do something</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">sustainable and something different</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:38.480" style="s2">the bank&#39;s like well i don&#39;t know if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">want to give you a loan for that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">know if</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">we want to give you mortgages to do a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">community garden on the roof</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">and the whole thing green and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.480" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">super insulated why can&#39;t you just do</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">what everyone else does</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">and so banks you know until very</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:54.079" style="s2">recently were very</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">um not supportive of green building</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.079" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">developments</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:58:58.240" style="s2">now they&#39;re all over it because you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">esg</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.240" end="00:59:01.520" style="s2">and reporting and they have to you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">so much more active activist</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.520" end="00:59:05.280" style="s2">shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">bringing scrutiny to their activities so</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.280" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:10.720" style="s2">you know back then it was like well how</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:14.400" style="s2">do you get more uh cash flowing in</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.720" end="00:59:16.880" style="s2">but you can increase the the total</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.400" end="00:59:19.119" style="s2">volume of money coming into this segment</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.880" end="00:59:20.000" style="s2">and so one thesis is that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.119" end="00:59:22.559" style="s2">ways you do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">is by creating funds that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.559" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">liquid</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:26.240" style="s2">where people can easily come in and out</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">of the fund</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.240" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">now traditionally when you&#39;re asked to</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:31.920" style="s2">come into a fund as an investor you</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">you say well okay once you come into</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.920" end="00:59:34.160" style="s2">this fund your money is locked up for 10</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.160" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">and you don&#39;t get your money back so for</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">quite a lot of people and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">regular folks that&#39;s a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:44.079" style="s2">disincentive to invest</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">in green buildings and so my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.079" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">was well if we could</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">reduce that disincentive and and make an</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:52.160" style="s2">incentive</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:53.280" style="s2">to invest in green building funds then</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.160" end="00:59:54.640" style="s2">more money is going to flow into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.280" end="00:59:56.400" style="s2">sector and therefore there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.640" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">more green building developments</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.400" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">um so so liquidity optionality</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">is a really good thing in that case now</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">one of the ways to protect</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:08.799" style="s2">the against volatility is where you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">an internal market so what we did with</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.799" end="01:00:11.200" style="s2">liquid token we built it essentially as</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:14.000" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.200" end="01:00:15.599" style="s2">fund management tool um you know for</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.000" end="01:00:18.240" style="s2">fund managers to use</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.599" end="01:00:18.880" style="s2">um so you could so basically what liquid</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:21.280" style="s2">token</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.880" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">software as a product can do is</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.280" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">essentially a fund manager can say yep i</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">want to use liquid token to run my fund</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:29.520" style="s2">and so liquid token gets set up it</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:31.839" style="s2">tokenizes a fund</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.520" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">or it just moves it onto the blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.839" end="01:00:33.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:36.960" style="s2">tokenized</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.920" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">uh amazon or blockchain is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:41.280" style="s2">basically to manage the cap table of</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">equity holders in a fund</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.280" end="01:00:45.839" style="s2">or unit holders in a fund and then what</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:48.480" style="s2">we do is we facilitate that those</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.839" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">uh shareholders can actually find each</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.480" end="01:00:51.280" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">in a peer-to-peer manner and actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.280" end="01:00:54.160" style="s2">sell and buy</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">between themselves so they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:00:57.440" style="s2">go back to the fund manager and say i</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">want my money back and the fund manager</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.440" end="01:01:00.960" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">sorry no can do whereas what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.960" end="01:01:04.880" style="s2">is empowering</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">the fund investors to find each other on</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.880" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">the platform</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">within the sort of liquid token</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:10.799" style="s2">environment and essentially</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:12.559" style="s2">buy and sell between each other and say</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.799" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">you know one investor might like i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.559" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">like to increase my holding in this</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">uh project one say i want to decrease my</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">holding the price is stable and is set</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:22.799" style="s2">by the fund manager</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.480" end="01:01:24.960" style="s2">so you&#39;re not increasing volatility but</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.799" end="01:01:26.480" style="s2">you are increasing liquidity</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.960" end="01:01:28.559" style="s2">so that people can come in and out</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:30.000" style="s2">without fear of</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">all your money being locked up for 10</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">years so we&#39;re trying to in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">democratize access</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:39.599" style="s2">infrastructure renewable energy because</p>

<p begin="01:01:39.599" end="01:01:43.359" style="s2">running that&#39;s offering this service and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.520" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">and you&#39;re still involved with it but</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:55.599" style="s2">in technology startups but a lot of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:58.079" style="s2">is tied</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.599" end="01:04:59.680" style="s2">to defense activity now in europe the</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.079" end="01:05:01.599" style="s2">european institute for innovation</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.680" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">and technology has got nothing to do</p>

<p begin="01:05:13.680" end="01:05:17.760" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.319" end="01:05:18.400" style="s2">um and so horizon 2020 was a big bucket</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.760" end="01:05:20.960" style="s2">of money</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.400" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">that has gone into startups like ours to</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.960" end="01:05:25.520" style="s2">develop uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:26.559" style="s2">the stream that coheres with european</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.520" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">policy</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.559" end="01:05:32.000" style="s2">um of you know being climate neutral</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:34.160" style="s2">carbon neutral by 2050 and so where</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.000" end="01:05:36.319" style="s2">earth bank fits into that</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.160" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">sort of meta strategic design is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.319" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">you know we i</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:40.720" style="s2">i personally and others on our team have</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:42.400" style="s2">a great history uh like</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.720" end="01:05:43.760" style="s2">now chief climate economist and others</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.400" end="01:05:44.720" style="s2">have a great history and our data</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.760" end="01:05:46.480" style="s2">scientists</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.720" end="01:05:48.240" style="s2">uh have a great history of developing</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.480" end="01:05:50.640" style="s2">decision metrics tools</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">to drive investment into ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.640" end="01:05:54.960" style="s2">restoration at scale</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:56.799" style="s2">uh and power new financial products like</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.960" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">micro insurance for farmers</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.799" end="01:06:00.559" style="s2">um and so we got some venture backing to</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:01.920" style="s2">do that because</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.559" end="01:06:04.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to roll out a green new</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.920" end="01:06:05.599" style="s2">deal you better invest in the right</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">things otherwise you could be throwing a</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.599" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">trillion euros down</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.680" end="01:06:12.720" style="s2">oops you know the proverbial so i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:16.319" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.720" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">a key consideration yeah and i mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:20.480" style="s2">because that that&#39;s one of the like in</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:23.440" style="s2">the discourse</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.480" end="01:06:24.720" style="s2">in social media and the public sphere at</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.440" end="01:06:26.720" style="s2">the moment there are a lot of voices</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.720" end="01:06:28.119" style="s2">that are very critical about the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.720" end="01:06:32.240" style="s2">green new deal</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.119" end="01:06:33.039" style="s2">technological right response to um both</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.240" end="01:06:35.359" style="s2">the pandemic and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.039" end="01:06:36.240" style="s2">and the climate crisis but i i often</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.359" end="01:06:37.839" style="s2">find that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.240" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">um it&#39;s a little bit disheartening</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.839" end="01:06:40.960" style="s2">because i really know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">that are in that area</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.960" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">doing good work with with who are</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:49.039" style="s2">very well intentioned and while</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">i i would say that of course all these</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.039" end="01:06:52.240" style="s2">technological and</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.559" end="01:06:54.000" style="s2">innovation and technology changes are</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.240" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">only part of the transformation that</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.000" end="01:06:57.839" style="s2">we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:06:59.200" style="s2">um in front of and have to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.839" end="01:07:02.160" style="s2">relatively quickly</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.200" end="01:07:04.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s still setting the conditions</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.160" end="01:07:05.119" style="s2">for real transformative societal change</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.480" end="01:07:07.760" style="s2">to happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.119" end="01:07:08.640" style="s2">if we invest in all these technologies</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.760" end="01:07:12.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.640" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">so in developing green green bank like</p>

<p begin="01:07:25.119" end="01:07:30.240" style="s2">um we have some uh so there&#39;s a presence</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.799" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">in sweden</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.240" end="01:07:34.079" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a presence in the uk and</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.920" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2">there&#39;s also a presence in usa</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.079" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">uh and so we need to take a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:41.359" style="s2">global approach to this</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:44.000" style="s2">to you know try and be truly systemic um</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.359" end="01:07:44.640" style="s2">and uh yeah so it&#39;s been great getting</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.000" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.640" end="01:07:48.559" style="s2">uh in europe and the nordics for what</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">earth bank is doing the nordics are</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.559" end="01:07:52.559" style="s2">quite strong on environmental analytics</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:54.720" style="s2">as well and fintech</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.559" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">uh so it&#39;s been good uh getting support</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.720" end="01:07:58.799" style="s2">there and uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:07:59.680" style="s2">we we think that europe is the right</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.799" end="01:08:03.440" style="s2">place to start</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.680" end="01:08:07.039" style="s2">because of the um the policy map</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.440" end="01:08:10.640" style="s2">um that is already</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.039" end="01:08:14.000" style="s2">laid out and agreed to and funded</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.640" end="01:08:15.920" style="s2">and so you know it makes sense to build</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.000" end="01:08:18.159" style="s2">the financial architecture to help that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.920" end="01:08:18.719" style="s2">transition of transitioning billions of</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.159" end="01:08:21.199" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.719" end="01:08:21.920" style="s2">into the right area with our decision</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.199" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">metrics</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.920" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">so we we were part of a central bank uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:30.400" style="s2">blockchain and fintech uh program uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.560" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">specifically for fintechs that had</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.400" end="01:08:35.040" style="s2">blockchain capabilities and technologies</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:36.400" style="s2">and were fintechs it just so happens we</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.040" end="01:08:38.159" style="s2">were the first climate</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.400" end="01:08:39.440" style="s2">of fintech to be accepted into that</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.159" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">program so</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.440" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">we we were kind of unique in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.319" end="01:08:45.359" style="s2">that getting to work with a central bank</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.759" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">is quite special it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.359" end="01:08:48.000" style="s2">unique</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">you don&#39;t really tend to get access like</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.000" end="01:08:52.880" style="s2">that um usually</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:55.199" style="s2">so we were lucky you know i think uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.880" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">there was only a very a handful of</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.199" end="01:08:59.920" style="s2">companies chosen to go into the program</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">and you know we were we were there so</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.920" end="01:09:05.839" style="s2">that sort of consisted of six months</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.319" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">this is european one called</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.839" end="01:09:09.759" style="s2">this is this is it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.839" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">national central bank that is supervised</p>

<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:15.679" style="s2">um and they&#39;re very strong on blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:17.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.679" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">they&#39;re also the biggest issuer of</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.440" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">digital banking licenses in europe</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:23.759" style="s2">uh so you know the biggest digital banks</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:26.080" style="s2">you think of like revolut</p>

<p begin="01:09:26.080" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">licensed by this</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.759" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">uh central bank uh google pay is less</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:33.199" style="s2">you know the big</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:34.880" style="s2">so they&#39;re you know they license the big</p>

<p begin="01:09:37.520" end="01:09:40.719" style="s2">systems out there</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.719" end="01:09:42.239" style="s2">um so that&#39;s good for us in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.719" end="01:09:44.239" style="s2">being able to access</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.239" end="01:09:45.440" style="s2">um a license that can cover all of</p>

<p begin="01:09:58.400" end="01:10:01.040" style="s2">good place</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:02.480" style="s2">uh where we&#39;ve put in the hard work and</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.040" end="01:10:05.040" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of battle tested</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.480" end="01:10:06.159" style="s2">you know we the central bank and</p>

<p begin="01:10:08.480" end="01:10:12.320" style="s2">could we</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.360" end="01:10:14.320" style="s2">actually issue accounts on this</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.320" end="01:10:16.960" style="s2">blockchain could we</p>

<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.560" end="01:10:28.480" style="s2">where we would test all the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">functionalities of you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.480" end="01:10:32.640" style="s2">uh issuing a green digital bond someone</p>

<p begin="01:10:57.920" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">kind of positions earth bank to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:03.360" style="s2">you know be a platform that can actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">issue green</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.360" end="01:11:08.640" style="s2">financial instruments that can help</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:09.679" style="s2">accelerate you know massive carbon</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.640" end="01:11:12.000" style="s2">drawdown</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.679" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">not just in the europe region but more</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.000" end="01:11:15.760" style="s2">broadly</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:18.080" style="s2">you know that achieving uh carbon</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.760" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">neutral by 2050 you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.080" end="01:11:21.199" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty difficult when your supply</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:22.640" style="s2">chains extend globally</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.199" end="01:11:24.239" style="s2">and so you really need to look at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.640" end="01:11:26.880" style="s2">global perspective</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.239" end="01:11:28.640" style="s2">um you know if you want to achieve that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.880" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">scale of change quickly</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.640" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">so yeah so we&#39;re well positioned if if</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">got a chance to to write the perfect</p>

<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:43.199" style="s2">um earth bank over the next 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.320" end="01:11:43.920" style="s2">um how would you see it develop and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.199" end="01:11:46.080" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.920" end="01:11:47.600" style="s2">what would you see as the main impacts</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.080" end="01:11:51.280" style="s2">and benefits</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.600" end="01:11:51.280" style="s2">from its success</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:56.560" style="s2">yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.719" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">the ideal future state that i would like</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.080" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:07.679" style="s2">uh be in is a future where</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:10.560" style="s2">you know earth bank has managed to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.679" end="01:12:13.679" style="s2">achieve a systemic</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.560" end="01:12:16.880" style="s2">level kind of of regenerative impact</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.679" end="01:12:20.640" style="s2">and by that i mean you know drawing down</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.880" end="01:12:23.840" style="s2">enough carbon to buy the planet</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.640" end="01:12:24.159" style="s2">you know time to decarbonize its economy</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.840" end="01:12:28.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.159" end="01:12:31.840" style="s2">go regenerative um you know it looks</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.400" end="01:12:35.199" style="s2">more like deep social equity</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.840" end="01:12:38.080" style="s2">at local level um</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.199" end="01:12:40.080" style="s2">where farmers are paid a fair price for</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.080" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">their what they&#39;re doing and incentivize</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.080" end="01:12:45.199" style="s2">to restore soils</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:47.360" style="s2">uh where renewable energy that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.199" end="01:12:49.520" style="s2">not kind of contaminated by dirty supply</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.360" end="01:12:53.920" style="s2">chains uh you know is truly</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.520" end="01:12:57.040" style="s2">more sustainable um and you have 24 7</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.920" end="01:13:00.320" style="s2">renewables not sort of standby</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.040" end="01:13:02.560" style="s2">coal and gas power there to</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.320" end="01:13:03.760" style="s2">you know in equal measure to renewable</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.560" end="01:13:04.800" style="s2">energy system because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.760" end="01:13:07.120" style="s2">sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.800" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">so you you know it would look like a</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.120" end="01:13:11.520" style="s2">very different world</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:13.440" style="s2">in 2030 and being the decade of</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.520" end="01:13:16.080" style="s2">ecosystem restoration</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.440" end="01:13:17.360" style="s2">this is the really big area for us is</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">protecting</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.360" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">those key critical biodiversity and</p>

<p begin="01:14:36.880" end="01:14:41.199" style="s2">and we have to regenerate what has been</p>

<p begin="01:14:41.199" end="01:14:48.239" style="s2">so to me it&#39;s a patchwork</p>

<p begin="01:14:59.440" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">but if you look at what agricultural</p>

<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:06.480" style="s2">soils have got you know you could draw</p>

<p begin="01:15:17.280" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">on this particular area of marginal</p>

<p begin="01:15:31.679" end="01:15:37.760" style="s2">and so one one of them did i always find</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.880" end="01:15:39.600" style="s2">really important as a piece of um like</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.760" end="01:15:41.920" style="s2">to to remind people of</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.600" end="01:15:44.080" style="s2">is that as we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.920" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">biosequestration and carbon drawdown</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.080" end="01:15:48.400" style="s2">um into into biomass and into our new</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:51.600" style="s2">material culture that is more</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.400" end="01:15:52.560" style="s2">biomaterials based um i mean you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.600" end="01:15:54.159" style="s2">lock</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.560" end="01:15:55.920" style="s2">through there&#39;s already a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:15:58.239" end="01:16:02.080" style="s2">structures inside so you can lock</p>

<p begin="01:16:02.080" end="01:16:06.560" style="s2">quite a long time</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.360" end="01:16:08.480" style="s2">200 300 years even but the carbon cycle</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.560" end="01:16:10.800" style="s2">in the biological carbon cycle is still</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.480" end="01:16:12.560" style="s2">a relatively short-lived cycle not</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.800" end="01:16:15.040" style="s2">necessarily from a human</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.560" end="01:16:16.080" style="s2">lifetime perspective um it&#39;s a few human</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.040" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">lifetimes but</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.080" end="01:16:23.920" style="s2">but from a life perspective um the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:25.360" style="s2">long range perspective it&#39;s only 300 250</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.920" end="01:16:28.400" style="s2">300 years something like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.360" end="01:16:30.880" style="s2">um so to not hit</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.400" end="01:16:31.760" style="s2">a ceiling in this i agree with you that</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.880" end="01:16:35.199" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.760" end="01:16:37.600" style="s2">possible and we have an opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.199" end="01:16:38.719" style="s2">to still come back to 250 parts per</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.600" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">million to actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.719" end="01:16:42.960" style="s2">get to a pre-industrial level of co2 in</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:46.640" style="s2">the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.960" end="01:16:49.120" style="s2">but um it needs also</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.640" end="01:16:49.679" style="s2">the transfer from biological sequestered</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.120" end="01:16:52.719" style="s2">carbon</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.679" end="01:16:53.520" style="s2">into geological sequestration and there</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.719" end="01:16:56.800" style="s2">are some</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.520" end="01:17:00.159" style="s2">bios mechanisms that can do that i mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.800" end="01:17:03.280" style="s2">coral reefs and um sea grass</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.159" end="01:17:05.760" style="s2">and um some</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.280" end="01:17:06.880" style="s2">fungal symbiotic relationships between</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.760" end="01:17:10.000" style="s2">certain trees</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.880" end="01:17:12.159" style="s2">can actually mineral mineralize um</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.000" end="01:17:13.679" style="s2">biological carbon and therefore take it</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.159" end="01:17:16.800" style="s2">into the geological</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.679" end="01:17:22.239" style="s2">cycle which is 10 000 years and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:24.560" style="s2">then we&#39;re in the game and we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.239" end="01:17:25.280" style="s2">absolutely this is a very important</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.560" end="01:17:28.400" style="s2">point you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.280" end="01:17:30.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve um crystallized that</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.400" end="01:17:32.640" style="s2">that we need to get it into the</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.880" end="01:17:35.840" style="s2">geological time scale</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.640" end="01:17:38.640" style="s2">uh and so humic carbon uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.840" end="01:17:39.520" style="s2">and and calciferous sort of calcium</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.640" end="01:17:42.400" style="s2">carbonates</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.520" end="01:17:42.960" style="s2">um so you know when you start to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.400" end="01:17:46.480" style="s2">into the</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.960" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">humic carbon formation and you start to</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.480" end="01:17:49.840" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:51.199" style="s2">um calcium carbonate formation</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">and you start to get into that</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.199" end="01:17:54.320" style="s2">geological time scale that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.960" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">need to get 100</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.320" end="01:17:59.520" style="s2">and mangroves are very very key</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:01.120" style="s2">to that if you can&#39;t protect your</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.520" end="01:18:03.920" style="s2">mangroves and if you don&#39;t restore</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.120" end="01:18:05.440" style="s2">mangroves and so we&#39;ve got this thing we</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.920" end="01:18:07.679" style="s2">call it the mangrove moon shot</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.440" end="01:18:10.640" style="s2">you know if you planted 20 billion</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.679" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">mangroves right which is totally doable</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.640" end="01:18:15.280" style="s2">based on assessment by the iucn which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:17.360" style="s2">also a partner in</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.280" end="01:18:18.560" style="s2">the conference the co conference each</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.360" end="01:18:22.000" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.560" end="01:18:24.880" style="s2">is that you know you can plan 20 billion</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.000" end="01:18:26.560" style="s2">now what happens is you start restoring</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.880" end="01:18:28.400" style="s2">the mangroves and i think you know this</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.560" end="01:18:29.600" style="s2">very well and this is for your viewers</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.400" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.600" end="01:18:33.840" style="s2">that you know as as the mangroves</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:35.120" style="s2">restore then they&#39;re starting to filter</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.840" end="01:18:37.679" style="s2">a lot of sediment</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.120" end="01:18:39.199" style="s2">and then those uh you know seagrasses</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.679" end="01:18:41.600" style="s2">are starting to recover</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.199" end="01:18:42.719" style="s2">and then the seagrasses together with</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.600" end="01:18:45.280" style="s2">the mangroves</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.719" end="01:18:46.400" style="s2">is just this carbon sequestration like</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.280" end="01:18:49.120" style="s2">swim power</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.400" end="01:18:50.320" style="s2">and the fish hatcheries that replenish</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.120" end="01:18:52.640" style="s2">the fisheries</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.320" end="01:18:54.400" style="s2">and the fisheries when they bounce back</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.640" end="01:18:56.640" style="s2">enable the whales to</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:18:58.239" style="s2">increase in in numbers and the whales</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.640" end="01:19:01.040" style="s2">have always been</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.239" end="01:19:01.679" style="s2">the nutrient pump in the ocean um</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.040" end="01:19:04.880" style="s2">bringing</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.679" end="01:19:07.360" style="s2">nutrients back from deep ocean</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.880" end="01:19:09.440" style="s2">foraging to the surface of the ocean to</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.360" end="01:19:10.080" style="s2">increase by productivity in the surface</p>

<p begin="01:19:10.080" end="01:19:14.560" style="s2">which is actually another carbon</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.600" end="01:19:17.920" style="s2">drawdown mechanism so you you create a</p>

<p begin="01:19:17.920" end="01:19:23.040" style="s2">feedback chain and and suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.040" end="01:19:24.400" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re regenerating those systems</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.040" end="01:19:25.280" style="s2">starting with mangroves and starting</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.400" end="01:19:28.000" style="s2">with seagrasses</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.280" end="01:19:29.040" style="s2">is definitely um also where i would put</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.000" end="01:19:32.080" style="s2">my bit</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.040" end="01:19:33.840" style="s2">before we we&#39;re almost out of uh time</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.080" end="01:19:35.760" style="s2">but but i wanted to ask you two more</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.840" end="01:19:37.360" style="s2">techie questions for my own benefit well</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.760" end="01:19:39.679" style="s2">because i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.360" end="01:19:40.800" style="s2">i i sort of mapped that area but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.679" end="01:19:43.040" style="s2">kind of mapped as</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.800" end="01:19:44.159" style="s2">terror incognito where i haven&#39;t done my</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.040" end="01:19:47.600" style="s2">my deep research</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.159" end="01:19:50.159" style="s2">um in and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.600" end="01:19:51.920" style="s2">where do you see like i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.159" end="01:19:53.280" style="s2">conversations with with gregory landor</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.920" end="01:19:55.199" style="s2">from the regen network</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.280" end="01:19:56.480" style="s2">and uh i know a few of the people</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.199" end="01:19:59.840" style="s2">involved in</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.480" end="01:20:01.920" style="s2">um holochain and um</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.840" end="01:20:03.440" style="s2">enlighten me from your perspective where</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.920" end="01:20:06.719" style="s2">those two pieces sit</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.440" end="01:20:09.520" style="s2">with earth bank and and would you</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.719" end="01:20:10.639" style="s2">see them as um doing something in</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.520" end="01:20:15.199" style="s2">parallel or</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.639" end="01:20:18.000" style="s2">is there a possible collaboration yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.199" end="01:20:19.040" style="s2">yeah definitely and you know had we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.000" end="01:20:21.920" style="s2">had many good</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.040" end="01:20:22.320" style="s2">chats with gregory uh and also christian</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.920" end="01:20:25.360" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.320" end="01:20:29.199" style="s2">and you know we we do have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.360" end="01:20:32.639" style="s2">a partnership uh with with uh regen</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.199" end="01:20:35.760" style="s2">network so the liquid token tokenization</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.639" end="01:20:35.760" style="s2">sort of software</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.840" end="01:20:39.360" style="s2">with with regen so you know we think</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.800" end="01:20:42.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.360" end="01:20:44.880" style="s2">what the ecological</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.400" end="01:20:47.280" style="s2">state verification protocols is going to</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.880" end="01:20:49.840" style="s2">be a cool collaboration with them</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.280" end="01:20:50.639" style="s2">uh and i guess what we&#39;re doing is kind</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.840" end="01:20:54.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.639" end="01:20:56.480" style="s2">the financial systems architecture</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.000" end="01:20:57.600" style="s2">um we do have some of our own kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.480" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">verification</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.600" end="01:21:04.719" style="s2">models but where our resolution</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:06.480" style="s2">and where we&#39;re at is is is a different</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.719" end="01:21:08.239" style="s2">area of verification to what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.480" end="01:21:09.760" style="s2">doing so you know we have to verify</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.239" end="01:21:12.000" style="s2">certain amount of things</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.760" end="01:21:13.120" style="s2">and what regen network are doing is like</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.000" end="01:21:16.639" style="s2">super</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.120" end="01:21:19.840" style="s2">detailed you know um you know like</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.639" end="01:21:21.840" style="s2">looking at um a wheat farm you know and</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.840" end="01:21:24.639" style="s2">no-till agriculture like very like</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.840" end="01:21:27.760" style="s2">they&#39;re honing in with such specific</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.639" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">specificity which is great um</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.760" end="01:21:32.000" style="s2">because we can draw on that knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:34.719" style="s2">base and it&#39;s an open source</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.000" end="01:21:37.040" style="s2">architecture which is cool and you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.719" end="01:21:39.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll be contributing to open source</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.040" end="01:21:40.400" style="s2">uh information architecture and also</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.840" end="01:21:42.719" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.400" end="01:21:44.800" style="s2">learning algorithms as well as we go to</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.719" end="01:21:47.360" style="s2">kind of be part of the open source</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.800" end="01:21:49.040" style="s2">movement as well so you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.360" end="01:21:50.639" style="s2">much a plug and play</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.040" end="01:21:52.880" style="s2">where we can collaborate with region</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.639" end="01:21:54.560" style="s2">network to draw upon the information</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.880" end="01:21:55.520" style="s2">base and data that they&#39;re gathering and</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.560" end="01:21:58.320" style="s2">developing</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.520" end="01:21:58.960" style="s2">and organizing um and we it can</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.320" end="01:22:02.239" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.960" end="01:22:02.880" style="s2">be part of helping inform our decision</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.239" end="01:22:06.320" style="s2">metrics</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.880" end="01:22:08.000" style="s2">and you know financial investment</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.320" end="01:22:08.719" style="s2">decisions that we package up into</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.000" end="01:22:11.199" style="s2">products</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.719" end="01:22:12.480" style="s2">for other banks or other financial</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.199" end="01:22:14.880" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.480" end="01:22:16.719" style="s2">so that&#39;s pretty cool holochain we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.880" end="01:22:18.960" style="s2">definitely you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.719" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">been admirers of what they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.960" end="01:22:25.040" style="s2">do and you know we um</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:28.159" style="s2">uh actually one of our uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.040" end="01:22:28.560" style="s2">key team members uh edward he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.159" end="01:22:30.800" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.560" end="01:22:32.719" style="s2">a little bit involved within that his</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.800" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">collaboration software</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.719" end="01:22:35.920" style="s2">uh actually got bought out by uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.800" end="01:22:38.159" style="s2">holochain</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.920" end="01:22:39.760" style="s2">so um so that so our director of</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.159" end="01:22:41.679" style="s2">strategy actually built</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.760" end="01:22:43.679" style="s2">uh a software product for collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.679" end="01:22:47.040" style="s2">that holochain is now using</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.679" end="01:22:49.440" style="s2">and you know working on to increase the</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.040" end="01:22:51.040" style="s2">sort of collaborative abilities um that</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.440" end="01:22:52.560" style="s2">the holochain can</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.040" end="01:22:54.639" style="s2">offer to the world which is cool so</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.560" end="01:22:57.520" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to plug in there as well</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.639" end="01:22:58.400" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s been a little bit of sort</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.520" end="01:23:01.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.400" end="01:23:01.679" style="s2">somewhat polemic against blockchain from</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.040" end="01:23:05.280" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.679" end="01:23:07.120" style="s2">um working in in holochain and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.280" end="01:23:08.000" style="s2">quite understanding the details about it</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.120" end="01:23:11.040" style="s2">like somehow</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.000" end="01:23:14.480" style="s2">i i was reminded of the early battles</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.040" end="01:23:17.199" style="s2">when electricity was um starting to</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.480" end="01:23:20.000" style="s2">roll out between are we going to for the</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.199" end="01:23:22.960" style="s2">ac system or the dc system and and we</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.000" end="01:23:23.280" style="s2">unfortunately went for the um ac system</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.960" end="01:23:24.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.280" end="01:23:26.800" style="s2">and wasted a lot of energy in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.800" end="01:23:29.679" style="s2">process and if we had listened to</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.800" end="01:23:30.960" style="s2">tesla rather than edison um the the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.679" end="01:23:33.120" style="s2">world would have taken quite a</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.960" end="01:23:34.400" style="s2">different turn and is it really</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.120" end="01:23:36.719" style="s2">analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.400" end="01:23:37.520" style="s2">to the conversation building all these</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.719" end="01:23:40.880" style="s2">platforms</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.520" end="01:23:43.520" style="s2">on the blockchain or or working with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.880" end="01:23:44.960" style="s2">the more distributed sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.520" end="01:23:47.679" style="s2">biometrically informed</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.960" end="01:23:49.360" style="s2">holochain approach uh do you do you see</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.679" end="01:23:52.320" style="s2">it quite as</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.360" end="01:23:53.440" style="s2">fundamental as a baseline decisions</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.320" end="01:23:56.960" style="s2">really high upstream</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.440" end="01:23:59.679" style="s2">or can the two actually some</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.960" end="01:24:01.600" style="s2">form a symbiosis where you where you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.679" end="01:24:04.080" style="s2">use holochain technology in the context</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.600" end="01:24:06.239" style="s2">of blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.080" end="01:24:07.440" style="s2">yeah and i i think you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.239" end="01:24:10.239" style="s2">good question and</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.440" end="01:24:10.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a pretty complex landscape</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.239" end="01:24:13.520" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.800" end="01:24:14.960" style="s2">constantly evolving you know month by</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.520" end="01:24:17.360" style="s2">month something is changing and</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.960" end="01:24:21.120" style="s2">something new is emerging in this</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.360" end="01:24:23.520" style="s2">very dynamic area so i i can&#39;t speak in</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.120" end="01:24:26.080" style="s2">absolutes but i can say that</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.520" end="01:24:27.440" style="s2">from a sort of evolutionary emergent</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.080" end="01:24:30.719" style="s2">property perspective that</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.440" end="01:24:33.040" style="s2">that what blockchain is representing</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.719" end="01:24:34.880" style="s2">from a decentralization perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.040" end="01:24:36.639" style="s2">what holochain is representing in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.880" end="01:24:39.360" style="s2">sort of distributed ledger</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.639" end="01:24:40.639" style="s2">so it&#39;s a distributed ledger technology</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.360" end="01:24:42.639" style="s2">and not a blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.639" end="01:24:44.239" style="s2">but blockchain is a distributed ledger</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.639" end="01:24:47.120" style="s2">technology so</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.239" end="01:24:48.960" style="s2">um so you could say that broadly we have</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.120" end="01:24:51.760" style="s2">distributed ledger technologies</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.960" end="01:24:52.239" style="s2">and one of which a subset is blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.760" end="01:24:55.199" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.239" end="01:24:56.000" style="s2">blockchain can you know do all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.199" end="01:24:58.400" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.000" end="01:24:59.360" style="s2">are automating functions that are now</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:00.960" style="s2">manual so</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.360" end="01:25:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a pretty cool thing that</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.960" end="01:25:04.560" style="s2">you know if we want to like scale up</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.120" end="01:25:05.199" style="s2">regenerative agriculture and program</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.560" end="01:25:06.960" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.199" end="01:25:08.960" style="s2">to achieve regenerative outcomes you</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.960" end="01:25:09.600" style="s2">know blockchain can be very handy for</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.960" end="01:25:11.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.600" end="01:25:12.800" style="s2">uh it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only tool</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.199" end="01:25:14.639" style="s2">because in the tool set you have</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.800" end="01:25:17.679" style="s2">distributed ledger technologies</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.639" end="01:25:18.320" style="s2">with which holochain is one um so you</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.679" end="01:25:21.840" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.320" end="01:25:24.080" style="s2">they&#39;re all tools um in the toolbox</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.840" end="01:25:25.040" style="s2">that we can choose from to achieve the</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.080" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.040" end="01:25:29.520" style="s2">um and i try not to you know blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.840" end="01:25:31.199" style="s2">is one of many tools you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.520" end="01:25:33.920" style="s2">really big fans of open banking</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.199" end="01:25:36.000" style="s2">technology now open banking technology</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.920" end="01:25:37.199" style="s2">is not powered by blockchain but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.000" end="01:25:39.920" style="s2">it&#39;s committed to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.199" end="01:25:41.920" style="s2">principles of transparency uh and</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.920" end="01:25:45.120" style="s2">interoperability</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.920" end="01:25:46.960" style="s2">um now so you know so we</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.120" end="01:25:48.159" style="s2">so a lot of what the work we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.960" end="01:25:51.199" style="s2">right now is is</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.159" end="01:25:52.639" style="s2">is actually not uh involving so much on</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.199" end="01:25:54.480" style="s2">blockchain because</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.639" end="01:25:55.920" style="s2">right now there&#39;s a lot of technology</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.480" end="01:25:56.800" style="s2">constraints and bottlenecks with</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.920" end="01:25:59.280" style="s2">blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.800" end="01:26:00.239" style="s2">that has meant that it hasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.280" end="01:26:02.320" style="s2">scaled</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.239" end="01:26:04.239" style="s2">to the sort of internet of money that</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.320" end="01:26:06.239" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s proposing to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.239" end="01:26:07.520" style="s2">and so from our perspective there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.239" end="01:26:10.560" style="s2">whole bunch of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.520" end="01:26:12.400" style="s2">system conditions and sort of um</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.560" end="01:26:14.239" style="s2">i guess path dependencies that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.400" end="01:26:15.760" style="s2">yet been addressed in our</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.239" end="01:26:17.600" style="s2">you know perspective from the first</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.760" end="01:26:19.760" style="s2">principles uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.600" end="01:26:22.480" style="s2">you know where blockchain is at is right</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.760" end="01:26:25.040" style="s2">now is it&#39;s it&#39;s still very early days</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.480" end="01:26:26.239" style="s2">it&#39;s got huge potential obviously uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.040" end="01:26:29.520" style="s2">enterprise blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.239" end="01:26:32.560" style="s2">has had a lot of uptake recently in</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.520" end="01:26:36.239" style="s2">banks um in everything from</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.560" end="01:26:38.560" style="s2">supply chains uh and so in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.239" end="01:26:40.639" style="s2">blockchain is kind of a little bit like</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.560" end="01:26:42.719" style="s2">what open source software</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.639" end="01:26:44.480" style="s2">was like people said ah open source</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.719" end="01:26:46.719" style="s2">software it&#39;s not really a thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.480" end="01:26:50.000" style="s2">like how can you do that but yet right</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.719" end="01:26:51.760" style="s2">now open source software is self-evident</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.000" end="01:26:53.600" style="s2">it became not just a movement it</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.760" end="01:26:55.280" style="s2">literally powered a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.600" end="01:26:57.520" style="s2">the big technology companies you see</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.280" end="01:27:00.239" style="s2">today and just like right now</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.520" end="01:27:00.719" style="s2">machine learning algorithms the best are</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.239" end="01:27:03.600" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.719" end="01:27:04.000" style="s2">open source you know that are used you</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.600" end="01:27:07.199" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.000" end="01:27:08.080" style="s2">conventionally um in industry um and</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.199" end="01:27:11.440" style="s2">academia</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.080" end="01:27:12.480" style="s2">particularly so so we can say that</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.440" end="01:27:14.239" style="s2">blockchain is a bit like</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.480" end="01:27:15.679" style="s2">open source software right now that in</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.239" end="01:27:16.480" style="s2">the beginning people saying oh this</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.679" end="01:27:17.679" style="s2">thing you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.480" end="01:27:19.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit too hard it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.679" end="01:27:21.520" style="s2">going to work you know it doesn&#39;t but i</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.600" end="01:27:22.320" style="s2">think what&#39;s going to evolve over time</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.520" end="01:27:25.040" style="s2">is open</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.320" end="01:27:26.080" style="s2">architecture that&#39;s interoperable um and</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.040" end="01:27:30.239" style="s2">these are all part</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.080" end="01:27:30.239" style="s2">of that you know um</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.719" end="01:27:34.719" style="s2">one final question really um i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.280" end="01:27:36.239" style="s2">could go on forever because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.719" end="01:27:36.639" style="s2">much interesting things to learn from</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.239" end="01:27:42.320" style="s2">you and</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.639" end="01:27:44.840" style="s2">with you there&#39;s underlying this whole</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.320" end="01:27:46.000" style="s2">really positive intent that is basically</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.840" end="01:27:48.000" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.000" end="01:27:49.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if the</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.000" end="01:27:50.480" style="s2">guardians of the land whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.760" end="01:27:52.880" style="s2">farmers</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.480" end="01:27:54.159" style="s2">um peasant farmers anywhere in the world</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.880" end="01:27:57.360" style="s2">or indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.159" end="01:28:00.639" style="s2">people still maintaining um</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.360" end="01:28:02.560" style="s2">the ecosystems that they</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.639" end="01:28:04.239" style="s2">deeply believe they belong to rather</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.560" end="01:28:05.280" style="s2">than the ecosystems belonging to them</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.239" end="01:28:07.360" style="s2">which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.280" end="01:28:09.520" style="s2">real shift that i think we need to make</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.360" end="01:28:13.520" style="s2">and come back to understand yes</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.520" end="01:28:13.520" style="s2">we belong to the land um</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.679" end="01:28:17.920" style="s2">i know that there&#39;s lots of people in</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.280" end="01:28:21.199" style="s2">this field who are really trying hard</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.920" end="01:28:22.239" style="s2">to funnel investment and funds to</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.199" end="01:28:25.800" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.239" end="01:28:28.480" style="s2">the people who are caring for improving</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.800" end="01:28:29.760" style="s2">bioproductivity and healthy ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.480" end="01:28:34.080" style="s2">restoration and</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.760" end="01:28:35.520" style="s2">ecosystems functions but and</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.080" end="01:28:38.719" style="s2">for me there&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.520" end="01:28:42.639" style="s2">question where when i look at</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.719" end="01:28:45.520" style="s2">the sort of proof of change</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.639" end="01:28:46.080" style="s2">of state or change of state protocols</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.520" end="01:28:48.480" style="s2">regen</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.080" end="01:28:49.679" style="s2">and and all all these attempts of</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.480" end="01:28:51.760" style="s2">bringing in</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.679" end="01:28:52.960" style="s2">high technology whether it&#39;s through</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.760" end="01:28:56.480" style="s2">local sensors</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.960" end="01:28:59.520" style="s2">or using digital remote imagery and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.480" end="01:29:00.159" style="s2">um working algorithms that that use that</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.520" end="01:29:01.760" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.159" end="01:29:04.639" style="s2">to to prove what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.760" end="01:29:07.199" style="s2">ground are we not in danger of</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.639" end="01:29:08.639" style="s2">now connecting this vast amount of</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.199" end="01:29:11.600" style="s2">peasant farmers who are still</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.639" end="01:29:13.360" style="s2">caring for land around the world and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.600" end="01:29:16.480" style="s2">the indigenous people</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.360" end="01:29:20.880" style="s2">to a technology</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.480" end="01:29:22.480" style="s2">that the only way to access the money</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.880" end="01:29:24.480" style="s2">is through the technology and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.480" end="01:29:25.360" style="s2">technology is going to change them as</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.480" end="01:29:28.080" style="s2">soon as they</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.360" end="01:29:29.040" style="s2">are forced to use it and similarly if</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.080" end="01:29:32.239" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.040" end="01:29:32.960" style="s2">gift cultures that have been evolving</p>

<p begin="01:29:32.960" end="01:29:38.560" style="s2">very very long time frame the</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.080" end="01:29:41.040" style="s2">the kind of colonialization of the mind</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.560" end="01:29:43.440" style="s2">that comes in with the use of technology</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.040" end="01:29:44.800" style="s2">and maybe also would come in with the</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.440" end="01:29:48.159" style="s2">influx of</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.800" end="01:29:50.639" style="s2">suddenly a lot more money that then</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.159" end="01:29:51.280" style="s2">than their self-sufficiency systems have</p>

<p begin="01:29:51.280" end="01:29:59.679" style="s2">for millennia um isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.400" end="01:29:59.679" style="s2">a slight danger that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.920" end="01:30:03.440" style="s2">in the best of intentions to serve could</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.040" end="01:30:06.400" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.440" end="01:30:07.520" style="s2">negative side effects or in an even more</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.400" end="01:30:09.199" style="s2">extreme way</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.520" end="01:30:10.560" style="s2">that by building the technology that</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.199" end="01:30:13.760" style="s2">would allow</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.560" end="01:30:16.880" style="s2">um social and ecological capital to</p>

<p begin="01:30:32.080" end="01:30:35.520" style="s2">of the the remaining comments um where</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.120" end="01:30:37.199" style="s2">do you</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.520" end="01:30:38.719" style="s2">like it for me that&#39;s a really sticky</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.199" end="01:30:42.080" style="s2">point and</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.719" end="01:30:44.719" style="s2">what do you sit with that yeah it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.080" end="01:30:45.760" style="s2">the the the risks you talk of are very</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.719" end="01:30:49.040" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.760" end="01:30:51.440" style="s2">and and i take them very</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.040" end="01:30:52.639" style="s2">seriously that that we need to address</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.440" end="01:30:55.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.639" end="01:30:56.880" style="s2">you know for one thing i i think all</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.280" end="01:31:00.080" style="s2">technology companies</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.880" end="01:31:01.280" style="s2">all technology companies</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.080" end="01:31:03.280" style="s2">and particularly ones that are going to</p>

<p begin="01:31:37.840" end="01:31:41.840" style="s2">so in sync with their environment and</p>

<p begin="01:31:48.639" end="01:31:51.920" style="s2">absolutely take them away from that and</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.280" end="01:31:54.239" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.920" end="01:31:55.600" style="s2">like when we&#39;re in costa rica last year</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.239" end="01:31:58.880" style="s2">and met</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.600" end="01:32:01.600" style="s2">um an elder you know who</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.880" end="01:32:02.400" style="s2">he had he they brought some cacao that</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.600" end="01:32:04.880" style="s2">they&#39;d grown in</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.400" end="01:32:06.560" style="s2">jungle rainforest and said you know we</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.880" end="01:32:08.880" style="s2">need your help</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.560" end="01:32:10.800" style="s2">um because and this was in an area of</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.880" end="01:32:13.440" style="s2">costa rica where 1.5</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.800" end="01:32:13.920" style="s2">of the entire world&#39;s biodiversity is in</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.440" end="01:32:16.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.920" end="01:32:17.520" style="s2">like particular area of costa rica it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.159" end="01:32:20.880" style="s2">mind-blowing</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.520" end="01:32:22.560" style="s2">you know and so these people they embody</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.880" end="01:32:24.480" style="s2">all of that knowledge and more</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.560" end="01:32:26.400" style="s2">and so he was saying this was saying you</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.480" end="01:32:28.400" style="s2">know the kids are getting onto the</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.400" end="01:32:30.639" style="s2">mobile phones and they&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.400" end="01:32:31.600" style="s2">they&#39;re it&#39;s like sucking their</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.639" end="01:32:34.960" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.600" end="01:32:36.639" style="s2">like and from his perspective you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.960" end="01:32:39.120" style="s2">and world view it&#39;s like sucking a</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.639" end="01:32:40.960" style="s2">spirit right and so that is kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.120" end="01:32:42.880" style="s2">thing that</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.960" end="01:32:44.719" style="s2">you know and a lot of people in silicon</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.880" end="01:32:47.120" style="s2">valley have observed but</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.719" end="01:32:48.000" style="s2">our relationship with technology is not</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.120" end="01:32:50.880" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.000" end="01:32:53.120" style="s2">you know they&#39;ve created a monster and</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.880" end="01:32:55.679" style="s2">so we need to address that monster</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.120" end="01:32:57.360" style="s2">for me it&#39;s partially i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.679" end="01:32:59.199" style="s2">about this a lot lately and because</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.360" end="01:33:00.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of you know i did</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.199" end="01:33:03.600" style="s2">these um</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.880" end="01:33:04.000" style="s2">sdg community implementation flashcards</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.600" end="01:33:06.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.000" end="01:33:08.320" style="s2">my work with guy education and one of</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.480" end="01:33:10.320" style="s2">the the sort of design</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.320" end="01:33:12.239" style="s2">briefs that i set myself working with</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.320" end="01:33:13.440" style="s2">them is like i wanted to create a tool</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.239" end="01:33:15.199" style="s2">the use of which which</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.440" end="01:33:16.800" style="s2">would change the way people think like</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.199" end="01:33:17.199" style="s2">following bucky fuller&#39;s advice that</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.800" end="01:33:19.040" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.199" end="01:33:21.199" style="s2">don&#39;t tell people what to think if you</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.040" end="01:33:23.280" style="s2">want to check them to change their mind</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.199" end="01:33:24.400" style="s2">give them a tool the use of which will</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.280" end="01:33:27.440" style="s2">change the way they think</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.400" end="01:33:27.920" style="s2">and then suddenly um maybe about a year</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.440" end="01:33:31.360" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.920" end="01:33:33.120" style="s2">it occurred to me that if you really sit</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.360" end="01:33:34.159" style="s2">with that sentence and you really pay</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.120" end="01:33:35.840" style="s2">attention to it then</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.159" end="01:33:37.360" style="s2">all our technologies starting with the</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.840" end="01:33:38.960" style="s2">printing press and certainly with the</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.360" end="01:33:39.840" style="s2">computers we&#39;re using to talk to each</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.960" end="01:33:41.920" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.840" end="01:33:43.120" style="s2">are changing the way we think sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.920" end="01:33:45.679" style="s2">for the better sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.120" end="01:33:46.320" style="s2">for the worst but we really need to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.679" end="01:33:48.719" style="s2">careful</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.320" end="01:33:49.760" style="s2">of that power of technology to</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.719" end="01:33:53.920" style="s2">colonialize</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.760" end="01:33:56.800" style="s2">us and and change us and and the the</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.920" end="01:33:57.199" style="s2">stirring into that skid um taking a</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.800" end="01:33:59.360" style="s2">piece</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.199" end="01:34:01.840" style="s2">of advice from from the the poet</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.360" end="01:34:05.040" style="s2">scientist</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.840" end="01:34:05.679" style="s2">who sees who everywhere doesn&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="01:34:05.679" end="01:34:10.480" style="s2">anywhere in the right light i actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.000" end="01:34:12.719" style="s2">think we need to reframe</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.480" end="01:34:14.320" style="s2">technology and understand that there are</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.719" end="01:34:16.400" style="s2">technologies of the sacred that the</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.320" end="01:34:18.960" style="s2">aboriginal elders you were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.400" end="01:34:20.000" style="s2">beginning of this conversation have been</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.960" end="01:34:21.840" style="s2">guarding for 10</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.000" end="01:34:23.920" style="s2">000 years and these technologies are</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.840" end="01:34:25.600" style="s2">more powerful than anything that has</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.920" end="01:34:29.920" style="s2">come out of silicon valley</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.600" end="01:34:32.719" style="s2">and similarly if everything is nature</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.920" end="01:34:34.880" style="s2">we have to include all our crude</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.719" end="01:34:37.920" style="s2">mechanistic technology</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.880" end="01:34:38.639" style="s2">into that larger container but then also</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.920" end="01:34:42.960" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.639" end="01:34:46.000" style="s2">that and if your father like just</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.960" end="01:34:48.639" style="s2">being with the magic of two</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.000" end="01:34:49.920" style="s2">cells meeting and then over nine months</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.639" end="01:34:52.719" style="s2">inside a womb</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.920" end="01:34:54.400" style="s2">turning into this creature that that</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.719" end="01:34:56.320" style="s2">that suddenly sees the light of</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.400" end="01:34:58.719" style="s2">this this world and then watching this</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.320" end="01:35:01.280" style="s2">creature transform over the last</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.719" end="01:35:02.239" style="s2">tomorrow&#39;s my daughter&#39;s third birthday</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.280" end="01:35:04.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.239" end="01:35:06.719" style="s2">you you just look at technology and you</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.159" end="01:35:07.119" style="s2">say like we&#39;re so arrogant to believe</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.719" end="01:35:10.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.119" end="01:35:10.719" style="s2">that that what we call high technology</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.080" end="01:35:12.960" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.719" end="01:35:14.480" style="s2">even the slightest to hold again against</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.960" end="01:35:18.719" style="s2">the real true technology</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.480" end="01:35:20.159" style="s2">of of of um the wider system that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.719" end="01:35:21.840" style="s2">part of of life</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.159" end="01:35:24.480" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s about reframing</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.840" end="01:35:26.560" style="s2">technology in that larger context and</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.480" end="01:35:28.080" style="s2">and and being humble about what</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.560" end="01:35:30.320" style="s2">technology actually can achieve</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.080" end="01:35:32.000" style="s2">and what it&#39;s for and then really having</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.320" end="01:35:34.320" style="s2">ethical conversations around</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.000" end="01:35:35.520" style="s2">what technologies to use when when and</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.320" end="01:35:39.920" style="s2">which ones not to use</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.520" end="01:35:42.719" style="s2">and that that will be part of our</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.920" end="01:35:44.480" style="s2">um right of passage as a species to</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.719" end="01:35:48.320" style="s2">whether we&#39;re actually going to make it</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.480" end="01:35:51.360" style="s2">um through this i have the needle oh</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.320" end="01:35:53.840" style="s2">i 100 agree that&#39;s the it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.360" end="01:35:56.320" style="s2">technology and our relationship with it</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.840" end="01:35:57.600" style="s2">and our ability and our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.320" end="01:36:01.280" style="s2">wisely</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.600" end="01:36:05.199" style="s2">uh wield such tools uh in the right way</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.280" end="01:36:07.600" style="s2">is is i agree is going to decide whether</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.199" end="01:36:08.639" style="s2">the fate of the human species becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.600" end="01:36:12.159" style="s2">footnote</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.639" end="01:36:14.639" style="s2">in sort of gaia&#39;s uh experiments or</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.159" end="01:36:16.639" style="s2">if we you know we tried they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.639" end="01:36:18.800" style="s2">quite work out as humans but</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.639" end="01:36:20.080" style="s2">or maybe we could work out and maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.800" end="01:36:23.119" style="s2">could flourish</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.080" end="01:36:24.880" style="s2">into uh wonderful uh beings that were</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.119" end="01:36:27.199" style="s2">obviously meant to be so</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.880" end="01:36:29.840" style="s2">i really hope that we can get there and</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.199" end="01:36:31.440" style="s2">um like you said you need to refrain</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.840" end="01:36:33.119" style="s2">i&#39;m deeply grateful that you are out</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.440" end="01:36:35.119" style="s2">there doing the work you do and that</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.119" end="01:36:38.000" style="s2">makes me hopeful that we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.119" end="01:36:38.639" style="s2">um take that second path here just spoke</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.000" end="01:36:40.719" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.639" end="01:36:42.000" style="s2">that we we still have a role to play we</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.719" end="01:36:44.880" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.000" end="01:36:48.000" style="s2">um intelligent heartfelt compassionate</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.880" end="01:36:51.119" style="s2">loving keystone species that celebrate</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.000" end="01:36:54.239" style="s2">life in the way that we</p>
