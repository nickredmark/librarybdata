<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:48.120" style="s2">stuck interest in the phenomenon quickly</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.390" end="00:00:51.720" style="s2">spread far and wide with many thousands</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.120" end="00:00:55.950" style="s2">joining the conversation online welcomed</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.720" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">by some ridiculed by others and even</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">like a herd of cats right because so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.420" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">thought about well what what what unites</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">us to the degree that there&#39;s an us</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:12.540" style="s2">because that&#39;s not so self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:16.350" style="s2">there&#39;s enough of an us so that the name</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.540" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">emerged and it&#39;s stuck so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.350" end="00:01:20.760" style="s2">something in common because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:23.490" style="s2">the name wouldn&#39;t have stuck right you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.760" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">can&#39;t name nothing it doesn&#39;t work so</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">in the group tend to reject orthodoxy</p>

<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">interested in first principles thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:43.580" style="s2">meaning that if you you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:46.049" style="s2">something on faith it&#39;s a very smart</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.580" end="00:01:49.189" style="s2">concept to try to corral a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.049" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">difficult group of very disparate people</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.189" end="00:01:55.890" style="s2">into one orbit I think everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">being described as a member that I the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.890" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">IDW probably has among other things one</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">thing in common which is they all are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">used to being held at for saying things</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:09.269" style="s2">that are self-evident how old that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">public only to then discover that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.269" end="00:02:12.660" style="s2">public come up to them in private and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">say thank you so much for saying what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:16.650" style="s2">think I would say it is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">manifestation of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.650" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">process of thinking that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:22.739" style="s2">important than the conclusions that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:24.269" style="s2">generated you need a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.739" end="00:02:26.299" style="s2">are willing to say hey you know you made</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.269" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">a better point I changed my mind and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.299" end="00:02:32.549" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned something that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:35.159" style="s2">think about and that kind of integrity</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.549" end="00:02:38.489" style="s2">in a conversation is what characterizes</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.159" end="00:02:40.530" style="s2">a lot of the internal IDW discussion to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.489" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">me it&#39;s that people agree not on their</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.530" end="00:02:44.220" style="s2">positions they may not even agree as to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">what the facts are but they usually</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.220" end="00:02:48.540" style="s2">agree as to what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:50.609" style="s2">conversation the intellectual darkweb</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.540" end="00:02:53.000" style="s2">seemed like something Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.609" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">came up with on the spur of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.000" end="00:03:00.989" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t it had been years in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">making part of me wants to work quietly</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.989" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">and part of me realizes that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:10.349" style="s2">work in some public facing capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:14.489" style="s2">I personally have found it much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.349" end="00:03:17.750" style="s2">comfortable to have a private life to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.489" end="00:03:20.639" style="s2">not have everything that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.750" end="00:03:23.579" style="s2">broadcast to a large audience but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.639" end="00:03:24.989" style="s2">think we&#39;ve run out of time and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.579" end="00:03:29.099" style="s2">think some of us are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.989" end="00:03:31.379" style="s2">reluctantly choosing to make a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.099" end="00:03:33.079" style="s2">call now I think that with the current</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.379" end="00:03:37.199" style="s2">administration and the White House</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.079" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing a real discontinuity with</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.199" end="00:03:41.609" style="s2">the past and it wasn&#39;t the discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:43.560" style="s2">that I was hoping for we had to break</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.609" end="00:03:45.000" style="s2">with the past and I think that the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">in which we are now breaking with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.000" end="00:03:49.500" style="s2">past is so destructive nobody knows what</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:53.549" style="s2">to believe nobody quite knows what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.500" end="00:03:55.739" style="s2">true nobody knows where to turn this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.549" end="00:03:57.569" style="s2">not a tenable situation and so either</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.739" end="00:04:00.810" style="s2">we&#39;re going to descend into some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.569" end="00:04:02.879" style="s2">permanent chaos or there is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.810" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">have to be something that we reboot from</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:07.470" style="s2">and that thing cannot be simply left or</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:11.159" style="s2">simply right and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.470" end="00:04:14.350" style="s2">reasons the IDW is hopeful to me this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.159" end="00:04:16.630" style="s2">the origin story of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.350" end="00:04:20.030" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.630" end="00:04:23.000" style="s2">what started off this path that I find</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.030" end="00:04:25.460" style="s2">myself on is that I was curious about</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.000" end="00:04:27.350" style="s2">certain things curious about the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.460" end="00:04:31.250" style="s2">and I wanted to ask a bunch of questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.350" end="00:04:32.990" style="s2">about well really pretty much everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.250" end="00:04:36.590" style="s2">and I find that if you keep asking why</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.990" end="00:04:38.480" style="s2">questions you eventually either a get</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.590" end="00:04:42.710" style="s2">tired or B become a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.480" end="00:04:45.560" style="s2">physicist or mathematician and so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.710" end="00:04:47.390" style="s2">of the deepest questions led to a kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.560" end="00:04:52.070" style="s2">of disciplined way of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.390" end="00:04:54.790" style="s2">world where we see all of the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.070" end="00:04:58.220" style="s2">in the world around us as being built up</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.790" end="00:05:01.970" style="s2">from very simple and beautiful patterns</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.220" end="00:05:05.630" style="s2">and I think was my desire to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.970" end="00:05:09.020" style="s2">to that story in particular with</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.630" end="00:05:12.710" style="s2">theoretical physics that began my path</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.020" end="00:05:15.560" style="s2">but at the time that I really emerged as</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.710" end="00:05:19.040" style="s2">an adult theoretical physics was in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.560" end="00:05:22.130" style="s2">great deal of difficulty in trouble and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.040" end="00:05:24.920" style="s2">I think as I came to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.130" end="00:05:26.780" style="s2">there was a big story that was going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.920" end="00:05:28.280" style="s2">affect everything that I cared about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.780" end="00:05:30.680" style="s2">was going to affect the markets it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.280" end="00:05:32.840" style="s2">gonna affect our families our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.680" end="00:05:35.810" style="s2">ourselves our security and that story is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.840" end="00:05:38.780" style="s2">the story of what happens when humans</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.810" end="00:05:41.300" style="s2">get addicted to high levels of broadly</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.780" end="00:05:43.820" style="s2">distributed stable technology let growth</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.300" end="00:05:46.040" style="s2">and then are denied the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.820" end="00:05:48.440" style="s2">continue on that path that means that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.040" end="00:05:54.110" style="s2">you&#39;re set up potentially for war for</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.440" end="00:05:56.300" style="s2">civil unrest for communism if people try</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.110" end="00:05:58.850" style="s2">to grab what their neighbor has or</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.300" end="00:06:01.130" style="s2">fascism if people try to maintain order</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.850" end="00:06:04.460" style="s2">at all costs I define this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.130" end="00:06:06.980" style="s2">an ego or an embedded growth obligation</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.460" end="00:06:09.770" style="s2">and an embedded growth obligation is how</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.980" end="00:06:13.640" style="s2">fast the structure has to grow in order</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.770" end="00:06:17.860" style="s2">to maintain its honest positions so if</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.640" end="00:06:20.360" style="s2">you have a situation in which you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.860" end="00:06:23.420" style="s2">trial lawyers and they&#39;re supported by</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.360" end="00:06:25.730" style="s2">various associates and the associates</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.420" end="00:06:28.670" style="s2">all want to become partners and trial</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.730" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">lawyers themselves then what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.670" end="00:06:33.650" style="s2">you have a situation where the law firm</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:35.780" style="s2">has to grow at a very fast clip if all</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.650" end="00:06:38.480" style="s2">those people are going to be satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.780" end="00:06:40.910" style="s2">with their job decisions well very</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.480" end="00:06:42.950" style="s2">quickly that ability to grow runs out</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.910" end="00:06:44.840" style="s2">and then people want to know why am i</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.950" end="00:06:46.070" style="s2">stuck in a position going nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.840" end="00:06:47.630" style="s2">well the same thing was happening in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.070" end="00:06:49.460" style="s2">theoretical physics is happening in</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.630" end="00:06:51.320" style="s2">mathematics it was happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.460" end="00:06:53.900" style="s2">pension funds it was happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.320" end="00:06:56.180" style="s2">absolutely everywhere except for a small</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.900" end="00:06:58.490" style="s2">number of places like startups and hedge</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.180" end="00:07:01.880" style="s2">funds which were a period of time were</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.490" end="00:07:03.950" style="s2">able to buck that trend and as I came to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.880" end="00:07:08.840" style="s2">understand that we were in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.950" end="00:07:14.060" style="s2">society-wide Ponzi scheme since the late</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.840" end="00:07:15.740" style="s2">60s early 70s and that there was no way</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.060" end="00:07:19.430" style="s2">to continue to grow our way out</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.709" end="00:23:31.339" style="s2">guess is is that the climate consensus</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.779" end="00:23:33.919" style="s2">is probably correct in some sense but</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.339" end="00:23:38.149" style="s2">many of us are very disturbed by our</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:40.940" style="s2">ability to see incentives pushing people</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.149" end="00:23:46.429" style="s2">to hold certain conclusions so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:48.499" style="s2">think that that structure is enforced by</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.429" end="00:23:50.869" style="s2">taking anyone who&#39;s outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.499" end="00:23:53.479" style="s2">consensus and attaching concepts to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.869" end="00:23:56.989" style="s2">their name so one of the experiments I</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.479" end="00:23:59.299" style="s2">tried was controversial professor Paul</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.989" end="00:24:02.989" style="s2">Krugman versus controversial professor</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.299" end="00:24:05.209" style="s2">or Jordan Peterson Paul Krugman has been</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.989" end="00:24:07.609" style="s2">a controversial professor professor for</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.209" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">decades but there wasn&#39;t a single hit on</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.609" end="00:24:12.109" style="s2">all of Google for the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:13.820" style="s2">controversial professor Paul Krugman</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.109" end="00:24:15.379" style="s2">because this is one of the tricks inside</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.820" end="00:24:18.200" style="s2">of what I called the gut gated</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.379" end="00:24:20.989" style="s2">institutional narrative or the Jin so in</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.200" end="00:24:25.789" style="s2">the Jin the way it works is that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.989" end="00:24:30.469" style="s2">have these set phrases could be you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.789" end="00:24:33.349" style="s2">controversial strong man Bashar al-asad</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.469" end="00:24:35.959" style="s2">okay well what is that telling us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.349" end="00:24:37.969" style="s2">the news media opining that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.959" end="00:24:40.369" style="s2">picking aside and that he should be on</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.969" end="00:24:43.190" style="s2">the opposite side so when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.369" end="00:24:46.609" style="s2">situation where the news media wants to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.190" end="00:24:48.409" style="s2">promote somebody like Paul Krugman they</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.609" end="00:24:50.539" style="s2">don&#39;t call him controversial professor</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.409" end="00:24:53.149" style="s2">Paul Krugman they call him New York</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.539" end="00:24:55.969" style="s2">Times columnist or Nobel laureate Paul</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.149" end="00:24:57.769" style="s2">Krugman but if it&#39;s Jordan Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.969" end="00:24:59.989" style="s2">Jordan hasn&#39;t signed up for some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.769" end="00:25:01.999" style="s2">consensus position he has to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.989" end="00:25:03.379" style="s2">controversial professor Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.999" end="00:25:05.929" style="s2">now it&#39;s true that he&#39;s a controversial</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.379" end="00:25:08.269" style="s2">professor but that&#39;s actually the gated</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.929" end="00:25:10.789" style="s2">institutional narrative special language</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.269" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">for telling the audience who the good</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.789" end="00:25:14.749" style="s2">guys and the bad guys are and if you go</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:17.539" style="s2">back to professional wrestling this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.749" end="00:25:19.549" style="s2">would be called heels and baby faces or</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.539" end="00:25:21.559" style="s2">faces and so the idea is that Paul</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.549" end="00:25:22.160" style="s2">Krugman would be a face and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.559" end="00:25:25.220" style="s2">Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.160" end="00:25:26.690" style="s2">be a heel but instead of being open</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.220" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">about the fact that wrestling is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.690" end="00:25:34.340" style="s2">simulated performance sport in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:35.960" style="s2">journalistic endeavor we pretend the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.340" end="00:25:39.280" style="s2">journalism is actually a search for</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.960" end="00:25:39.280" style="s2">truth which I find hysterically</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:47.670" style="s2">and you&#39;ve described this as kayfabe in</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.030" end="00:25:48.780" style="s2">the past rightfully can you explain what</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.670" end="00:25:51.480" style="s2">that is to people who&#39;d maybe not heard</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.780" end="00:25:53.160" style="s2">that sure I think one of the problems is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.480" end="00:25:55.620" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have good language for</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.160" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">dealing with multi-layered deception and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.620" end="00:25:59.070" style="s2">the two places that I thought had pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">good language with the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.070" end="00:26:04.650" style="s2">community and professional wrestling so</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:06.810" style="s2">professional wrestling was the easier</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.650" end="00:26:09.210" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to get spooks to give up their</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.810" end="00:26:11.900" style="s2">secrets so what I did is I started to</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.210" end="00:26:16.020" style="s2">look into professional wrestling and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.900" end="00:26:18.330" style="s2">what is order all of the terms that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.020" end="00:26:20.460" style="s2">have to maintain to keep track what the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.330" end="00:26:23.300" style="s2">actual storylines are with the simulated</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.460" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">storyline sometimes you have a simulated</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.300" end="00:26:28.860" style="s2">storyline that apparently breaks into</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:30.180" style="s2">actual reality or like you&#39;re breaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.860" end="00:26:32.520" style="s2">the fourth wall but it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.180" end="00:26:36.660" style="s2">controlled structure where you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.520" end="00:26:39.540" style="s2">in a fake story so they call things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.660" end="00:26:45.810" style="s2">are fake works and they call things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.540" end="00:26:49.740" style="s2">are real shoots so a a worked shoot is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.810" end="00:26:52.260" style="s2">actually something that is set inside of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.740" end="00:26:54.060" style="s2">a fake storyline is apparently real and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.260" end="00:26:56.520" style="s2">breaks the fourth wall but is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.060" end="00:26:58.830" style="s2">fake so you&#39;re talking about tertiary</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.520" end="00:27:00.420" style="s2">and eventually quaternary levels of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.830" end="00:27:02.430" style="s2">deception I don&#39;t think the human mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.420" end="00:27:06.150" style="s2">can do much more than four layers of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.430" end="00:27:08.190" style="s2">life but kayfabe is the organized</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.150" end="00:27:11.370" style="s2">structure of lies that undergirds</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.190" end="00:27:13.020" style="s2">professional wrestling and is kept it as</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.370" end="00:27:17.460" style="s2">a simulated sport for about a century</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.020" end="00:27:20.370" style="s2">all sorts of human activity vir between</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.460" end="00:27:22.740" style="s2">utter terror and boredom and why is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.370" end="00:27:25.320" style="s2">well because if something is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.740" end="00:27:29.070" style="s2">unbounded negative potential experience</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.320" end="00:27:31.860" style="s2">people are very hesitant to engage so if</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.070" end="00:27:33.420" style="s2">two wrestlers can really do damage to</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.860" end="00:27:36.030" style="s2">each other they&#39;re gonna circle each</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.420" end="00:27:38.280" style="s2">other for a very long time before</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.030" end="00:27:40.530" style="s2">engaging because they don&#39;t want to risk</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.280" end="00:27:41.940" style="s2">anything that they don&#39;t have to so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.530" end="00:27:43.860" style="s2">could have bouts that would go on for</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.940" end="00:27:47.580" style="s2">four or five hours and basically nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.860" end="00:27:49.680" style="s2">happened well this is true in all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.580" end="00:27:51.390" style="s2">of endeavors people in the know and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.680" end="00:27:53.250" style="s2">finance don&#39;t really want to risk their</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.390" end="00:27:54.930" style="s2">money so they come up with all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.250" end="00:27:55.170" style="s2">elaborate ways to make sure that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.930" end="00:27:57.990" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.170" end="00:28:00.360" style="s2">to be okay no matter what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.990" end="00:28:02.930" style="s2">politics the same is true nobody wants</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.360" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">to simply find that they&#39;re out of a job</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.930" end="00:28:10.250" style="s2">because they lost an election so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:12.900" style="s2">an elaborate revolving door between</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.250" end="00:28:13.760" style="s2">politically related occupations like</p>

<p begin="00:28:13.760" end="00:28:20.040" style="s2">or lobbying and actually being a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.210" end="00:28:23.820" style="s2">representative so you have all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.040" end="00:28:27.420" style="s2">fakery that is entitled that is intended</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.820" end="00:28:29.700" style="s2">rather to make stable careers for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.420" end="00:28:31.980" style="s2">participants and to present an engaging</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.700" end="00:28:34.920" style="s2">and regular product for those in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.980" end="00:28:37.680" style="s2">audience and so I believe that in some</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.920" end="00:28:42.630" style="s2">sense what you&#39;re seeing is what I call</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.680" end="00:28:46.760" style="s2">K fabrication where real activities that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.630" end="00:28:50.820" style="s2">are dangerous and or boring tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.760" end="00:28:54.360" style="s2">sanitized by the participants so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.820" end="00:28:57.930" style="s2">they can present and as if product to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.360" end="00:29:00.150" style="s2">those outside of the structure and not</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.930" end="00:29:01.680" style="s2">themselves get hurt and continue to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.150" end="00:29:03.030" style="s2">money off of it and I think that that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.320" end="00:32:01.640" style="s2">think we&#39;ve run out of time and so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:05.780" style="s2">think some of us are somewhat</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.370" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">that everybody in the IDW is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.390" end="00:32:24.440" style="s2">disagreeable in the</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.750" end="00:32:41.779" style="s2">against you and I think that that trait</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.429" end="00:32:44.179" style="s2">is extremely rare</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.779" end="00:32:47.690" style="s2">do you see the IDW is primarily a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.179" end="00:32:52.130" style="s2">political project no I don&#39;t I see it</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.690" end="00:32:56.809" style="s2">primarily as a precursor to anything</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.130" end="00:32:58.730" style="s2">decent it&#39;s what has to succeed for us</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.809" end="00:33:00.020" style="s2">to have a political conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.730" end="00:33:03.559" style="s2">think we&#39;re having a political</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.020" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">conversation either internationally or</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.559" end="00:33:07.429" style="s2">nationally I think we have people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">are talking about nonsense positions we</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.429" end="00:33:10.429" style="s2">just went back to the immigration</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">position there are only two positions</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.429" end="00:33:14.690" style="s2">I&#39;m convinced aren&#39;t political one is</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.350" end="00:33:27.770" style="s2">these are the actual positions so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:29.270" style="s2">don&#39;t think that we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.770" end="00:33:31.250" style="s2">political conversation I think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.270" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2">what&#39;s been going on is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.250" end="00:33:36.020" style="s2">mainstream media has been playing</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:37.399" style="s2">keep-away ball right so this game where</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.020" end="00:33:38.870" style="s2">you&#39;re throwing the ball over somebody</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.399" end="00:33:40.100" style="s2">who&#39;s trying to catch it now the public</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.870" end="00:33:42.950" style="s2">has been trying to get in on this</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.100" end="00:33:45.140" style="s2">conversation but what keeps happening is</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.950" end="00:33:47.090" style="s2">is that our fake left and our fake right</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.140" end="00:33:49.610" style="s2">are engaged in a completely fake</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.090" end="00:33:52.010" style="s2">conversation about fake items including</p>

<p begin="00:33:52.010" end="00:33:56.059" style="s2">pushing out and then claiming to fight</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.440" end="00:33:59.390" style="s2">fake news so the whole thing is so</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.059" end="00:34:00.649" style="s2">saturated in falsehood that people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.390" end="00:34:02.929" style="s2">waking up to the idea</p>

<p begin="00:34:02.929" end="00:34:06.740" style="s2">like for people to actually have a</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.740" end="00:34:11.990" style="s2">time it takes you know in general it</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.899" end="00:34:13.909" style="s2">can&#39;t be done with four or five voices</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.990" end="00:34:15.609" style="s2">on a panel in 10 minutes with a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.909" end="00:34:17.960" style="s2">commercial interruptions they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.609" end="00:34:19.909" style="s2">almost nothing can be discussed that way</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.960" end="00:34:21.619" style="s2">and what&#39;s what&#39;s worse is that the very</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.619" end="00:34:25.550" style="s2">it are never going to be invited on to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.060" end="00:34:27.320" style="s2">those programs in a way the people in</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.550" end="00:34:29.690" style="s2">the IDW have been selected for like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.320" end="00:34:31.800" style="s2">lot of them have had quite high-profile</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.690" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">encounters you look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.800" end="00:34:39.640" style="s2">Sam Harris with Ben Affleck or you look</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:41.770" style="s2">at Brett Weinstein and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.640" end="00:34:43.630" style="s2">that they&#39;ve in some way had to live out</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.770" end="00:34:44.860" style="s2">their ideas there&#39;s a sense of bravery</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.630" end="00:34:45.490" style="s2">that they&#39;ve had to stick up for</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.490" end="00:34:49.420" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and C 16 I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.320" end="00:34:51.310" style="s2">could you can list a lot of times where</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.420" end="00:34:52.780" style="s2">as you said they had to be that one</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.310" end="00:34:54.490" style="s2">person who was thinking a certain thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.780" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">no I mean I think I made the point</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.490" end="00:35:00.730" style="s2">probably on the Rubin report that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:03.730" style="s2">going on is that when you ask any large</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.730" end="00:35:05.560" style="s2">collection of people to salute a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.730" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">nonsensical flag and pledge allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.560" end="00:35:10.270" style="s2">to it and more or less everyone makes</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:12.130" style="s2">the calculation</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.270" end="00:35:14.680" style="s2">I guess if this is going to get me</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.130" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">through my day I&#39;ll salute any flag then</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.680" end="00:35:19.810" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the one gal or one guy who</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to well my observation is</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.810" end="00:35:24.130" style="s2">that that person is usually sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:26.650" style="s2">an entire mountain of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.130" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">thoughts that they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.650" end="00:35:31.630" style="s2">freedom to simply make a convenience</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.040" end="00:35:35.290" style="s2">readjustment and so from that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.630" end="00:35:37.990" style="s2">perspective yeah in general if you ask a</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:27.010" style="s2">mainstream is pretending for the most</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.240" end="00:38:28.900" style="s2">part not to notice that this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.010" end="00:38:30.940" style="s2">is existing which is fascinating and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.900" end="00:38:33.609" style="s2">you&#39;ve described this as a civil war</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.940" end="00:38:36.039" style="s2">within the left could you could you</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.609" end="00:38:40.450" style="s2">explain what you mean by that sure the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.039" end="00:38:43.240" style="s2">left that I relate to is the left that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.450" end="00:38:45.789" style="s2">realizes that the past cannot supply the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.240" end="00:38:48.700" style="s2">answers and that we have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.789" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">progress because we can&#39;t stay here it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.700" end="00:38:54.190" style="s2">is not the left that believes we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:56.589" style="s2">wish ourselves into a beautiful future</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.190" end="00:38:58.660" style="s2">by pretending that the Reap that the</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.660" end="00:39:03.910" style="s2">so I think that the key thing that it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.420" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">an agreement between these two groups is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.910" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">that we have to get to some sort of</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:13.960" style="s2">progressive in progressivism where we</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.500" end="00:39:15.640" style="s2">are deeply divided and you know again</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.960" end="00:39:19.990" style="s2">these are the divisions that are is much</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.640" end="00:39:24.490" style="s2">worse than between left and right how</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.990" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">these absolutely imbecilic figures</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.490" end="00:39:29.380" style="s2">believe that you can just wish yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:31.060" style="s2">into paradise that you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.380" end="00:39:33.430" style="s2">worry about markets that you can just</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.500" end="00:39:39.670" style="s2">whit of sense or you know you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.840" end="00:39:42.910" style="s2">to wish human beings to be both</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.670" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">simultaneously non-diverse so that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.910" end="00:39:47.830" style="s2">can argue that any difference in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:50.770" style="s2">pro-rata shares of a group in any</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.830" end="00:39:52.420" style="s2">occupation is evidence of oppression and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.770" end="00:39:53.470" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to turn around and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.420" end="00:39:55.030" style="s2">argue that people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.470" end="00:39:57.840" style="s2">incredibly different because we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.030" end="00:40:01.830" style="s2">get a huge benefit from diversity I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.840" end="00:40:04.080" style="s2">this is not even self consistent this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.830" end="00:40:06.610" style="s2">this would be offensive to an</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.080" end="00:40:08.530" style="s2">intelligent five-year-old so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.610" end="00:40:11.740" style="s2">really believe that these progressives</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.530" end="00:40:14.770" style="s2">as they call themselves and regressives</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.740" end="00:40:16.900" style="s2">as some of us call them are even making</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.770" end="00:40:20.770" style="s2">serious intellectual points they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.900" end="00:40:24.100" style="s2">of trolling by pretending to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.770" end="00:40:26.290" style="s2">all things that just gum up the works</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.100" end="00:40:28.540" style="s2">and so it&#39;s very important to me that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.290" end="00:40:31.960" style="s2">not only do we not really spend time</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.540" end="00:40:34.180" style="s2">debating people who are not serious in</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.960" end="00:40:36.670" style="s2">their intellectualism but that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.180" end="00:40:40.320" style="s2">realize that it is important to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.670" end="00:40:45.480" style="s2">diversity of mature and important ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.320" end="00:40:48.670" style="s2">that we not spend undue effort engaging</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.480" end="00:40:50.770" style="s2">ideas that are functioning very</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.670" end="00:40:55.570" style="s2">differently from regular conversation it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.770" end="00:40:58.260" style="s2">is as if somebody asks should we have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.570" end="00:41:00.550" style="s2">diverse dinner tonight well we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.260" end="00:41:02.980" style="s2">invite somebody from this position from</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.550" end="00:41:04.510" style="s2">that country from this gender and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.980" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">should we should we invite a suicide</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.510" end="00:41:09.550" style="s2">bomber well if you&#39;re a suicide bomber</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:12.010" style="s2">you&#39;re that bit of diversity is going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.550" end="00:41:13.620" style="s2">take down the entire conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.010" end="00:41:15.880" style="s2">as well as all the people at the table</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.620" end="00:41:18.820" style="s2">right well these are like suicide</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.880" end="00:41:20.530" style="s2">bombers in terms of their ideas they are</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.820" end="00:41:22.390" style="s2">attaching themselves to real</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.530" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">conversations and blowing up the</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:30.820" style="s2">speak and I think what we need is we</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.090" end="00:41:35.500" style="s2">need to realize that the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.820" end="00:41:38.260" style="s2">ideas that have to be explored hinges</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.500" end="00:41:40.570" style="s2">are not allowing in bad diversity that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.260" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">is you don&#39;t want a single person at the</p>
