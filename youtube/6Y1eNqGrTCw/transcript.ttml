<p begin="00:00:05.609" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">center today I want to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.429" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">about why we&#39;ve created this summer</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:17.760" style="s2">program for young adults at all the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:20.640" style="s2">lower soul I&#39;ve been working with adults</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.760" end="00:00:23.490" style="s2">for over 30 years in professional and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.640" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">community organizations as a coach as an</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.490" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">educator as a spiritual teacher and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:35.160" style="s2">been writing philosophy on integral</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">process philosophy for many many years</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.160" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">and the trajectory that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">working with is being able to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:48.149" style="s2">explicit new ways of being new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:50.930" style="s2">thinking new ways of creating insight</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.149" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">new capacities of cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.930" end="00:00:56.010" style="s2">consciousness and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">difficulties that always comes up either</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.010" end="00:01:04.430" style="s2">an individual or group basis is the need</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">to deconstruct or dismantle or</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.430" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">disentangle the old ways of being the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:13.189" style="s2">old structures the way that we&#39;ve grown</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">up in the world the old world and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.189" end="00:01:17.430" style="s2">social structures and the individual</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:20.520" style="s2">structures of the self the way they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.430" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">been kind of coagulated and contracted</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.520" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">and built up as layers and really limit</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:31.950" style="s2">our ability to work directly with our</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">inner knowing or intuition and as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">been doing this work for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">grown up with my own colleagues and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">community our own children have become</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:46.890" style="s2">older and gone off to college and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:49.259" style="s2">occurred to us that they were in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.890" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">same situation that we were in many many</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">years ago that they were they still had</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:57.259" style="s2">the enthusiasm for the new but they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.659" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">entering really the same types of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.259" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">institutionalized education the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:04.380" style="s2">types of institutionalized careers were</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">ahead of them and that it became very</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.380" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">frustrating to see now that we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">finally done all this work on ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:13.379" style="s2">and opened ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:16.049" style="s2">to new ways of being that we were seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.379" end="00:02:19.909" style="s2">this generations being put through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.049" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">same standardized institutionalized</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.909" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">socialized conventionalized static boxes</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:30.780" style="s2">and we thought well you know why should</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:33.239" style="s2">young people who don&#39;t yet have these</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.780" end="00:02:36.659" style="s2">limiting structures go through all that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.239" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2">and just in order to have their family</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.659" end="00:02:43.170" style="s2">their career and then at an older</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.900" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">midlife crisis age sit down and groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">like we were working with to deconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">all that so I started doing a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:52.769" style="s2">research I started doing presentations</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">for example where young people would</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.769" end="00:02:57.629" style="s2">come in and I would organize the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">presentations in an interactive way and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.629" end="00:03:05.220" style="s2">experiment and sure enough i found that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">young people had a natural intuition for</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.220" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">thinking in new terms for thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:13.939" style="s2">more participatory ways for thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:16.590" style="s2">open and insightful ways for</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.939" end="00:03:18.389" style="s2">acknowledging a deeper spirituality a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.590" end="00:03:22.079" style="s2">deeper kind of inner knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.389" end="00:03:27.449" style="s2">intuition and this really gave me the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.079" end="00:03:29.459" style="s2">incentive to work toward gathering and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.449" end="00:03:32.790" style="s2">assembling and working with the younger</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.459" end="00:03:35.699" style="s2">people so last year at one of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.790" end="00:03:37.530" style="s2">workshops I met Zach schlosser and after</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.699" end="00:03:40.349" style="s2">the workshop we really started talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.530" end="00:03:43.620" style="s2">about working together and building a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.349" end="00:03:46.919" style="s2">program that could create synergy</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.620" end="00:03:53.010" style="s2">amongst young people who deep inside</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.919" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">know that the the experiences that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.010" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">are having in conventional social</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.790" style="s2">programs is limiting them that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">don&#39;t get an affirmation for what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.790" end="00:04:04.609" style="s2">can see is real in their future a real</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">possibility real potential in the future</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.609" end="00:04:10.409" style="s2">you know I like to do workshops with</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:14.519" style="s2">young people will where I come in I say</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.409" end="00:04:19.030" style="s2">something in you wants to move and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.519" end="00:04:21.910" style="s2">job is to facilitate that movement and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.030" end="00:04:25.900" style="s2">and that movement has its own natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.910" end="00:04:28.180" style="s2">genius and natural intelligence and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.900" end="00:04:32.380" style="s2">for this generation I feel that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.180" end="00:04:35.889" style="s2">many of you out there who can feel this</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.380" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">inside themselves that in this time of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.889" end="00:04:43.000" style="s2">rapid change and deinstitutionalization</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">and decentralization and distributed</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.000" end="00:04:50.190" style="s2">agency that there&#39;s a real opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:53.080" style="s2">for natural leaders to step forward and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.190" end="00:04:56.290" style="s2">recreate recreate the generative</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.080" end="00:04:59.169" style="s2">structures that will bring in the new so</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.290" end="00:05:02.620" style="s2">that we can make a leap and overcome</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.169" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">some of these situational problems some</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.620" end="00:05:09.190" style="s2">of these structures that people in many</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:13.390" style="s2">many generations before you have had to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.190" end="00:05:15.190" style="s2">really work hard to dismantle at many</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.390" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">stages of their lives so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.190" end="00:05:23.020" style="s2">a is a unique and historic epochal</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.860" end="00:05:26.350" style="s2">opportunity to gather the right people</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.020" end="00:05:29.650" style="s2">to find out who we are to assemble these</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.350" end="00:05:31.870" style="s2">natural born leaders to work to be able</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.650" end="00:05:35.169" style="s2">to work directly with our inner knowing</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.870" end="00:05:38.470" style="s2">to make that that&#39;s late in and implicit</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.169" end="00:05:42.610" style="s2">and not well defined make that to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.470" end="00:05:45.810" style="s2">explicit to be open and available to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.610" end="00:05:49.090" style="s2">everyone of your generation and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.810" end="00:05:52.060" style="s2">generations to come and so that what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.090" end="00:05:55.419" style="s2">calling but is what is calling forth</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.060" end="00:06:01.020" style="s2">what is being shaped in US and through</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.419" end="00:06:05.650" style="s2">us can become an actual realization and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.020" end="00:06:09.310" style="s2">really propel us into the future that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.650" end="00:06:11.890" style="s2">want to see so many many many people of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.310" end="00:06:14.350" style="s2">your generations of these younger</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.890" end="00:06:17.560" style="s2">generations want to make a positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.350" end="00:06:20.919" style="s2">contribution in world want to make their</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.560" end="00:06:23.380" style="s2">life an authentic life well worth living</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.919" end="00:06:24.529" style="s2">they want to help others they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.380" end="00:06:28.789" style="s2">in service</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.529" end="00:06:30.859" style="s2">they can see that possibility so closely</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.789" end="00:06:33.019" style="s2">they can taste it but the structures</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.859" end="00:06:36.979" style="s2">aren&#39;t there the paths haven&#39;t been laid</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.019" end="00:06:39.979" style="s2">out and this is what we want to do in</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.979" end="00:06:42.919" style="s2">this first small step at the summer</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.979" end="00:06:47.569" style="s2">school at all the Lord to really start</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.919" end="00:06:50.659" style="s2">to create this community of leaders that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.569" end="00:06:54.669" style="s2">can really look into the future and see</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.659" end="00:07:00.649" style="s2">the extraordinary possibility that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.669" end="00:07:03.889" style="s2">being called from these younger</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.649" end="00:07:07.099" style="s2">generations that have this implicit</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.889" end="00:07:09.889" style="s2">understanding of the world that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.099" end="00:07:13.459" style="s2">possible that has never been possible</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.889" end="00:07:15.379" style="s2">before so I really hope to meet you and</p>
